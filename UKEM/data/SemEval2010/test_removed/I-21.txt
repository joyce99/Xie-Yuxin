abstract 
we investigate a framework where agents search for 
satisfying products by using referrals from other agents our 
model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and 
the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a 
module governing the local behaviour of agents with a 
module governing the structure and function of the underlying 
network of agents local behaviour incorporates a 
satisficing model of choice a set of rules governing the 
interactions between agents including learning about the 
trustworthiness of other agents over time and external constraints 
on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or 
switching costs local behaviour takes place on a network 
substrate across which agents exchange positive and 
negative information about products we use various degree 
distributions dictating the extent of connectivity and 
incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential 
attachment in our network models we compare the 
effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures 
for easy and hard choice tasks and evaluate how this 
effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers

 introduction 
defection behaviour that is why people might stop 
using a particular product or service largely depends on the 
psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward 
the currently-used product and the availability of more 
attractive alternatives however in many cases the 
decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on 
various external constraints that are placed on switching 
behaviour either by the structure of the market by the 
suppliers themselves in the guise of formal or informal contracts 
or other so-called  switching costs or market barriers 
the key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which 
psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making 
is constrained by market barriers so that agents are 
prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would 
be most satisfying in an unconstrained market 
while the level of satisfaction with a currently-used 
product will largely be a function of one s own experiences of 
the product over the period of use knowledge of any 
potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained 
by augmenting the information gained from personal 
experiences with information about the experiences of others 
gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication moreover 
there is an important relationship between market barriers 
and word-of-mouth communication in the presence of 
market barriers constrained economic agents trapped in 
dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this 
information to other agents in the absence of such 
barriers agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products 
and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be 
of the positive variety since the imposition of at least some 
forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken 
by product suppliers these relationships may be key to the 
success of a particular supplier 
in addition the relationship between market barriers and 
word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one the 
structure and function of the network across which 
word-ofmouth communication is conducted and particularly the 
way in which the network changes in response to the 
imposition of market barriers also plays a role in determining 
which market barriers are most effective these are complex 
questions and our main interest in this paper is to address 
the simpler problems of investigating a the extent to which 
network structure influences the ways in which information 
is disseminated across a network of decision makers b the 
extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination 
and c the consequent implications for overall system 
performance in terms of the proportion of agents who are 
satisfied and the speed with which the system moves towards 
equilibrium which we term stability 
an agent-based model framework allows for an 
investigation at the level of the individual decision maker at the 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
product-level or at the level of the entire system we are 
particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for 
the latter two the model presented here allows for an 
investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried 
out in a complex environment where at every time period 
each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of 
products to purchase these decisions are based on 
multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as 
well as from the referrals of agents agents use this gathered 
information to search for a product that exceeds their 
satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may 
be said to be satisficing rather than optimising e g 
market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue 
to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory 
performance we allow agents to hold different opinions about 
the performance of a product so that as a result a referral 
from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience 
agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of 
other agents referrals according to the success of past 
referrals and use these evaluations to judge whether or not 
to make use of any further referrals the level of 
satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently 
dynamic being subject to random fluctuations in product 
performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount 
the performance of a product they have used for a long time 
- a process akin to habituation 
 background 
 word-of-mouth communication 
much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication 
in the context of social psychology and marketing research 
has focused on its forms and determinants suggesting that 
word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways it may be 
induced by a particular transaction or product experience 
particularly when that transaction has been an especially 
good or bad one it may be solicited from others 
usually when the task involved is difficult ambiguous or 
new and it may come about when talk of products and 
brands arise in the course of informal conversation 
particularly when a  passion for the subject is present 
wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the 
communication is credible with credibility decisions based 
largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional 
qualification informal training social distance and 
similarity of views and experiences 
the role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour 
of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and 
simulation models the analytical work in investigates 
the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to 
conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient 
outcomes e g choosing an alternative that is on average better 
than another finding that conformity of behaviour arises 
when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication 
from only a small number of other agents but that this 
conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the 
tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms 
the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially 
efficient outcome simulation-based investigations of 
wordof-mouth have focused on developing strategies for 
ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where 
all agents are satisfied largely by learning about the 
effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of 
inertia in individual behaviour these studies have found that 
given a sufficient number of service providers honest 
referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions 
than deceitful ones and that both forms of word-of-mouth 
provide better performance than none at all the 
simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the 
environment than the analytical models in which referrals 
are at random and only two choices are available and the 
work in in particular is a close antecedent of the work 
presented in this paper our main contribution being to include 
network structure and the constraints imposed by market 
barriers as additional effects 
 market barriers 
the extent to which market barriers are influential in 
affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from 
economists interested in how barriers distort competition 
and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer 
choices while the formalisation of the idea that 
satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the 
work of fishbein and ajzen on reasoned choice nearly 
all writers including fishbein and ajzen recognise that this 
relationship can be thwarted by circumstances e g 
a useful typology of market barriers distinguishes 
 transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of 
changing e g in financial services  learning barriers associated 
with deciding to replace well-known existing products and 
 contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term 
of the contract a different typology introduces the 
additional aspect of  relational barriers arising from 
personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of 
a particular product 
there is generally little empirical evidence on the 
relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the 
retention of a customer base and to the best of our knowledge 
no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate 
empirical findings burnham et al find that perceived 
market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in 
intention to stay with a product than that explained by 
satisfaction with the product and respectively and 
that so-called relational barriers are considerably more 
influential than either transactional or learning barriers further 
they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers 
to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers 
would seem to be weak simply put market barriers appear 
to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction 
and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally 
thought 
 model framework 
 product performance evaluations 
we use a problem representation in which at each time 
period every agent must decide which one of a set of 
products to choose let a ak k p be the set of agents 
b bi i n be the set of products and c cj j m 
be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be 
based i e the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice 
one let fj b → be an increasing function 
providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j so 
that and are the worst- and best-possible performances 
respectively and sij a × → be a subjective 
opinion function of agents the intrinsic performance of 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
product i on attribute j is given by fj bi however the 
subjective opinion of the level of performance of product i 
on attribute j given by agent k is given by sij ak fj bi 
all subsequent modelling is based on these subjective 
performance ratings for the purposes of this paper each agent 
belongs to one of three equally-sized groups with each group 
possessing its own subjective performance ratings 
we assume that the subjective performance ratings are 
not known a priori by the agents and it is their task to 
discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration 
and referral gathering in order to model this process we 
introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time 
t denoted by pij ak fj bi t initially all perceived 
performance ratings are set to zero so that the initial selection of a 
product is done randomly subsequent variation in product 
performance over time is modelled using two quantities a 
random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion 
ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary 
over purchase occasions for the same agent and a 
habituation discounting factor hikt tends to decrease the perceived 
performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in 
with repeated usage our habituation mechanism supposes 
that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product 
and is used to discount the performance of the product 
in most cases i e unless the habituation factor is one or 
extremely close to one this habituation-based discounting 
eventually leads to defection after which the level of 
habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being 
used more formally once a product i 
has been chosen by 
agent k the subjective level of performance is perceived and 
pi j ak fj b 
i t is set equal to si j ak fj b 
i hi kt jkt 
where jkt is distributed as n σ and hi kt is an 
decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has 
been exposed to i 
 
in evaluating the performance of a product agents make 
use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived 
performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction 
thresholds γk g k gmk with ≤ gik ≤ agent 
k will be satisfied with a product i 
selected in time t if 
pi j ak fj b 
i t ≥ gjk ∀j 
 decision processes 
in designing the mechanism by which agents make their 
choice decisions we allow for the possibility that satisfied 
agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying 
them satisfied agents stay with their current product with 
probability pr stay with a strategy prohibiting satisfied 
agents from moving e g obtained as a special case when 
pr stay 
a defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to 
choose by considering all other products for which it has 
information either by previous personal exploration or by 
referrals from other agents the selection of a new 
product begins by the agent identifying those products from 
which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance 
on all attributes i e those products for which δik where 
δik maxj gjk − pij ak fj bi t and selecting a 
product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to 
−δik if no satisfactory product exists or at least the agent 
is unaware of any such product the agent identifies those 
products that offer at least a minimum level of  acceptable 
performance γ− 
k the minimum level of acceptability is 
defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations 
across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i e 
a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik γ− 
k 
agents then select a product at random from the set of 
minimally acceptable products if the set of minimally 
acceptable products is empty agents select a product from the full 
set of products b at random 
the decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely 
similar to that of defecting satisfied agents with the 
exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will 
chose to explore a new product chosen at random from the 
set of remaining products with probability α with 
probability − α they will use a decision process like the one 
outlined above for satisfied agents 
 constraints on decision processes 
in some circumstances market barriers may exist that 
make switching between products more difficult 
particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of 
changing one s choice of product when barriers are present 
agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied but 
rather only when the performance evaluation drops below 
some critical level i e when δik β where β measures 
the strength of the market barriers although in this 
paper market barriers do not vary over products or time it is 
straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers 
take the general form β max β δtuse β 
 where β is a 
barrier to defection that is applied when the product is 
purchased for the first time e g a contractual agreement δ is 
the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional 
time period the product is used for and β 
is the maximum 
possible barrier and all three quantities are allowed to vary 
over products i e be a function of i 
 referral processes 
each agent is assumed to be connected to qk p agents 
i e to give and receive information from qk other agents 
the network over which word-of-mouth communication 
travels is governed by the small-world effect by which 
networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of 
agents into  communities and a short average path length 
between any two agents in the network and preferential 
attachment by which agents with greater numbers of 
existing connections are more likely to receive new ones 
this is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice 
with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or 
fewer lattice spacings and creating a small-world network 
by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections 
in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent 
with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to 
its number of existing connections this results in a 
distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent 
i e a distribution of qk that is strongly skewed to the right 
in fact if the construction of the network is slightly modified 
so that new connections are added with preferential 
attachment but no connections are removed the distribution of 
qk follows a power-law distribution but a distribution with a 
non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal 
number of connections seems more realistic in the context 
of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems 
when an agent purchases a product they inform each 
of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to 
pr spr k δik where pr spr k is the basic propensity 
of agent k 
to spread word of mouth and δik captures the 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
extent to which the agent s most recent experience was 
satisfying or dissatisfying agents are thus more likely to spread 
word-of-mouth about products that they have just 
experienced as either very good or very bad if an agent receives 
information on the same product from more than one agent 
he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents with 
selection probabilities proportional to tt k 
 k the degree 
to which previous referrals from k 
to k were successful i e 
resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k thus agents 
have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents 
referrals and use this information to accept or block future 
referrals in this paper we employ a learning condition in 
which tt k 
 k is multiplied by a factor of following an 
unsatisfying referral and a factor of following a satisfying 
referral the asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that 
employed in and is motivated by the fact that an 
unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a 
referring agent k 
does not possess the same subjective 
preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the 
converse 
other referral process are certainly possible for 
example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather 
than choosing only the most-trusted source our main 
reason for employing the process described above is 
simplicity integrating different sources considerably complicates 
the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others 
and raises further questions about the precise nature of the 
integration 
after determining who contacts whom the actual 
referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the 
perceived level of performance of an experience of product 
i 
from the referring agent k 
to the accepting agent k i e 
pi j ak fj bi t takes on the value pi j ak fj bi t− ∀j 
provided that agent k is not currently using i 
 information 
about other products is not transmitted and an agent will 
ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is 
currently using in effect the referral creates an expected 
level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for 
the product referred to which that agent may then use when 
making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the 
decision processes outlined in the previous section once an 
agent has personally experienced a product any expected 
performance levels suggested by previous referrals are 
replaced by the experienced subjective performance levels 
sij ak fj bi jkt and tt k 
 k is adjusted depending on 
whether the experience was a satisfying one or not 
 experimental results 
we examine the behaviour of a system of agents 
consisting of three groups of and agents respectively 
agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous 
subjective opinion functions sij simulations were run for 
time periods and twenty repetitions of each condition were 
used in order to generate aggregate results 
 choice task difficulty 
we begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on 
the ability of various network configurations to converge to 
a state in which an acceptable proportion of the 
population are satisfied in the  easy choice condition there are 
 products to choose from in the market evaluated over 
 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to for 
all groups there are therefore on average approximately 
 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular 
agent in the  hard choice condition there are 
products to choose from in the market still evaluated over 
attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 
 for all groups so there are on average approximately 
 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular 
agent locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more 
difficult under the  hard condition the effect of task 
difficulty is evaluated on three network structures 
corresponding to r random network r small-world 
network and r tight  communities of agents with

figure moderating effect of task difficulty on 
relationship between network structure r and system 
behaviour 
given a relatively easy task the system very quickly i e in 
little over time periods converges to a state in which 
just less than of agents are satisfied at any one time 
furthermore different network structures have very little 
influence on results so that only a single smoothed series 
is given for comparison with the  hard condition clearly 
there are enough agents independently solving the task i e 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
finding a satisfying brand to make the dissemination of 
information relatively independent of the ways in which 
connections are made however when it is more difficult to 
locate a satisfying product the structure of the network 
becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges 
to a stable state importantly the overall satisfaction level 
to which the system converges remains just below 
regardless of which network structure is used but convergence 
is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a 
small proportion of connections thus while the random 
network r converges quickest the small-world 
network r also shows a substantial improvement over 
the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional 
ring lattice this effect of the rewiring parameter r is much 
less pronounced for more highly-connected networks e g 
κ which suggests that the degree distribution of a 
network is a more important determinant of system behaviour 
than the way in which agents are connected to one another 
similar results are observed when looking at the market 
share achieved by the market leading product under each 
level of choice difficulty market share is essentially 
independent of network structure for the easy task with 
average share converging quickly to around set a more 
difficult task the convergence of market share to an 
approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the 
smallworld network with the random and tight community 
networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their 
equilibrium levels also interesting is the finding that 
equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be 
slightly of the order of - higher when network 
connections are non-random - the random network seems to 
suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other 
networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the 
market leading product 
 market barriers 
in the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of 
various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of 
agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction for 
simplicity we concentrate on the smaller set of products i e 
the  easy choice task discussed above but vary the 
number of connections that each agent begins with in order to 
simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution 
on system behaviour tables and show the effect of 
different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of 
agents that are satisfied at any one time and the 
equilibrium proportion of agents switching products moving in 
any one time period under various levels of market barriers 
constraining their behaviour in these two tables 
equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time 
periods to when the system is in equilibrium or 
extremely close to equilibrium table and make use of 
all time periods

three aspects are worth noting firstly there is a strong 
diminishing marginal return of additional connections 
beyond a small number the first few connections one makes 
increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 
from to for the first two contacts followed by a 
further increase of roughly to for the next four 
in contrast adding a further contacts improves relative 
satisfaction levels by less than secondly word-of-mouth 
communication continues to play an important role in 
improving the performance of the system even when market 
barriers are high in fact the role may even be more 
important in constrained conditions since the relative gains 
obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market 
barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles 
the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme 
barriers β finally it is clear that the mechanism by 
which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement 
 reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any 
particular column of tables and but that increases in 
degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely 
the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by 
reducing the average amount of time required to find a 
satisfying brand

perhaps the most interesting effects exerted by market 
barriers are those exerted over the market shares of leading 
products figure shows the cumulative market share 
captured by the top three products in the market over time for 
all types of market barriers using different degree 
distributions again two comments can be made firstly in the 
absence of market barriers a greater proportion of the 
market is captured by the market leading products when 
markets are highly-connected relative to when they are 
poorlyconnected this difference can amount to as much as 
and is explained by positive feedback within the more 
highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability 
that once a set of satisfying products have emerged one 
is kept informed about these leading products because at 
least one of one s contacts is using it secondly the 
relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in 
highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers in 
moving from β to β to β market leaders

figure effect of market barriers on the share of the market captured by the leading products 
in contrast no change in collective market share is observed 
when κ although convergence to equilibrium conditions 
is slower it seems reasonable to suggest that increases in 
negative word-of-mouth which occurs when an unsatisfied 
agent is prevented from switching to another product are 
particularly damaging to leading products when agents are 
well-connected and that under moderate to strong market 
barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by 
the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network 
table displays the number of attempted referrals both 
positive and negative as a function of degree distribution 
and extent of market barriers and shows that stronger 
market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive 
word-ofmouth communication and increase negative 
communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product 
relationships and that this effect is particularly pronounced for 
more highly-connected networks the reduction in the 
number of positive referrals as market barriers impose 
increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in table which 
shows the median number of product trials each agent makes 
per time period based on a referral from another agent 
whereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected 
network make substantially more reference-based product 
trials than agents in poorly-connected networks when 
barriers are severe both types of network carry only very little 
positive referral information this clearly has a relatively 
greater impact on the highly-connected network which 
relies on the spread of positive referral information to achieve 
higher satisfaction levels moreover this result might be 
even stronger in reality if agents in poorly-connected 
networks attempt to compensate for the relative sparcity of 
connections by making more forceful or persuasive referrals 
where they do occur

 conclusions and related work 
purchasing behaviour in many markets takes place on 
a substrate of networks of word-of-mouth communication 
across which agents exchange information about products 
and their likes and dislikes understanding the ways in 
which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence 
aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the 
underlying structural properties of the network and the 
local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network 
when making purchase decisions and when interacting with 
other agents these local rules are often constrained by the 
nature of a particular market or else imposed by 
strategic suppliers or social customs the proper modelling of a 
mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting 
behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of 
complex and interacting components networks of 
communication source credibility learning processes habituation 
and memory external constraints on behaviour theories of 
information transfer and adaptive behaviour in this 
paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in 
a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real 
world 
using the key notions of a limited communication 
network a simple learning process and a satisficing heuristic 
that may be subject to external constraints we showed 
the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both 
system effectiveness and stability that the degree 
distribution of a network is more influential than the way in 
which agents are connected but that both are important in 
more complex environments that rewiring even a small 
number of connections to create a small-world network can 
have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to 
satisficing distributions and market share allocations that 
word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements 
between products are constrained by market barriers and 
 that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a 
result of market barriers can reduce the market share 
collectively captured by leading brands but that this is dependent 
on the existence of a suitably well-connected network 
structure 
it is the final finding that is likely to be most 
surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field 
and suggests that it may not always be in the best 
interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent 
customers from leaving in poorly-connected networks the 
effect of barriers on market shares is slight in contrast in 
well-connected networks negative word-of-mouth can 
prevent agents from trying a product that they might 
otherwise have found satisfying and this can inflict significant 
harm on market share products with small market share 
 which in the context of our simulations is generally due to 
the product offering poor performance are relatively 
unaffected by negative word-of-mouth since most product trials 
are likely to be unsatisfying in any case 
agent-based modelling provides a natural way for 
beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in 
marketing systems naturally the usefulness of results is for the 
most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the 
two  modules comprising network structure and local 
behaviour on the network side future work might investigate 
the relationship between degree distributions the way 
connections are created and destroyed over time whether 
preferential attachment is influential and the extent to which 
social identity informs network strucutre all in larger 
networks of more heterogenous agents on the behavioural side 
one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds 
during the course of communication responses to systematic 
changes in product performances over time the integration 
of various information sources and different market barrier 
structures all these areas provide fascinating opportunities 
to introduce psychological realities into models of 
marketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the 
system under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions
