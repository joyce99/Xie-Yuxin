the problem of localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been 
regarded as very difficult to solve when considering the realities 
of real world environments in this paper we formally describe 
design implement and evaluate a novel localization system called 
spotlight our system uses the spatio-temporal properties of well 
controlled events in the network e g light to obtain the 
locations of sensor nodes we demonstrate that a high accuracy in 
localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware 
on the sensor nodes as required by other localization systems we 
evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of mica 
and xsm motes through performance evaluations of a real 
system deployed outdoors we obtain a cm localization error a 
sensor network with any number of nodes deployed in a m 
area can be localized in under minutes using a device that 
costs less than to the best of our knowledge this is the first 
report of a sub-meter localization error obtained in an outdoor

 introduction 
recently wireless sensor network systems have been used in 
many promising applications including military surveillance 
habitat monitoring wildlife tracking etc while 
many middleware services to support these applications have 
been designed and implemented successfully localization - finding 
the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult 
research challenges to be solved practically since most emerging 
applications based on networked sensor nodes require location 
awareness to assist their operations such as annotating sensed data 
with location context it is an indispensable requirement for a 
sensor node to be able to find its own location 
many approaches have been proposed in the literature 
 however it is still not clear 
how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed 
an on-board gps is a typical high-end solution which 
requires sophisticated hardware to achieve high resolution time 
synchronization with satellites the constraints on power and cost 
for tiny sensor nodes preclude this as a viable solution other 
solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among 
neighboring nodes the difficulties of these approaches are 
twofold first under constraints of form factor and power supply the 
effective ranges of such devices are very limited for example the 
effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the cricket 
system is less than meters when the sender and receiver are not 
facing each other second since most sensor nodes are static 
i e the location is not expected to change it is not cost-effective to 
equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time 
localization to overcome these limitations many range-free 
localization schemes have been proposed most of these schemes 
estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio 
connectivity information among neighboring nodes these 
approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware 
at the cost of a less accurate localization in addition the radio 
propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment 
dependent thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free 
localizations schemes with such limitations in mind this paper 
addresses the following research challenge how to reconcile the 
need for high accuracy in location estimation with the cost to 
achieve it our answer to this challenge is a localization system 
called spotlight this system employs an asymmetric architecture 
in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware other 
than what they currently have all the sophisticated hardware and 
computation reside on a single spotlight device the spotlight 
device uses a steerable laser light source illuminating the sensor 
nodes placed within a known terrain we demonstrate that this 
localization is much more accurate i e tens of centimeters than 
the range-based localization schemes and that it has a much longer 
effective range i e thousands of meters than the solutions based 
on ultra-sound acoustic ranging at the same time since only a 
single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole 
network the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add 
hardware components to the individual sensors 
 related work 
in this section we discuss prior work in localization in two major 
categories the range-based localization schemes which use either 
expensive per node ranging devices for high accuracy or less 
accurate ranging solutions as the received signal strength 
indicator rssi and the range-free schemes which use only 
connectivity information hop-by-hop as an indication of 
proximity among the nodes 
the localization problem is a fundamental research problem in 
many domains in the field of robotics it has been studied 
extensively the reported localization errors are on the 
order of tens of centimeters when using specialized ranging 
hardware i e laser range finder or ultrasound due to the high cost 
and non-negligible form factor of the ranging hardware these 
solutions can not be simply applied to sensor networks 
the rssi has been an attractive solution for estimating the 
distance between the sender and the receiver the radar system 
 uses the rssi to build a centralized repository of signal 
strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes 
the location of a mobile user is estimated within a few meters in 
a similar approach motetrack distributes the reference rssi 
values to the beacon nodes 
solutions that use rssi and do not require beacon nodes have 
also been proposed they all share the idea 
of using a mobile beacon the sensor nodes that receive the 
beacons apply different algorithms for inferring their location in 
 sichitiu proposes a solution in which the nodes that receive 
the beacon construct based on the rssi value a constraint on 
their position estimate in priyantha et al propose mal a 
localization method in which a mobile node moving strategically 
assists in measuring distances between node pairs until the 
constraints on distances generate a rigid graph in pathirana 
et al formulate the localization problem as an on-line estimation in 
a nonlinear dynamic system and proposes a robust extended 
kalman filter for solving it elnahrawy provides strong 
evidence of inherent limitations of localization accuracy using 
rssi in indoor environments 
a more precise ranging technique uses the time difference 
between a radio signal and an acoustic wave to obtain pair wise 
distances between sensor nodes this approach produces smaller 
localization errors at the cost of additional hardware the cricket 
location-support system can achieve a location granularity of 
tens of centimeters with short range ultrasound transceivers 
ahlos proposed by savvides et al employs time of 
arrival toa ranging techniques that require extensive hardware 
and solving relatively large nonlinear systems of equations a 
similar toa technique is employed in 
in simon et al implement a distributed system using 
acoustic ranging which locates a sniper in an urban terrain 
acoustic ranging for localization is also used by kwon et al 
the reported errors in localization vary from m to m 
depending on the type centralized vs distributed of the least 
square scaling algorithm used 
for wireless sensor networks ranging is a difficult option the 
hardware cost the energy expenditure the form factor the small 
range all are difficult compromises and it is hard to envision 
cheap unreliable and resource-constraint devices make use of 
range-based localization solutions however the high localization 
accuracy achievable by these schemes is very desirable 
to overcome the challenges posed by the range-based 
localization schemes when applied to sensor networks a different 
approach has been proposed and evaluated in the past this 
approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location 
information from the proximity to a set of known beacon nodes 
bulusu et al propose in a localization scheme called 
centroid in which each node localizes itself to the centroid of its 
proximate beacon nodes in he et al propose apit a scheme 
in which each node decides its position based on the possibility of 
being inside or outside of a triangle formed by any three beacon 
nodes heard by the node the global coordinate system 
developed at mit uses apriori knowledge of the node density in 
the network to estimate the average hop distance the dv- 
family of localization schemes uses the hop count from 
known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the 
distance the majority of range-free localization schemes have 
been evaluated in simulations or controlled environments several 
studies have emphasized the challenges that real 
environments pose langendoen and reijers present a detailed 
comparative study of several localization schemes in 
to the best of our knowledge spotlight is the first range-free 
localization scheme that works very well in an outdoor 
environment our system requires a line of sight between a single 
device and the sensor nodes and the map of the terrain where the 
sensor field is located the spotlight system has a long effective 
range s meters and does not require any infrastructure or 
additional hardware for sensor nodes the spotlight system 
combines the advantages and does not suffer from the 
disadvantages of the two localization classes 
 spotlight system design 
the main idea of the spotlight localization system is to generate 
controlled events in the field where the sensor nodes were 
deployed an event could be for example the presence of light in 
an area using the time when an event is perceived by a sensor 
node and the spatio-temporal properties of the generated events 
spatial information i e location regarding the sensor node can be 
inferred 
figure localization of a sensor network using the 
spotlight system 
we envision and depict in figure a sensor network 
deployment and localization scenario as follows wireless sensor 
nodes are randomly deployed from an unmanned aerial vehicle 
after deployment the sensor nodes self-organize into a network 
and execute a time-synchronization protocol an aerial vehicle 
 e g helicopter equipped with a device called spotlight flies 
over the network and generates light events the sensor nodes 
detect the events and report back to the spotlight device through a 
base station the timestamps when the events were detected the 
spotlight device computes the location of the sensor nodes 
during the design of our spotlight system we made the 
following assumptions 
- the sensor network to be localized is connected and a 
middleware able to forward data from the sensor nodes to the 
spotlight device is present 
- the aerial vehicle has a very good knowledge about its position 
and orientation parameters translation and rigid-body 
rotation and it possesses the map of the field where the network 
was deployed 
- a powerful spotlight device is available and it is able to generate 
 
spatially large events that can be detected by the sensor nodes 
even in the presence of background noise daylight 
- a line of sight between the spotlight device and sensor nodes 
exists 
our assumptions are simplifying assumptions meant to reduce 
the complexity of the presentation for clarity we propose 
solutions that do not rely on these simplifying assumptions in 
section 
in order to formally describe and generalize the spotlight 
localization system we introduce the following definitions 
 definitions and problem formulation 
let s assume that the space a ⊂r 
contains all sensor nodes n 
and that each node ni is positioned at pi x y z to obtain pi x y 
z a spotlight localization system needs to support three main 
functions namely an event distribution function edf e t an 
event detection function d e and a localization function l ti 
they are formally defined as follows 
definition an event e t p is a detectable phenomenon that 
occurs at time t and at point p є a examples of events are light 
heat smoke sound etc let ti ti ti   tin be a set of n 
timestamps of events detected by a node i let t t t   tm 
be the set of m timestamps of events generated in the sensor field 
definition the event detection function d e defines a 
binary detection algorithm for a given event e

figure spotlight system architecture 
as shown in figure the event detection function d e is 
supported by the sensor nodes it is used to determine whether an 
external event happens or not it can be implemented through 
either a simple threshold-based detection algorithm or other 
advanced digital signal processing techniques the event 
distribution e t and localization functions l ti are implemented 
by a spotlight device the localization function is an aggregation 
algorithm which calculates the intersection of multiple sets of 
points the event distribution function e t describes the 
distribution of events over time it is the core of the spotlight 
system and it is much more sophisticated than the other two 
functions due to the fact that e t is realized by the spotlight 
device the hardware requirements for the sensor nodes remain 
minimal 
with the support of these three functions the localization 
process goes as follows 
 a spotlight device distributes events in the space a over a 
period of time 
 during the event distribution sensor nodes record the time 
sequence ti ti ti   tin at which they detect the 
events 
 after the event distribution each sensor node sends the 
detection time sequence back to the spotlight device 
 the spotlight device estimates the location of a sensor 
node i using the time sequence ti and the known e t 
function 
the event distribution function e t is the core technique used 
in the spotlight system and we propose three designs for it these 
designs have different tradeoffs and the cost comparison is 
presented in section 
 point scan event distribution function 
to illustrate the basic functionality of a spotlight system we start 
with a simple sensor system where a set of nodes are placed along 
a straight line a l r the spotlight device generates 
point events e g light spots along this line with constant speed s 
the set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is ti ti 
the event distribution function e t is 
⊂ 
 stpappte ∧∈ 
where t ∈ l s the resulting localization function is 
 sttetl iii 
where d e ti pi true for node i positioned at pi 
the implementation of the event distribution function e t is 
straightforward as shown in figure a when a light source 
emits a beam of light with the angular speed given by

α a light spot event with constant speed s is

figure the implementation of the point scan edf 
the point scan edf can be generalized to the case where nodes 
are placed in a two dimensional plane r 
 in this case the 
spotlight system progressively scans the plane to activate the 
sensor nodes this scenario is depicted in figure b 
 line scan event distribution function 
some devices e g diode lasers can generate an entire line of 
events simultaneously with these devices we can support the 
line scan event distributed function easily we assume that the 
 
sensor nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane a l x 
l ⊂r 
 and that the scanning speed is s the set of timestamps of 
events detected by a node i is ti ti ti 
figure the implementation of the line scan edf 
the line scan edf is defined as follows

we can localize a node by calculating the intersection of the 
two event lines as shown in figure more formally

where d e ti pi true d e ti pi true for node i positioned 
at pi 
 area cover event distribution function 
other devices such as light projectors can generate events that 
cover an area this allows the implementation of the area cover 
edf the idea of area cover edf is to partition the space a into 
multiple sections and assign a unique binary identifier called 
code to each section let s suppose that the localization is done 
within a plane a r 
 each section sk within a has a unique 
code k the area cover edf is then defined as follows

 ` itttiffalsetkbit −∈ 
where cog sk denotes the center of gravity of sk 
we illustrate the area cover edf with a simple example as 
shown in figure the plane a is divided in sections each 
section sk has a unique code k the spotlight device distributes the 
events according to these codes at time j a section sk is covered by 
an event lit by light if jth 
bit of k is a node residing anywhere 
in the section sk is localized at the center of gravity of that section 
for example nodes within section detect the events at time t 
 at t the section where each node resides can be 
determined 
a more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the 
plane hence the number of bits in the code will increase 
considering the noise that is present in a real outdoor 
environment it is easy to observe that a relatively small error in 
detecting the correct bit pattern could result in a large localization 
error returning to the example shown in figure if a sensor node 
is located in the section with code and due to the noise at 
time t it thinks it detected an event it will incorrectly 
conclude that its code is and it positions itself two squares 
below its correct position the localization accuracy can 
deteriorate even further if multiple errors are present in the 
transmission of the code 
a natural solution to this problem is to use error-correcting 
codes which greatly reduce the probability of an error without 
paying the price of a re-transmission or lengthening the 
transmission time too much several error correction schemes have 
been proposed in the past two of the most notable ones are the 
hamming code and the golay code both are 
perfect linear error correcting codes the hamming coding scheme 
can detect up to -bit errors and correct -bit errors in the 
hamming scheme a message having bits of data e g 
dddd where d is a data bit is transmitted as a -bit word by 
adding error control bits e g dddpdpp where p is a parity bit 
figure the steps of area cover edf the events cover 
the shaded areas 
the steps of the area cover technique when using hamming 
 scheme are shown in figure golay codes can detect up to 
 -bit errors and correct up to -bit errors similar to hamming 
 golay constructs a -bit codeword from -bit data golay 
codes have been used in satellite and spacecraft data transmission 
and are most suitable in cases where short codeword lengths are 
desirable 
figure the steps of area cover edf with hamming 
ecc the events cover the shaded areas 
let s assume a -bit error probability of and a -bit 
message that needs to be transmitted the probability of a failed 
transmission is thus if no error detection and correction is 
used for the hamming scheme i e more than -bit error 
and for the golay scheme i e more than -bit errors 
golay is thus times more robust that the hamming scheme 
which is times more robust than the no error correction scheme 
 
considering that a limited number of corrections is possible by 
any coding scheme a natural question arises can we minimize the 
localization error when there are errors that can not be corrected 
this can be achieved by a clever placement of codes in the grid 
as shown in figure the placement a in the presence of a -bit 
error has a smaller average localization error when compared to 
the placement b the objective of our code placement strategy is 
to reduce the total euclidean distance between all pairs of codes 
with hamming distances smaller than k the largest number of 
expected -bit errors 
figure different code placement strategies 
formally a placement is represented by a function p l d 
→ 
c which assigns a code to every coordinate in the d-dimensional 
cube of size l e g in the planar case we place codes in a 
 dimensional grid we denote by de i j the euclidean distance 
and by dh i j the hamming distance between two codes i and j in 
a noisy environment dh i j determines the crossover probability 
between the two codes for the case of independent detections the 
higher dh i j is the lower the crossover probability will be the 
objective function is defined as follows

equation is a non-linear and non-convex programming 
problem in general it is analytically hard to obtain the global 
minimum to overcome this we propose a greedy placement 
method to obtain suboptimal results in this method we initialize 
the -dimensional grid with codes then we swap the codes within 
the grid repeatedly to minimize the objective function for each 
swap we greedily chose a pair of codes which can reduce the 
objective function equation the most the proposed greedy 
placement method ends when no swap of codes can further 
minimize the objective function 
for evaluation we compared the average localization error in 
the presence of k-bit error for two strategies the proposed greedy 
placement and the row-major placement it places the codes

 event distribution function analysis 
although all three aforementioned techniques are able to localize 
the sensor nodes they differ in the localization time 
communication overhead and energy consumed by the event 
distribution function let s call it event overhead let s assume 
that all sensor nodes are located in a square with edge size d and 
that the spotlight device can generate n events e g point line 
and area cover events every second and that the maximum 
tolerable localization error is r table presents the execution cost

table indicates that the event overhead for the point scan 
method is the smallest - it requires a one-time coverage of the area 
hence the d 
 however the point scan takes a much longer time 
than the area cover technique which finishes in logrd seconds 
the line scan method trades the event overhead well with the 
localization time by doubling the event overhead the line scan 
method takes only r d percentage of time to complete when 
compared with the point scan method from table it can be 
observed that the execution costs do not depend on the number of 
sensor nodes to be localized 
it is important to remark the ratio event overhead per unit time 
which is indicative of the power requirement for the spotlight 
device this ratio is constant for the point scan r 
 n while it 
grows linearly with area for the area cover d 
 n if the 
deployment area is very large the use of the area cover edf is 
prohibitively expensive if not impossible for practical purposes 
the area cover is a viable solution for small to medium size 
networks while the line scan works well for large networks we 
discuss the implications of the power requirement for the spotlight 
device and offer a hybrid solution in section 
 localization error analysis 
the accuracy of localization with the spotlight technique depends 
on many aspects the major factors that were considered during 
the implementation of the system are discussed below 
 
- time synchronization the spotlight system exchanges time 
stamps between sensor nodes and the spotlight device it is 
necessary for the system to reach consensus on global time 
through synchronization due to the uncertainty in hardware 
processing and wireless communication we can only confine such 
errors within certain bounds e g one jiffy an imprecise input to 
the localization function l t leads to an error in node 
localization 
- uncertainty in detection the sampling rate of the sensor nodes is 
finite consequently there will be an unpredictable delay between 
the time when an event is truly present and when the sensor node 
detects it lower sampling rates will generate larger localizations 
errors 
- size of the event the events distributed by the spotlight device 
can not be infinitely small if a node detects one event it is hard 
for it to estimate the exact location of itself within the event 
- realization of event distribution function edf defines 
locations of events at time t due to the limited accuracy e g 
mechanical imprecision a spotlight device might generate events 
which locate differently from where these events are supposed to 
be 
it is important to remark that the localization error is 
independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network this 
independence as well as the aforementioned independence of the 
execution cost indicate the very good scalability properties with 
the number of sensor nodes but not with the area of deployment 
that the spotlight system possesses 
 system implementation 
for our performance evaluation we implemented two spotlight 
systems using these two implementations we were able to 
investigate the full spectrum of event distribution techniques 
proposed in section at a reduced one time cost less than 
 
the first implementation called μspotlight had a short range 
 - meters however its capability of generating the entire 
spectrum of edfs made it very useful we used this 
implementation mainly to investigate the capabilities of the 
spotlight system and tune its performance it was not intended to 
represent the full solution but only a scaled down version of the 
system 
the second implementation the spotlight system had a much 
longer range as far as m but it was limited in the types of 
edfs that it can generate the goal of this implementation was to 
show how the spotlight system works in a real outdoor 
environment and show correlations with the experimental results 
obtained from the μspotlight system implementation 
in the remaining part of this section we describe how we 
implemented the three components event distribution event 
detection and localization functions of the spotlight architecture 
and the time synchronization protocol a key component of our 
system 
 µspotlight system 
the first system we built called μspotlight used as the spotlight 
device an infocus ld projector connected to an ibm 
thinkpad laptop the system is shown in figure 
the event distribution function was implemented as a java 
gui due to the stringent timing requirements and the delay 
caused by the buffering in the windowing system of a pc we used 
the full-screen exclusive mode api provided by java this 
allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely 
estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector 
hence a higher accuracy of timestamps of events because of the 
 hz refresh rate of our projector there was still an uncertainty in 
the time stamping of the events of msec we explored the 
possibility of using and modifying the linux kernel to expose the 
vertical synch vsynch interrupt generated by the displaying 
device after each screen refresh out of the kernel mode the 
performance evaluation results showed however that this level of 
accuracy was not needed 
the sensor nodes that we used were berkeley mica motes 
equipped with mts multi-sensor boards from crossbow this 
sensor board contains a cdse photo sensor which can detect the 
light from the projector 
figure μspotlight system implementation 
with this implementation of the spotlight system we were able 
to generate point line and area scan events 
 spotlight system 
the second spotlight system we built used as the spotlight 
device diode lasers a computerized telescope mount celestron 
cg- gt shown in figure and an ibm thinkpad laptop the 
laptop was connected through rs interfaces to the telescope 
mount and to one xsm ca mote acting as a base station 
the diode lasers we used ranged in power from mw to mw 
they emitted at nm close to the point of highest sensitivity for 
cdse photosensor the diode lasers were equipped with lenses that 
allowed us to control the divergence of the beam 
figure spotlight system implementation 
the telescope mount has worm gears for a smooth motion and 
high precision angular measurements the two angular measures 
that we used were the so called alt from altitude and az from 
azimuth in astronomy the altitude of a celestial object is its 
angular distance above or below the celestial horizon and the 
azimuth is the angular distance of an object eastwards of the 
meridian along the horizon 
 
the laptop computer through a java gui controls the motion 
of the telescope mount orienting it such that a full point scan of 
an area is performed similar to the one described in figure b 
for each turning point i the -tuple alti and azi angles and the 
timestamp ti is recorded the spotlight system uses the timestamp 
received from a sensor node j to obtain the angular measures altj 
and azj for its location 
for the sensor nodes we used xsm motes mainly because of 
their longer communication range the xsm mote has the photo 
sensor embedded in its main board we had to make minor 
adjustments to the plastic housing in order to expose the photo 
sensor to the outside the same mote code written in nesc for 
tinyos was used for both µspotlight and spotlight system 
implementations 
 event detection function d t 
the event detection function aims to detect the beginning of an 
event and record the time when the event was observed we 
implemented a very simple detection function based on the 
observed maximum value an event i will be time stamped with 
time ti if the reading from the photo sensor dti fulfills the 
condition 
itdd δ max 
where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor 
before ti and δ is a constant which ensures that the first large 
detection gives the timestamp of the event i e small variations 
around the first large signal are not considered hence δ 
guarantees that only sharp changes in the detected value generate 
an observed event 
 localization function l t 
the localization function is implemented in the java gui it 
matches the timestamps created by the event distribution function 
with those reported by the sensor nodes 
the localization function for the point scan edf has as input 
a time sequence ti t as reported by node i the function 
performs a simple search for the event with a timestamp closest to 
t if t is constrained by 
 
 nn ee ttt 
where en and en are two consecutive events then the obtained 
location for node i is 
 
 
 nn ee yyxx 
the case for the line scan is treated similarly the input to the 
localization function is the time sequence ti t t as reported 
by node i if the reported timestamps are constrained by 
 
 nn ee ttt and 
 
 mm ee ttt 
where en and en are two consecutive events on the horizontal 
scan and em and em are two consecutive events on vertical scan 
then the inferred location for node i is 
 
 
 mn ee yyxx 
the localization function for the area cover edf has as input 
a timestamp set ti ti ti   tin of the n events detected by node 
i we recall the notation for the set of m timestamps of events 
generated by the spotlight device t t t   tm a code 
di di di  dim is then constructed for each node i such that dij if 
tj ∈ti and dij if tj ∉ ti the function performs a search for an 
event with an identical code if the following condition is true 
nei dd 
where en is an event with code den then the inferred location for 
node i is 
nn ee yyxx 
 time synchronization 
the time synchronization in the spotlight system consists of two 
parts 
- synchronization between sensor nodes this is achieved through 
the flooding time synchronization protocol in this protocol 
synchronized nodes the root node is the only synchronized node 
at the beginning send time synchronization message to 
unsynchronized nodes the sender puts the time stamp into the 
synchronization message right before the bytes containing the time 
stamp are transmitted once a receiver gets the message it follows 
the sender s time and performs the necessary calculations to 
compensate for the clock drift 
- synchronization between the sensor nodes and the spotlight 
device we implemented this part through a two-way handshaking 
between the spotlight device and one node used as the base 
station the sensor node is attached to the spotlight device through

figure two-way synchronization 
as shown in figure let s assume that the spotlight device 
sends a synchronization message sync at local time t the 
sensor node receives it at its local time t and acknowledges it at 
local time t both t and t are sent back through ack after 
the spotlight device receives the ack at its local time t the time 
synchronization can be achieved as follows

we note that equation assumes that the one trip delays are 
the same in both directions in practice this does not hold well 
enough to improve the performance we separate the handshaking 
process from the timestamp exchanges the handshaking is done 
fast through a byte exchange between the spotlight device and 
the sensor node the timestamps are still recorded but not sent 
after this fast handshaking the recorded time stamps are 
exchanged the result indicates that this approach can significantly 
improve the accuracy of time synchronization 
 performance evaluation 
in this section we present the performance evaluation of the 
spotlight systems when using the three event distribution 
functions i e point scan line scan and area cover described in 
section 
 
for the µspotlight system we used mica motes the sensor 
nodes were attached to a vertically positioned veltex board by 
projecting the light to the sensor nodes we are able to generate 
well controlled point line and area events the spotlight device 
was able to generate events i e project light patterns covering an 
area of approximate size x cm 
 the screen resolution for 
the projector was x and the movement of the point scan 
and line scan techniques was done through increments in the 
appropriate direction of pixels between events 
each experimental point was obtained from successive runs 
of the localization procedure each set of runs was preceded by 
a calibration phase aimed at estimating the total delays between 
the spotlight device and each sensor node in detecting an event 
during the calibration we created an event covering the entire 
sensor field illuminated the entire area the timestamp reported 
by each sensor node in conjunction with the timestamp created by 
the spotlight device were used to obtain the time offset for each 
sensor node more sophisticated calibration procedures have been 
reported previously in addition to the time offset we added a 
manually configurable parameter called bias it was used to best 
estimate the center of an event 
figure deployment site for the spotlight system 
for the spotlight system evaluation we deployed xsm 
motes in a football field the site is shown in figure laser 
beams are depicted with red arrows and sensor nodes with white 
dots two sets of experiments were run with the spotlight device 
positioned at m and at m from the sensor field the sensor 
nodes were aligned and the spotlight device executed a point 
scan the localization system computed the coordinates of the 
sensor nodes and the spotlight device was oriented through a 
goto command sent to the telescope mount towards the 
computed location in the initial stages of the experiments we 
manually measured the localization error 
for our experimental evaluation the metrics of interest were as 
follows 
- localization error defined as the distance between the real 
location and the one obtained from the spotlight system 
- localization duration defined as the time span between the first 
and last event 
- localization range defined as the maximum distance between 
the spotlight device and the sensor nodes 
- a localization cost function cost localization accuracy 
 localization duration → quantifies the trade-off between 
the accuracy in localization and the localization duration the 
objective is to minimize the localization cost function by 
denoting with ei the localization error for the ith 
scenario with di 
the localization duration for the ith 
scenario with max e the 
maximum localization error with max d the maximum 
localization duration and with α the importance factor the 
localization cost function is formally defined as

- localization bias this metric is used to investigate the 
effectiveness of the calibration procedure if for example all 
computed locations have a bias in the west direction a calibration 
factor can be used to compensate for the difference 
the parameters that we varied during the performance 
evaluation of our system were the type of scanning point line 
and area the size of the event the duration of the event for area 
cover the scanning speed the power of the laser and the distance 
between the spotlight device and sensor field to estimate the 
range of the system 
 point scan - μspotlight system 
in this experiment we investigated how the size of the event and 
the scanning speed affect the localization error figure shows 
the mean localization errors with their standard deviations 
it can be observed that while the scanning speed varying 
between cm sec and cm sec has a minor influence on the 
localization accuracy the size of the event has a dramatic effect

figure localization error vs event size for the point

the obtained localization error varied from as little as cm to 
over cm for the largest event this dependence can be explained 
by our event detection algorithm the first detection above a 
threshold gave the timestamp for the event 
the duration of the localization scheme is shown in figure 
the dependency of the localization duration on the size of the 
event and scanning speed is natural a bigger event allows a 
reduction in the total duration of up to the localization 
duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed as 
expected and depicted in figure

an interesting trade-off is between the localization accuracy 
 usually the most important factor and the localization time 
 important in environments where stealthiness is paramount 
figure shows the localization cost function for α 
 accuracy and duration are equally important 
as shown in figure it can be observed that an event size of 
approximately - cm depending on the scanning speed 
minimizes our cost function for α the same graph would be a 
monotonically increasing function while for α it would be 
monotonically decreasing function

 line scan - μspotlight system 
in a similar manner to the point scan edf for the line scan edf 
we were interested in the dependency of the localization error and 
duration on the size of the event and scanning speed 
we represent in figure the localization error for different 
event sizes it is interesting to observe the dependency concave 
shape of the localization error vs the event size moreover a 
question that should arise is why the same dependency was not 
observed in the case of point scan edf

figure localization error vs event size for the line

the explanation for this concave dependency is the existence of 
a bias in location estimation as a reminder a bias factor was 
introduced in order to best estimate the central point of events that 
have a large size what figure shows is the fact that the bias 
factor was optimal for an event size of approximately cm for 
events smaller and larger than this the bias factor was too large 
and too small respectively thus it introduced biased errors in the 
position estimation 
the reason why we did not observe the same dependency in the 
case of the point scan edf was that we did not experiment with 
event sizes below cm due to the long time it would have taken to 
scan the entire field with events as small as cm 
the results for the localization duration as a function of the size 
of the event are shown in figure as shown the localization 
duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed the size of 
the event has a smaller influence on the localization duration one 
can remark the average localization duration of about sec much 
shorter then the duration obtained in the point scan experiment 
the localization cost function dependency on the event size 
and scanning speed for α is shown in figure the 
dependency on the scanning speed is very small the cost function 
achieves a minimum in the same - cm range it is interesting to 
note that this - cm optimal event size is smaller than the one 
observed in the case of point scan edf the explanation for this is 
that the smaller localization duration observed in the line scan 
edf allowed a shift towards smaller event sizes in the total 
localization cost function

figure cost function vs event size for the line scan 
edf 
during our experiments with the line scan edf we observed 
evidence of a bias in location estimation the estimated locations 
for all sensor nodes exhibited different biases for different event 
sizes for example for an event size of cm the estimated 
location for sensor nodes was to the upper-left size of the actual 
location this was equivalent to an early detection since our 
scanning was done from left to right and from top to bottom the 
scanning speed did not influence the bias 
in order to better understand the observed phenomena we 
analyzed our data figure shows the bias in the horizontal 
direction for different event sizes the vertical bias was almost 
identical and we omit it due to space constraints 
from figure one can observe that the smallest observed 
bias and hence the most accurate positioning was for an event of 
size cm these results are consistent with the observed 
localization error shown in figure 
we also adjusted the measured localization error shown in 
figure for the observed bias shown in figure the results 
of an ideal case of spotlight localization system with line scan 
edf are shown in figure the errors are remarkably small 
varying between cm and cm with a general trend of higher 
localization errors for larger event sizes

 area cover - μspotlight system 
in this experiment we investigated how the number of bits used to 
quantify the entire sensor field affected the localization accuracy 
in our first experiment we did not use error correcting codes the 
results are shown in figure

figure localization error vs event size for the area

one can observe a remarkable accuracy with localization error 
on the order of - cm what is important to observe is the 
variance in the localization error in the scenario where bits 
were used while the average error was very small there were a 
couple of cases where an incorrect event detection generated a 
larger than expected error an example of how this error can occur 
was described in section the experimental results presented 
in figure emphasize the need for error correction of the bit 
patterns observed and reported by the sensor nodes 
the localization duration results are shown in figure it can 
be observed that the duration is directly proportional with the 
number of bits used with total durations ranging from sec for the 
least accurate method to - sec for the most accurate the 
duration of an event had a small influence on the total localization 
time when considering the same scenario same number of bits for 
the code 
the cost function dependency on the number of bits in the 
code for α is shown in figure generally since the 
localization duration for the area scan can be extremely small a 
higher accuracy in the localization is desired while the cost 
function achieves a minimum when bits are used we attribute 
the slight increase observed when bits were used to the two 
 bit scenarios where larger than the expected errors were observed 
namely - mm as shown in figure

is simply the same -bit code scenario shown in figure we

 point scan - spotlight system 
in this section we describe the experiments performed at a football 
stadium using our spotlight system the hardware that we had 
available allowed us to evaluate the point scan technique of the 
spotlight system in our evaluation we were interested to see the 
performance of the system at different ranges figures and 
show the localization error versus the event size at two different 
ranges m and m 
figure shows a remarkable accuracy in localization the 
errors are in the centimeter range our initial manual 
measurements of the localization error were most of the time 
difficult to make since the spot of the laser was almost perfectly 
covering the xsm mote we are able to achieve localization errors 
of a few centimeters which only range-based localization schemes 
are able to achieve the observed dependency on the size of 
the event is similar to the one observed in the μspotlight system 
evaluation and shown in figure this proved that the 
μspotlight system is a viable alternative for investigating complex 
edfs without incurring the costs for the necessary hardware

figure localization error vs event size for spotlight

in the experiments performed over a much longer distance 
between the spotlight device and sensor network the average 
localization error remains very small localization errors of 
 cm were measured as figure shows we were simply 
amazed by the accuracy that the system is capable of when 
considering that the spotlight system operated over the length of a 
football stadium throughout our experimentation with the 
spotlight system we have observed localization errors that were 
simply offsets of real locations since the same phenomenon was 
observed when experimenting with the μspotlight system we 
believe that with auto-calibration the localization error can be 
further reduced

the time required for localization using the spotlight system 
with a point scan edf is given by t l l s es where l and l 
are the dimensions of the sensor network field s is the scanning 
speed and es is the size of the event figure shows the time for 
localizing a sensor network deployed in an area of size of a 
football field using the spotlight system here we ignore the 
message propagation time from the sensor nodes to the spotlight 
device 
from figure it can be observed that the very small 
localization errors are prohibitively expensive in the case of the 
point scan when localization errors of up to m are tolerable 
localization duration can be as low as minutes localization 
durations of - minutes and localization errors of m are 
currently state of art in the realm of range-free localization 
schemes and these results are achieved by using the point scan 
scheme which required the highest localization time as it was 
shown in table

figure localization time vs event size for spotlight 
system 
one important characteristic of the spotlight system is its range 
the two most important factors are the sensitivity of the 
photosensor and the power of the spotlight source we were 
interested in measuring the range of our spotlight system 
considering our capabilities mts sensor board and 
inexpensive - diode laser as a result we measured the 
intensity of the laser beam having the same focus at different 
distances the results are shown in figure

intensity adccount

 mw 
figure localization range for the spotlight system 
from figure it can be observed that only a minor decrease 
in the intensity occurs due to absorption and possibly our 
imperfect focusing of the laser beam a linear fit of the 
experimental data shows that distances of up to m can be 
achieved while we do not expect atmospheric conditions over 
large distances to be similar to our m evaluation there is 
strong evidence that distances i e altitude of - m can 
easily be achieved the angle between the laser beam and the 
vertical should be minimized less than ° as it reduces the 
difference between the beam cross-section event size and the 
actual projection of the beam on the ground 
in a similar manner we were interested in finding out the 
maximum size of an event that can be generated by a cots laser 
and that is detectable by the existing photosensor for this we 
 
varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light 
intensity as given by the adc count the results are shown in 
figure it can be observed that for the less powerful laser an 
event size of m is the limit for the more powerful laser the 
event size can be as high as m 
through our extensive performance evaluation results we have 
shown that the spotlight system is a feasible highly accurate low 
cost solution for localization of wireless sensor networks from 
our experience with sources of laser radiation we believe that for 
small and medium size sensor network deployments in areas of 
less than m 
 the area cover scheme is a viable solution 
for large size sensor network deployments the line scan or an 
incremental use of the area cover are very good options

 optimizations lessons learned 
 distributed spotlight system 
the proposed design and the implementation of the spotlight 
system can be considered centralized due to the gathering of the 
sensor data and the execution of the localization function l t by 
the spotlight device we show that this design can easily be 
transformed into a distributed one by offering two solutions 
one idea is to disseminate in the network information about the 
path of events generated by the edf similar to an equation 
describing a path and let the sensor nodes execute the 
localization function for example in the line scan scenario if 
the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans 
and the times they were reached are propagated in the network 
then any sensor in the network can obtain its location assuming a 
constant scanning speed 
a second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their 
positions in the case of line scan if three anchors are present 
after detecting the presence of the two events the anchors flood 
the network with their locations and times of detection using the 
same simple formulas as in the previous scheme all sensor nodes 
can infer their positions 
 localization overhead reduction 
another requirement imposed by the spotlight system design is 
the use of a time synchronization protocol between the spotlight 
device and the sensor network relaxing this requirement and 
imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor 
nodes is a very desirable objective the idea is to use the 
knowledge that the spotlight device has about the speed with 
which the scanning of the sensor field takes place if the scanning 
speed is constant let s call it s then the time difference let s call 
it δt between the event detections of two sensor nodes is in fact 
an accurate measure of the range between them d s δt hence 
the spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the 
distance between any pair of sensor nodes an important 
observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from 
limitations of others small range and directionality for ultrasound 
or irregularity fading and multipath for received signal strength 
indicator rssi after the ranges between nodes have been 
determined either in a centralized or distributed manner graph 
embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid 
graph describing the sensor network topology 
 dynamic event distribution function e t 
another system optimization is for environments where the sensor 
node density is not uniform one disadvantage of the line scan 
technique when compared to the area cover is the localization 
time 
an idea is to use two scans one which uses a large event size 
 hence larger localization errors followed by a second scan in 
which the event size changes dynamically the first scan is used 
for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes the 
second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node 
density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor 
node density 
a dynamic edf can also be used when it is very difficult to 
meet the power requirements for the spotlight device imposed by 
the use of the area cover scheme in a very large area in this 
scenario a hybrid scheme can be used the first scan point scan 
is performed quickly with a very large event size and it is meant 
to identify roughly the location of the sensor network 
subsequent area cover scans will be executed on smaller portions 
of the network until the entire deployment area is localized 
 stealthiness 
our implementation of the spotlight system used visible light 
for creating events using the system during the daylight or in a 
room well lit poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp 
radiation which generate a strong background noise the 
alternative which we used in our performance evaluations was to 
use the system in a dark room μspotlight system or during the 
night spotlight system while using the spotlight system during 
the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is 
not important e g environmental sciences for others e g 
military applications divulging the presence and location of a 
sensor field could seriously compromise the efficacy of the 
system 
figure fluorescent light spectra top spectral 
response for cdse cells bottom 
a solution to this problem which we experimented with in the 
µspotlight system was to use an optical filter on top of the light 
 
sensor the spectral response of a cdse photo sensor spans almost 
the entire visible domain with a peak at about nm figure 
 -bottom as shown in figure -top the fluorescent light has 
no significant components above nm hence a simple red filter 
 schott rg- which transmits all light with wavelength 
approximately above nm coupled with an event distribution 
function that generates events with wavelengths above the same 
threshold would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent 
light is present 
a solution for the spotlight system to be stealthy at night is to 
use a source of infra-red radiation i e laser emitting in the range 
 nm for a daylight use of the spotlight system the 
challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural 
light a solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band 
optical filter centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation the 
feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be 
proven 
 network deployed in unknown terrain 
a further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the 
sensor network was deployed is unknown while this is highly 
unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network 
technologies it is not difficult to imagine military applications 
where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown 
terrain a solution to this problem is a system that uses two 
spotlight devices or equivalently the use of the same device from 
two distinct positions executing from each of them a complete 
localization procedure in this scheme the position of the sensor 
node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location 
directions obtained by the system the relative localization for 
each pair of spotlight devices will require an accurate knowledge 
of the translation and rigid-body rotation parameters for 
spotlight s position and orientation as mentioned in section 
this generalization is also applicable to scenarios where due to 
terrain variations there is no single aerial point with a direct line 
of sight to all sensor nodes e g hilly terrain by executing the 
localization procedure from different aerial points the probability 
of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes increases for 
some military scenarios where open terrain is prevalent 
the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor in light of 
this the spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor 
environments 
 conclusions and future work 
in this paper we presented the design implementation and 
evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks 
called spotlight our localization solution does not require any 
additional hardware for the sensor nodes other than what already 
exists all the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a 
single spotlight device our localization system is reusable i e the 
costs can be amortized through several deployments and its 
performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the 
network our experimental results obtained from a real system 
deployed outdoors show that the localization error is less than 
 cm this error is currently state of art even for range-based 
localization systems and it is smaller than the error obtained 
when using gps devices or when the manual deployment of sensor 
nodes is a feasible option 
as future work we would like to explore the self-calibration 
and self-tuning of the spotlight system the accuracy of the 
system can be further improved if the distribution of the event 
instead of a single timestamp is reported a generalization could 
be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation 
problem that provides the building blocks for more general 
localization techniques
