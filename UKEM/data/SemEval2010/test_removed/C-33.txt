abstract 
how to provide appropriate context information is a 
challenging problem in context-aware computing most existing 
approaches use a centralized selection mechanism to decide 
which context information is appropriate in this paper we 
propose a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards 
to solving such problem distributed context providers 
negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context 
and how they allocate proceeds in order to support our 
approach we have designed a concrete negotiation model 
with rewards we also evaluate our approach and show that 
it indeed can choose an appropriate context provider and 
allocate the proceeds fairly

 introduction 
context-awareness is a key concept in pervasive 
computing context informs both recognition and mapping by 
providing a structured unified view of the world in which the 
system operates context-aware applications exploit 
context information such as location preferences of users and 
so on to adapt their behaviors in response to changing 
requirements of users and pervasive environments however 
one specific kind of context can often be provided by 
different context providers sensors or other data sources of 
context information with different quality levels for example 
in a smart home thermometer a s measurement precision 
is ◦ 
c and thermometer b s measurement precision is 
 ◦ 
c thus a could provide more precise context 
information about temperature than b moreover sometimes 
different context providers may provide conflictive context 
information for example different sensors report that the 
same person is in different places at the same time 
because context-aware applications utilize context information 
to adapt their behaviors inappropriate context information 
may lead to inappropriate behavior thus we should design 
a mechanism to provide appropriate context information for 
current context-aware applications 
in pervasive environments context providers considered 
as relatively independent entities have their own interests 
they hope to get proceeds when they provide context 
information however most existing approaches consider context 
providers as entities without any personal interests and use 
a centralized arbitrator provided by the middleware to 
decide who can provide appropriate context thus the burden 
of the middleware is very heavy and its decision may be 
unfair and harm some providers interests moreover when 
such arbitrator is broken down it will cause serious 
consequences for context-aware applications in this paper we 
let distributed context providers themselves decide who 
provide context information since high reputation could help 
providers get more opportunities to provide context and get 
more proceeds in the future providers try to get the right 
to provide good context to enhance their reputation in 
order to get such right context providers may agree to share 
some portion of the proceeds with its opponents thus 
context providers negotiate with each other to reach agreement 
on the issues who can provide context and how they allocate 
the proceeds our approach has some specific advantages 
 we do not need an arbitrator provided by the 
middleware of pervasive computing to decide who provides 
context thus it will reduce the burden of the 
middleware 
 it is more reasonable that distributed context providers 
decide who provide context because it can avoid the 
serious consequences caused by a breakdown of a 
centralized arbitrator 
 it can guarantee providers interests and provide fair 
proceeds allocation when providers negotiate with each 
other to reach agreement on their concerned problems 
 this approach can choose an appropriate provider 
automatically it does not need any applications and 
users intervention 
the negotiation model we have designed to support our 
approach is also a novel model in negotiation domain this 
model can help negotiators reach agreement in the present 
negotiation process by providing some guarantees over the 
outcome of next negotiation process i e rewards 
negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than 
counter-offer which will delay the agreement and accepts 
current offer and reward without the reward it may find 
current offer worth less than the counter-offer and proposes 
its counter-offer it will cost more time to reach agreement 
it also expands the negotiation space considered in present 
negotiation process and therefore provides more 
possibilities to find better agreement 
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows 
section presents some assumptions section describes our 
approach based on negotiation detailedly including 
utility functions negotiation protocol and context providers 
strategies section evaluates our approach in section 
we introduce some related work and conclude in section 
 some assumptions 
before introducing our approach we would like to give 
some assumptions 
 all context providers are well-meaning and honest 
during the negotiation process they exchange 
information honestly rewards confirmed in this 
negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation 
process 
 all providers must guarantee the system s interests 
they should provide appropriate context information 
for current applications after guaranteeing the 
system s interest they can try to maximize their own 
personal interests the assumption is reasonable because 
when an inappropriate context provider gets the right 
to provide bad context as a punishment its 
reputation will decrease and the proceeds is also very small 
 as context providers are independent factors which 
influence their negotiation stance and behavior are 
private and not available to their opponents their utility 
functions are also private 
 since the negotiation takes place in pervasive 
environments time is a critical factors the current 
application often hopes to get context information as quickly 
as possible so the time cost to reach agreement should 
be as short as possible context providers often have 
strict deadline by when the negotiation must be 
completed 
after presenting these assumptions we will propose our 
approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next 
section 
 our approach 
in the beginning we introduce the concepts of reputation 
and quality of context qoc attributes both will be used 
in our approach reputation of an agent is a perception 
regarding its behavior norms which is held by other agents 
based on experiences and observation of its past actions 
here agent means context provider each provider s 
reputation indicates its historical ability to provide appropriate 
context information quality of context qoc attributes 
characterize the quality of context information when 
applications require context information they should specify 
their qoc requirements which express constraints of qoc 
attributes context providers can specify qoc attributes 
for the context information they deliver although we can 
decide who provides appropriate context according to qoc 
requirements and context providers qoc information 
applications qoc requirements might not reflect the actual 
quality requirements thus in addition to qoc reputation 
information of context providers is another factor affecting 
the decision who can provide context information 
negotiation is a process by which a joint decision is made 
by two or more parties the parties first verbalize 
contradictory demands and then move towards agreement by a 
process of concession making or search for new alternatives 
in pervasive environments all available context providers 
negotiate with each other to decide who can provide 
context information this process will be repeated because a 
kind of context is needed more than one time 
negotiation using persuasive arguments such as threats promises 
of future rewards and appeals allows negotiation parties 
to influence each others preferences to reach better deals 
effectively and efficiently this pervasive negotiation is 
effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be 
constructed to directly impact future encounters in this 
paper for simplicity we let negotiation take place between 
two providers we extend raiffa s basic model for bilateral 
negotiation and allow negotiators to negotiate with each 
other by exchanging arguments in the form of promises of 
future rewards or requests for future rewards rewards mean 
some extra proceeds in the next negotiation process they 
can influence outcomes of current and future negotiation 
in our approach as described by figure the current 
application requires context manager to provide a specific 
type of context information satisfying qoc requirements 
context manager finds that provider a and b can provide 
such kind of context with different quality levels then the 
manager tells a and b to negotiate to reach agreement on 
who can provide the context information and how they will 
allocate the proceeds both providers get reputation 
information from the database reputation of context providers 
and qoc requirements and then negotiate with each other 
according to our negotiation model when negotiation is 
completed the chosen provider will provide the context 
information to context manager and then context manager 
delivers such information to the application and also stores 
it in context knowledge base where current and historical 
context information is stored the current application gives 
the feedback information about the provided context and 
then context manager will update the chosen provider s 
reputation information according to the feedback information 
context manager also provides the proceeds to providers 
according to the feedback information and the time cost 
on negotiation in the following parts of this section we

 utility function 
during the negotiation process one provider proposes an 
offer and a reward to the other provider an offer is noted 
as o c p c indicates the chosen context provider and its 
domain is dc i e the two context providers participating 
in the negotiation p means the proposer s portion of the 
proceeds and its domain is dp its opponent s 
portion of the proceeds is −p the reward ep s domain is dep 
 - and ep means the extra portion of proceeds the 
proposer promises to provide or requests in the next 
negotiation process ep means the proposer promises to provide 
reward ep means the proposer requests reward and ep 
 means no reward the opponent evaluates the offer and 
reward to decide to accept them or propose a counter-offer 
and a reward thus context providers should have utility 
functions to evaluate offers and rewards 
time is a critical factor and only at times in the set 
t tdeadline context providers can propose 
their offers the set o include all available offers 
context provider a s utility function of the offer and reward at 
time t ua 
 o × dep × t → − is defined as 
ua o ep t wa 
 ·ua 
c c wa 
 ·ua 
p p wa

ep ep ·δa t 
similarly the utility function of a s opponent i e b can 
be defined as 
ub o ep t wb

c c wb 
 ·ub 
p −p wb

ep −ep ·δb t 
in wa 
 wa 
 and wa 
 are weights given to c p and ep 
respectively and wa 
 wa 
 wa 
 usually the context 
provider pays the most attention to the system s interests 
pays the least attention to the reward thus wa 
 wa 
 wa 
 
ua 
c dc → − is the utility function of the issue who 
provides context this function is determined by two 
factors the distance between c s qoc and current application s 
qoc requirements and c s reputation the two 
negotiators acquire c s qoc information from c and we use the 
approach proposed in to calculate the distance between 
c s qoc and the application s qoc requirements the 
required context has n qoc attributes and let the 
application s wishes for this context be a a a an where 
ai means the application s indifference to the i-th qoc 
attribute c s qoc attributes cp cp cp cpn where 
cpi means c s inability to provide a quantitative value 
for the i-th qoc attribute because numerical distance 
values of different properties are combined e g location 
precision in metres with refresh rate in hz thus a standard scale 
for all dimension is needed the scaling factors for the qoc 
attributes are s s s sn in addition different qoc 
attributes may have different weights w w w wn 
then d d d dn 
di cpi − ai · si · wi 
where cpi−ai for ai and cpi−ai o ai for cpi 
 o determines the application s satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction when c is unable to provide an estimate of a qoc 
attribute given the value wished for by the application the 
distance can be linear distance -norm euclidean distance 
 -norm or the maximum distance max-norm 
 d d d dn − norm 
 d d d dn − norm 
 d ∞ max d d dn max − norm 
the detail description of this calculation can be found in 
reputation of c can be acquired from the database 
reputation of context providers ua 
c c r × drep → − can 
be defined as 
ua 
c c wa 
c · ua 
d d wa 
c · ua 
rep rep 
wa 
c and wa 
c are weights given to the distance and 
reputation respectively and wa 
c wa 
c drep is the domain 
of reputation information ua 
d r → is a 
monotonedecreasing function and ua 
rep drep → − is a 
monotoneincreasing function ua 
p dp → is the utility function 
of the portion of proceeds a will receive and it is also a 
monotone-increasing function a s utility function of reward 
ep ua 
ep dep → − is also a monotone-increasing 
function and ua 
ep δa t → is the time discount 
function it is also a monotone-decreasing function when 
time t cost on negotiation increases δa t will decrease and 
the utility will also decrease thus both negotiators want 
to reach agreement as quickly as possible to avoid loss of 
utility 
 negotiation protocol 
when provider a and b have got qoc requirements and 
reputation information they begin to negotiate they first 
set their reserved the lowest acceptable utility which can 
guarantee the system s interests and their personal 
interests when the context provider finds the utility of an offer 
and a reward is lower than its reserved utility it will reject 
this proposal and terminate the negotiation process the 
provider who starts the negotiation is chosen randomly we 
assume a starts the negotiation and it proposes offer o and 
reward ep to b according to its strategy see subsection 
when b receives the proposal from a it uses its utility 
function to evaluate it if it is lower than its reserved utility the 
provider terminates the negotiation otherwise if 
ub o ep t ≥ ub o ep t 
i e the utility of o and ep proposed by a at time t is greater 
than the utility of offer o and reward ep which b will 
propose to a at time t b will accept this offer and reward 
the negotiation is completed however if 
ub o ep t ub o ep t 
then b will reject a s proposal and propose its counter-offer 
and reward to a when a receives b s counter-offer and 
reward a evaluates them using its utility function and 
compares the utility with the utility of offer and reward it wants 
to propose to b at time t decides to accept it or give its 
counter-offer and reward this negotiation process continues 
and in each negotiation round context providers concede in 
order to reach agreement the negotiation will be 
successfully finished when agreement is reached or be terminated 
forcibly due to deadline or the utility lower than reserved 
utility when negotiation is forced to be terminated 
context manager will ask a and b to calculate ua 
c a ua 
c b 
ub 
c a and ub 
c b respectively if 
ua 
c a ub 
c a ua 
c b ub 
c b 
context manager let a provide context if 
ua 
c a ub 
c a ua 
c b ub 
c b 
then b will get the right to provide context information 
when 
ua 
c a ub 
c a ua 
c b ub 
c b 
context manager will select a provider from a and b 
randomly in addition context manager allocates the 
proceeds between the two providers although we can select 
one provider when negotiation is terminated forcibly 
however this may lead to the unfair allocation of the proceeds 
moreover more time negotiators cost on negotiation less 
proceeds will be given thus negotiators will try to reach 
agreement as soon as possible in order to avoid unnecessary 
loss 
when the negotiation is finished the chosen provider 
provides the context information to context manager which 
will deliver the information to current application 
according to the application s feedback information about this 
context context manager updates the provider s reputation 
stored in reputation of context providers the provider s 
reputation may be enhanced or decreased in addition 
according to the feedback and the negotiation time 
context manager will give proceeds to the provider then the 
provider will share the proceeds with its opponent according 
to the negotiation outcome and the reward confirmed in the 
last negotiation process for example in the last 
negotiation process a promised to give reward ep ≤ ep to 
b and a s portion of the proceeds is p in current 
negotiation then a s actual portion of the proceeds is p · − ep 
and its opponent b s portion of the proceeds is −p p·ep 
 negotiation strategy 
the context provider might want to pursue the right to 
provide context information blindly in order to enhance its 
reputation however when it finally provides bad context 
information its reputation will be decreased and the 
proceeds is also very small thus the context provider should 
take action according to its strategy the aim of provider s 
negotiation strategy is to determine the best course of action 
which will result in a negotiation outcome maximizing its 
utility function i e how to generate an offer and a reward 
in our negotiation model the context provider generates its 
offer and reward according to its pervious offer and reward 
and the last one sent by its opponent 
at the beginning of the negotiation context providers 
initialize their offers and rewards according to their beliefs and 
their reserved utility if context provider a considers that 
it can provide good context and wants to enhance 
reputation then it will propose that a provides the context 
information shares some proceeds with its opponent b and 
even promises to give reward however if a considers that 
it may provide bad context a will propose that its 
opponent b provide the context and require b to share some 
proceeds and provide reward 
during the negotiation process we assume that at time t 
a proposes offer ot and reward ept to b at time t b 
proposes counter-offer ot and reward ept to a then at 
time t when the utility of b s proposal is greater than 
a s reserved utility a gives its response now we calculate 
the expected utility to be conceded at time t we use cu 
to express the conceded utility 
cu ua ot ept t − ua ot ept t · ca t 
 ua ot ept t ua ot ept t otherwise a will 
accept b s proposal where ca t → is a 
monotoneincreasing function ca t indicates a s utility concession 
rate 
 a concedes a little in the beginning before conceding 
significantly towards the deadline then a generates its 
offer ot ct pt and reward ept at time t the 
expected utility of a at time t is 
ua ot ept t ua ot ept t − cu 
if 
ua ot ept t ≤ ua ot ept t 
then a will accept b s proposal i e ot and ept 
otherwise a will propose its counter-offer and reward based on 
cu we assume that cu is distributed evenly on c p and 
ep i e the utility to be conceded on c p and ep is 
 
cu 
respectively if 
 ua 
c ct − ua 
c ct − 
 
 
cu 
δa t

c ct − ua 
c ct −

δa t 
 
i e the expected utility of c at time t is ua 
c ct − 
 
 
cu 
δa t 
and it is closer to the utility of a s proposal ct at time t 
then at time t ct ct else the utility is closer to 
b proposal ct and ct ct when ct is equal to ct 
the actual conceded utility of c is and the total concession 
of p and ep is cu we divide the total concession of p and ep 
evenly and get the conceded utility of p and ep respectively 
we calculate pt and ept as follows 
pt ua 
p − 
 ua 
p pt − 
 
 
cu 
δa t 
 
ept ua 
ep − 
 ua 
ep ept − 
 
 
cu

when ct is equal to ct the actual conceded utility of c 
is ua 
c ct − ua 
c ct the total concession of p and ep is 
cu 
δa t 
− ua 
c ct − ua 
c ct then

in this section we evaluate the effectiveness of our 
approach by simulated experiments context providers a and 
b negotiate to reach agreement they get qoc requirements 
and calculate the distance between qoc requirements and 
their qoc for simplicity in our experiments we assume 
that the distance has been calculated and da represents 
distance between qoc requirements and a s qoc db 
represents distance between qoc requirements and b s qoc 
the domain of da and db is we assume 
reputation value is a real number and its domain is - 
repa represents a s reputation value and repb represents 
b s reputation value we assume that both providers pay 
the most attention to the system s interests and pay the 
least attention to the reward thus w w w and the 
weight of ud approximates the weight of urep a and b s 
utility functions and weights of c p and ep are defined in 
table we set deadline tdeadline and define time 
discount function δ t and concession rate function c t of a

given different values of da db repa and repb a and 
b negotiate to reach agreement the provider that starts 
the negotiation is chosen at random we hope that when 
da db and repa repb a will get the right to 
provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds and 
when ∆d da − db is in a small range e g - and 
∆rep repa − repb is in a small range e g - a 
and b will get approximately equal opportunities to provide 
context and allocate the proceeds evenly when da−db 
 
 
approximates to da−db 
 
 i e the two providers abilities to 
provide context information are approximately equal we 
also hope that a and b get equal opportunities to provide 
context and allocate the proceeds evenly 
according to the three situations above we make three 
experiments as follows 
experiment in this experiment a and b negotiate 
with each other for times and at each time we assign 
different values to da db repa repb satisfying da db and 
repa repb and the reserved utilities of a and b when 
the experiment is completed we find negotiation games 
are terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved 
utility a gets the right to provide context for times 
the average portion of proceeds a get is about and 
b s average portion of proceeds is the average time 
cost to reach agreement is we also find that when b 
asks a to provide context in its first offer b can require and 
get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill 
experiment a and b also negotiate with each other 
for times in this experiment given different values of da 
db repa repb satisfying − ≤ ∆d da − db ≤ and 
− ≤ ∆rep drep −drep ≤ and the reserved utilities of 
a and b after the experiment we find that there are 
negotiation games terminated due to the utility lower than the 
reserved utility a and b get the right to provide context 
for times and times respectively the average portion 
of proceeds a get is and b s average portion of the 
proceeds is the average time cost on negotiation is 
 
experiment in this experiment a and b also 
negotiate with each other for times given da db repa repb 
 satisfying − ≤ da−db 
 
− da−db 
 
≤ and the reserved 
utilities of a and b there are negotiation games 
terminated forcibly a and b get the right to provide context 
for times and times respectively the average portion 
of proceeds a get is and b s average portion of the 
proceeds is the average time cost on negotiation is 
 
one thing should be mentioned is that except for d rep 
p and ep other factors e g weights time discount 
function δ t and concession rate function c t could also affect 
the negotiation outcome these factors should be adjusted 
according to providers beliefs at the beginning of each 
negotiation process in our experiments for similarity we assign 
values to them without any particularity in advance these 
experiments results prove that our approach can choose an 
appropriate context provider and can provide a relatively 
fair proceeds allocation when one provider is obviously 
more appropriate than the other provider the provider will 
get the right to provide context and get a major portion of 
the proceeds when both providers have the approximately 
same abilities to provide context their opportunities to 
provide context are equal and they can get about a half portion 
of the proceeds respectively 
 related work 
in huebscher and mccann have proposed an adaptive 
middleware design for context-aware applications their 
adaptive middleware uses utility functions to choose the best 
context provider given the qoc requirements of 
applications and the qoc of alternative means of context 
acquisition in our negotiation model the calculation of utility 
function uc was inspired by this approach henricksen and 
indulska propose an approach to modelling and using 
imperfect information in they characterize various types and 
sources of imperfect context information and present a set of 
novel context modelling constructs they also outline a 
software infrastructure that supports the management and use 
of imperfect context information judd and steenkiste in 
describe a generic interface to query context services 
allowing clients to specify their quality requirements as bounds 
on accuracy confidence update time and sample interval 
in lei et al present a context service which accepts 
freshness and confidence meta-data from context sources 
and passes this along to clients so that they can adjust their 
level of trust accordingly presents a framework for 
realizing dynamic context consistency management the 
framework supports inconsistency detection based on a semantic 
matching and inconsistency triggering model and 
inconsistency resolution with proactive actions to context sources 
most approaches to provide appropriate context utilize a 
centralized arbitrator in our approach we let distributed 
context providers themselves decide who can provide 
appropriate context information our approach can reduce the 
burden of the middleware because we do not need the 
middleware to provide a context selection mechanism it can 
avoid the serious consequences caused by a breakdown of 
the arbitrator also it can guarantee context providers 
interests 
 conclusion and future work 
how to provide the appropriate context information is a 
challenging problem in pervasive computing in this paper 
we have presented a novel approach based on negotiation 
with rewards to attempt to solve such problem distributed 
context providers negotiate with each other to reach 
agreement on the issues who can provide the appropriate 
context and how they allocate the proceeds the results of 
our experiments have showed that our approach can choose 
an appropriate context provider and also can guarantee 
providers interests by a relatively fair proceeds allocation 
in this paper we only consider how to choose an 
appropriate context provider from two providers in the future 
work this negotiation model will be extended and more 
than two context providers can negotiate with each other to 
decide who is the most appropriate context provider in the 
extended negotiation model how to design efficient 
negotiation strategies will be a challenging problem we assume 
that the context provider will fulfill its promise of reward in 
the next negotiation process in fact the context provider 
might deceive its opponent and provide illusive promise we 
should solve this problem in the future we also should deal 
with interactions which are interrupted by failing 
communication links in the future work
