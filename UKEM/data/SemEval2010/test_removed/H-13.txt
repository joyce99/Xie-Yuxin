abstract 
web search engines present lists of captions comprising 
title snippet and url to help users decide which search 
results to visit understanding the influence of features of 
these captions on web search behavior may help validate 
algorithms and guidelines for their improved generation in 
this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough 
logs from a commercial search engine to study user behavior 
when interacting with search result captions the findings 
of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features 
such as the presence of all terms query terms the 
readability of the snippet and the length of the url shown in the 
caption can significantly influence users web search

 introduction 
the major commercial web search engines all present 
their results in much the same way each search result is 
described by a brief caption comprising the url of the 
associated web page a title and a brief summary or 
snippet describing the contents of the page often the snippet 
is extracted from the web page itself but it may also be 
taken from external sources such as the human-generated 
summaries found in web directories 
figure shows a typical web search with captions for the 
top three results while the three captions share the same 
basic structure their content differs in several respects the 
snippet of the third caption is nearly twice as long as that 
of the first while the snippet is missing entirely from the 
second caption the title of the third caption contains all 
of the query terms in order while the titles of the first and 
second captions contain only two of the three terms one of 
the query terms is repeated in the first caption all of the 
query terms appear in the url of the third caption while 
none appear in the url of the first caption the snippet 
of the first caption consists of a complete sentence that 
concisely describes the associated page while the snippet of the 
third caption consists of two incomplete sentences that are 
largely unrelated to the overall contents of the associated 
page and to the apparent intent of the query 
while these differences may seem minor they may also 
have a substantial impact on user behavior a principal 
motivation for providing a caption is to assist the user in 
determining the relevance of the associated page without 
actually having to click through to the result in the case of 
a navigational query - particularly when the destination is 
well known - the url alone may be sufficient to identify 
the desired page but in the case of an informational query 
the title and snippet may be necessary to guide the user in 
selecting a page for further study and she may judge the 
relevance of a page on the basis of the caption alone 
when this judgment is correct it can speed the search 
process by allowing the user to avoid unwanted material 
when it fails the user may waste her time clicking through 
to an inappropriate result and scanning a page containing 
little or nothing of interest even worse the user may be 
misled into skipping a page that contains desired 
information 
all three of the results in figure are relevant with some 
limitations the first result links to the main yahoo kids 
homepage but it is then necessary to follow a link in a menu 
to find the main page for games despite appearances the 
second result links to a surprisingly large collection of 
online games primarily with environmental themes the third 
result might be somewhat disappointing to a user since it 
leads to only a single game hosted at the centers for disease 
control that could not reasonably be described as online 
unfortunately these page characteristics are not entirely 
reflected in the captions 
in this paper we examine the influence of caption 
features on user s web search behavior using clickthroughs 
extracted from search engines logs as our primary 
investigative tool understanding this influence may help to validate 
algorithms and guidelines for the improved generation of the 
figure top three results for the query kids online games 
captions themselves in addition these features can play a 
role in the process of inferring relevance judgments from user 
behavior by better understanding their influence better 
judgments may result 
different caption generation algorithms might select 
snippets of different lengths from different areas of a page 
snippets may be generated in a query-independent fashion 
providing a summary of the page as a whole or in a 
querydependent fashion providing a summary of how the page 
relates to the query terms the correct choice of snippet 
may depend on aspects of both the query and the result 
page the title may be taken from the html header or 
extracted from the body of the document for links that 
re-direct it may be possible to display alternative urls 
moreover for pages listed in human-edited web directories 
such as the open directory project 
 it may be possible 
to display alternative titles and snippets derived from these 
listings 
when these alternative snippets titles and urls are 
available the selection of an appropriate combination for display 
may be guided by their features a snippet from a web 
directory may consist of complete sentences and be less 
fragmentary than an extracted snippet a title extracted from 
the body may provide greater coverage of the query terms 
a url before re-direction may be shorter and provide a 
clearer idea of the final destination 
the work reported in this paper was undertaken in the 
context of the windows live search engine the image in 
figure was captured from windows live and cropped to 
eliminate branding advertising and navigational elements the 
experiments reported in later sections are based on 
windows live query logs result pages and relevance judgments 
collected as part of ongoing research into search engine 
performance nonetheless given the similarity of caption 
formats across the major web search engines we believe the 
results are applicable to these other engines the query in 
 
www dmoz org 
figure produces results with similar relevance on the other 
major search engines this and other queries produce 
captions that exhibit similar variations in addition we believe 
our methodology may be generalized to other search 
applications when sufficient clickthrough data is available 
 related work 
while commercial web search engines have followed 
similar approaches to caption display since their genesis 
relatively little research has been published about methods for 
generating these captions and evaluating their impact on 
user behavior most related research in the area of document 
summarization has focused on newspaper articles and 
similar material rather than web pages and has conducted 
evaluations by comparing automatically generated summaries 
with manually generated summaries most research on the 
display of web results has proposed substantial interface 
changes rather than addressing details of the existing 
interfaces 
 display of web results 
varadarajan and hristidis are among the few who 
have attempted to improve directly upon the snippets 
generated by commercial search systems without introducing 
additional changes to the interface they generated 
snippets from spanning trees of document graphs and 
experimentally compared these snippets against the snippets 
generated for the same documents by the google desktop search 
system and msn desktop search system they evaluated 
their method by asking users to compare snippets from the 
various sources 
cutrell and guan conducted an eye-tracking study to 
investigate the influence of snippet length on web search 
performance and found that the optimal snippet length 
varied according to the task type with longer snippets leading 
to improved performance for informational tasks and shorter 
snippets for navigational tasks 
many researchers have explored alternative methods for 
displaying web search results dumais et al compared an 
interface typical of those used by major web search engines 
with one that groups results by category finding that users 
perform search tasks faster with the category interface paek 
et al propose an interface based on a fisheye lens in 
which mouse hovers and other events cause captions to zoom 
and snippets to expand with additional text 
white et al evaluated three alternatives to the 
standard web search interface one that displays expanded 
summaries on mouse hovers one that displays a list of top 
ranking sentences extracted from the results taken as a group 
and one that updates this list automatically through 
implicit feedback they treat the length of time that a user 
spends viewing a summary as an implicit indicator of 
relevance their goal was to improve the ability of users to 
interact with a given result set helping them to look 
beyond the first page of results and to reduce the burden of 
query re-formulation 
 document summarization 
outside the narrow context of web search considerable 
related research has been undertaken on the problem of 
document summarization the basic idea of extractive 
summarization - creating a summary by selecting sentences or 
fragments - goes back to the foundational work of luhn 
luhn s approach uses term frequencies to identify 
significant words within a document and then selects and extracts 
sentences that contain significant words in close proximity 
a considerable fraction of later work may be viewed as 
extending and tuning this basic approach developing 
improved methods for identifying significant words and 
selecting sentences for example a recent paper by sun et 
al describes a variant of luhn s algorithm that uses 
clickthrough data to identify significant words at its 
simplest snippet generation for web captions might also be 
viewed as following this approach with query terms taking 
on the role of significant words 
since the annual document understanding 
conference duc series conducted by the us national institute 
of standards and technology has provided a vehicle for 
evaluating much of the research in document 
summarization 
 each year duc defines a methodology for one or 
more experimental tasks and supplies the necessary test 
documents human-created summaries and automatically 
extracted baseline summaries the majority of 
participating systems use extractive summarization but a number 
attempt natural language generation and other approaches 
evaluation at duc is achieved through comparison with 
manually generated summaries over the years duc has 
included both single-document summarization and 
multidocument summarization tasks the main duc task 
is posed as taking place in a question answering context 
given a topic and documents participants were asked 
to generate a -word summary satisfying the information 
need enbodied in the topic we view our approach of 
evaluating summarization through the analysis of web logs as 
complementing the approach taken at duc 
a number of other researchers have examined the value 
of query-dependent summarization in a non-web context 
tombros and sanderson compared the performance of 
 subjects searching a collection of newspaper articles when 
 
duc nist gov 
guided by query-independent vs query-dependent snippets 
the query-independent snippets were created by extracting 
the first few sentences of the articles the query-dependent 
snippets were created by selecting the highest scoring 
sentences under a measure biased towards sentences containing 
query terms when query-dependent summaries were 
presented subjects were better able to identify relevant 
documents without clicking through to the full text 
goldstein et al describe another extractive system for 
generating query-dependent summaries from newspaper 
articles in their system sentences are ranked by combining 
statistical and linguistic features they introduce 
normalized measures of recall and precision to facilitate evaluation 
 clickthroughs 
queries and clickthroughs taken from the logs of 
commercial web search engines have been widely used to improve 
the performance of these systems and to better understand 
how users interact with them in early work broder 
examined the logs of the altavista search engine and 
identified three broad categories of web queries informational 
navigational and transactional rose and levinson 
conducted a similar study developing a hierarchy of query goals 
with three top-level categories informational navigational 
and resource under their taxonomy a transactional query 
as defined by broder might fall under either of their three 
categories depending on details of the desired transaction 
lee et al used clickthrough patterns to 
automatically categorize queries into one of two categories 
informational - for which multiple websites may satisfy all or part 
of the user s need - and navigational - for which users 
have a particular website in mind under their taxonomy 
a transactional or resource query would be subsumed under 
one of these two categories 
agichtein et al interpreted caption features clickthroughs 
and other user behavior as implicit feedback to learn 
preferences and improve ranking in web search xue et 
al present several methods for associating queries with 
documents by analyzing clickthrough patterns and links 
between documents queries associated with documents in 
this way are treated as meta-data in effect they are added 
to the document content for indexing and ranking purposes 
of particular interest to us is the work of joachims et 
al and granka et al they conducted eye-tracking 
studies and analyzed log data to determine the extent to 
which clickthrough data may be treated as implicit relevance 
judgments they identified a trust bias which leads users 
to prefer the higher ranking result when all other factors are 
equal in addition they explored techniques that treat clicks 
as pairwise preferences for example a click at position 
n - after skipping the result at position n - may be 
viewed as a preference for the result at position n relative 
to the result at position n these findings form the basis of 
the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret 
user interactions with search results our examination of 
large search logs compliments their detailed analysis of a 
smaller number of participants 
 clickthrough inversions 
while other researchers have evaluated the display of web 
search results through user studies - presenting users with 
a small number of different techniques and asking them to 
complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem 
by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs 
examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many 
more queries and caption characteristics with the volume 
of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled 
lab environment 
the problem remains of interpreting the information in 
these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences and in 
this matter we are guided by the work of joachims et al 
we consider caption pairs which appear adjacent to one 
another in the result list 
our primary tool for examining the influence of caption 
features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these 
caption pairs which we call a clickthrough inversion a 
clickthrough inversion occurs at position n when the result 
at position n receives fewer clicks than the result at position 
n following joachims et al we interpret a 
clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower 
ranking result overcoming any trust bias for simplicity 
in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher 
ranking caption in a pair as caption a and the lower ranking 
caption as caption b 
 extracting clickthroughs 
for the experiments reported in this paper we sampled 
a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of 
the windows live search engine over a period of - days 
on three separate occasions once for results reported in 
section once for a pilot of our main experiment and once 
for the experiment itself sections and for simplicity 
we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the us 
english interface and ignored any queries containing complex 
or non-alphanumeric terms e g operators and phrases at 
the end of each sampling period we downloaded captions 
for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample 
when identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs we 
consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user 
after entering a query and viewing the result page users 
are identified by ip address which is a reasonably reliable 
method of eliminating multiple results from a single user 
at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users 
sharing the same address 
by focusing on the initial clickthrough we hope to 
capture a user s impression of the relative relevance within a 
caption pair when first encountered if the user later clicks 
on other results or re-issues the same query we ignore these 
actions any preference captured by a clickthrough 
inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing 
a particular query rather than a preference on the part of a 
single user in the remainder of the paper we use the term 
clickthrough to refer only to this initial action 
given the dynamic nature of the web and the volumes of 
data involved search engine logs are bound to contain 
considerable noise for example even over a period of hours 
or minutes the order of results for a given query can change 
with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones 
appearing for this reason we retained clickthroughs for 
a specific combination of a query and a result only if this 
result appears in a consistent position for at least of 
the clickthroughs clickthroughs for the same result when 
it appeared at other positions were discarded for 
similar reasons if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs 
for a particular query during the sampling period no 
clickthroughs for that query were retained

figure clickthrough curves for three queries a 
a stereotypical navigational query b a stereotypical

clickthrough inversions 
the outcome at the end of each sampling period is a set 
of records with each record describing the clickthroughs for 
a given query result combination each record includes a 
query a result position a title a snippet a url the 
number of clickthroughs for this result and the total number of 
clickthroughs for this query we then processed this set to 
generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions 
 clickthrough curves 
it could be argued that under ideal circumstances 
clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine 
logs a hypothetical perfect search engine would respond 
to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant 
first in the result list each caption would appropriately 
summarize the content of the linked page and its 
relationship to the query allowing users to make accurate 
judgments later results would complement earlier ones linking 
to novel or supplementary material and ordered by their 
interest to the greatest number of users 
figure provides clickthrough curves for three example 
queries for each example we plot the percentage of 
clickthroughs against position for the top ten results the first 
query craigslist is stereotypically navigational showing 
a spike at the correct answer www craigslist org the 
second query is informational in the sense of lee et al 
 periodic table of elements its curve is flatter and less 
skewed toward a single result for both queries the number 
of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions with 
the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as 
position increases the ideal behavior 
regrettably no search engine is perfect and clickthrough 
inversions are seen for many queries for example for the 
third query kids online games the clickthrough curve 
exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions with an apparent 
preference for the result at position 
several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of 
an inversion in a clickthrough curve the search engine may 
have failed in its primary goal ranking more relevant results 
below less relevant results even when the relative ranking 
is appropriate a caption may fail to reflect the content of 
the underlying page with respect to the query leading the 
user to make an incorrect judgment before turning to the 
second case we address the first and examine the extent to 
which relevance alone may explain these inversions 
 relevance 
the simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough 
inversion is a relevance difference between the higher 
ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member 
in order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a 
role in clickthrough inversions we conducted an initial 
experiment using a set of queries with associated 
judgments created as part of on-going work over a four-day 
period we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over 
one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries from 
these clicks we identified clickthrough inversions 
satisfying the criteria of section where relevance judgments 
existed for both pages 
the relevance judgments were made by independent 
assessors viewing the pages themselves rather than the captions 
relevance was assessed on a -point scale the outcome is 
presented in figure which shows the explicit judgments 
for the clickthrough inversions in all of these cases 
there were more clicks on the lower ranked member of the 
relationship number percent 
rel a rel b 
rel a rel b 
rel a rel b 
figure relevance relationships at clickthrough 
inversions compares relevance between the higher 
ranking member of a caption pair rel a to the 
relevance of the lower ranking member rel b where 
caption a received fewer clicks than caption b 
pair b the figure shows the corresponding relevance 
judgments for example the first row rel a rel b indicates 
that the higher ranking member of pair a was rated as 
less relevant than the lower ranking member of the pair b 
as we see in the figure relevance alone appears inadequate 
to explain the majority of clickthrough inversions for 
twothirds of the inversions the page associated with 
caption a is at least as relevant as the page associated with 
caption b for of the inversions a has greater relevance 
than b which received the greater number of clickthroughs 
 influence of caption features 
having demonstrated that clickthrough inversions cannot 
always be explained by relevance differences we explore 
what features of caption pairs if any lead users to prefer 
one caption over another for example we may 
hypothesize that the absence of a snippet in caption a and the 
presence of a snippet in caption b e g captions and 
in figure leads users to prefer caption a nonetheless 
due to competing factors a large set of clickthrough 
inversions may also include pairs where the snippet is missing in 
caption b and not in caption a however if we compare a 
large set of clickthrough inversions to a similar set of pairs 
for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their 
ranking we would expect to see relatively more pairs where the 
snippet was missing in caption a 
 evaluation methodology 
following this line of reasoning we extracted two sets 
of caption pairs from search logs over a three day period 
the first is a set of nearly five thousand clickthrough 
inversions extracted according to the procedure described in 
section the second is a corresponding set of caption 
pairs that do not exhibit clickthrough inversions in other 
words for pairs in this set the result at the higher rank 
 caption a received more clickthroughs than the result at 
the lower rank caption b to the greatest extent possible 
each pair in the second set was selected to correspond to a 
pair in the first set in terms of result position and number 
of clicks on each result we refer to the first set containing 
clickthrough inversions as the inv set we refer to the 
second set containing caption pairs for which the clickthroughs 
are consistent with their rank order as the con set 
we extract a number of features characterizing snippets 
 described in detail in the next section and compare the 
presence of each feature in the inv and con sets we 
describe the features as a hypothesized preference e g a 
preference for captions containing a snippet thus in 
either set a given feature may be present in one of two forms 
favoring the higher ranked caption caption a or favoring 
the lower ranked caption caption b for example the 
abfeature tag description 
missingsnippet snippet missing in caption a and present in caption b 
snippetshort short snippet in caption a characters with long snippet characters in caption b 
termmatchtitle title of caption a contains matches to fewer query terms than the title of caption b 
termmatchts title snippet of caption a contains matches to fewer query terms than the title snippet of caption b 
termmatchtsu title snippet url of caption a contains matches to fewer query terms than caption b 
titlestartquery title of caption b but not a starts with a phrase match to the query 
queryphrasematch title snippet url contains the query as a phrase match 
matchall caption b contains one match to each term caption a contains more matches with missing terms 
urlquery caption b url is of the form www query com where the query matches exactly with spaces removed 
urlslashes caption a url contains more slashes i e a longer path length than the caption b url 
urllendiff caption a url is longer than the caption b url 
official title or snippet of caption b but not a contains the term official with stemming 
home title or snippet of caption b but not a contains the phrase home page 
image title or snippet of caption b but not a contains a term suggesting the presence of an image gallery 
readable caption b but not a passes a simple readability test 
figure features measured in caption pairs caption a and caption b with caption a as the higher ranked 
result these features are expressed from the perspective of the prevalent relationship predicted for clickthrough 
inversions 
sence of a snippet in caption a favors caption b and the 
absence of a snippet in caption b favors caption a when 
the feature favors caption b consistent with a clickthrough 
inversion we refer to the caption pair as a positive pair 
when the feature favors caption a we refer to it as a 
negative pair for missing snippets a positive pair has the 
caption missing in caption a but not b and a negative 
pair has the caption missing in b but not a 
thus for a specific feature we can construct four subsets 
 inv the set of positive pairs from inv inv− the 
set of negative pairs from inv con the set of positive 
pairs from con and con− the set of negative pairs 
from con the sets inv inv− con and con− will 
contain different subsets of inv and con for each feature 
when stating a feature corresponding to a hypothesized user 
preference we follow the practice of stating the feature with 
the expectation that the size of inv relative to the size 
of inv− should be greater than the size of con relative 
to the size of con− for example we state the missing 
snippet feature as snippet missing in caption a and present 
in caption b 
this evaluation methodology allows us to construct a 
contingency table for each feature with inv essentially forming 
the experimental group and con the control group we can 
then apply pearson s chi-square test for significance 
 features 
figure lists the features tested many of the features on 
this list correspond to our own assumptions regarding the 
importance of certain caption characteristics the presence 
of query terms the inclusion of a snippet and the 
importance of query term matches in the title other features 
suggested themselves during the examination of the snippets 
collected as part of the study described in section and 
during a pilot of the evaluation methodology section 
for this pilot we collected inv and con sets of similar sizes 
and used these sets to evaluate a preliminary list of features 
and to establish appropriate parameters for the 
snippetshort and readable features in the pilot all of the features 
list in figure were significant at the level a small 
number of other features were dropped after the pilot 
these features all capture simple aspects of the captions 
the first feature concerns the existence of a snippet and the 
second concerns the relative size of snippets apart from 
this first feature we ignore pairs where one caption has a 
missing snippet these pairs are not included in the sets 
constructed for the remaining features since captions with 
missing snippets do not contain all the elements of a 
standard caption and we wanted to avoid their influence 
the next six features concern the location and number of 
matching query terms for the first five a match for each 
query term is counted only once additional matches for the 
same term are ignored the matchall feature tests the idea 
that matching all the query terms exactly once is preferable 
to matching a subset of the terms many times with a least 
one query term unmatched 
the next three features concern the urls capturing 
aspects of their length and complexity and the last four 
features concern caption content the first two of these content 
features official and home suggest claims about the 
importance or significance of the associated page the third 
content feature image suggests the presence of an image 
gallery a popular genre of web page terms represented by 
this feature include pictures pics and gallery 
the last content feature readable applies an ad-hoc 
readability metric to each snippet regular users of web 
search engines may notice occasional snippets that consist 
of little more than lists of words and phrases rather than a 
coherent description we define our own metric since the 
flesch-kincaid readability score and similar measures are 
intended for entire documents not text fragments while the 
metric has not been experimentally validated it does reflect 
our intuitions and observations regarding result snippets in 
english the most frequent words represent about 
of text and we would expect readable prose as opposed to 
a disjointed list of words to contain these words in roughly 
this proportion the readable feature computes the 
percentage of these top- words appearing in each caption 
if these words represent more than of one caption and 
less than of the other the pair is included in the 
appropriate set

 commentary 
the results support claims that missing snippets short 
snippets missing query terms and complex urls negatively 
impact clickthroughs while this outcome may not be 
surprising we are aware of no other work that can provide 
support for claims of this type in the context of a commercial 
web search engine 
this work was originally motivated by our desire to 
validate some simple guidelines for the generation of 
captionssummarizing opinions that we formulated while working on 
related issues while our results do not direct address all 
of the many variables that influence users understanding 
of captions they are consistent with the major guidelines 
further work is needed to provide additional support for 
the guidelines and to understand the relationships among 
variables 
the first of these guidelines underscores the importance of 
displaying query terms in context whenever possible all of 
the query terms should appear in the caption reflecting their 
relationship to the associated page if a query term is 
missing from a caption the user may have no idea why the result 
was returned the results for the matchall feature directly 
support this guideline the results for termmatchtitle and 
termmatchtsu confirm that matching more terms is 
desirable other features provide additional indirect support for 
this guideline and none of the results are inconsistent with 
it 
a second guideline speaks to the desirability of 
presenting the user with a readable snippet when query terms are 
present in the title they need not be repeated in the 
snippet in particular when a high-quality query-independent 
summary is available from an external source such as a 
web directory it may be more appropriate to display this 
summary than a lower-quality query-dependent fragment 
selected on-the-fly when titles are available from multiple 
sources -the header the body web directories - a caption 
generation algorithm might a select a combination of title 
snippet and url that includes as many of the query terms 
as possible when a title containing all query terms can be 
found the algorithm might select a query-independent 
snippet the matchall and readable features directly support 
this guideline once again other features provide indirect 
support and none of the results are inconsistent with it 
finally the length and complexity of a url influences 
user behavior when query terms appear in the url they 
should highlighted or otherwise distinguished when 
multiple urls reference the same page due to re-directions 
etc the shortest url should be preferred provided that 
all query terms will still appear in the caption in other 
words urls should be selected and displayed in a manner 
that emphasizes their relationship to the query the three 
url features as well as termmatchtsu directly support 
this guideline 
the influence of the official and image features led us to 
wonder what other terms are prevalent in the captions of 
clickthrough inversions as an additional experiment we 
treated each of the terms appearing in the inv and con 
sets as a separate feature case normalized ranking them by 
their χ 
values the results are presented in figure since 
we use the χ 
statistic as a divergence measure rather than 
a significance test no p-values are given the final column 
of the table indicates the direction of the influence whether 
the presence of the terms positively or negatively influence 
clickthroughs 
the positive influence of official has already been 
observed the difference in the χ 
value from that of figure is 
due to stemming none of the terms included in the image

most surprising to us is the negative influence of the terms 
encyclopedia wikipedia free and medlineplus the 
first three terms appear in the title of wikipedia articles 
and the last appears in the title of medlineplus articles 
 
these individual word-level features provide hints about 
issues more detailed analyses and further experiments will 
be required to understand these features 
 conclusions 
clickthrough inversions form an appropriate tool for 
assessing the influence of caption features using clickthrough 
inversions we have demonstrated that relatively simple 
caption features can significantly influence user behavior to 
our knowledge this is first methodology validated for 
assessing the quality of web captions through implicit 
feedback in the future we hope to substantially expand this 
work considering more features over larger datasets we 
also hope to directly address the goal of predicting relevance 
from clickthoughs and other information present in search 
engine logs
