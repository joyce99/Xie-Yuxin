abstract 
in many settings competing technologies - for example 
operating systems instant messenger systems or document 
formatscan be seen adopting a limited amount of compatibility with one 
another in other words the difficulty in using multiple technologies 
is balanced somewhere between the two extremes of impossibility 
and effortless interoperability there are a range of reasons why 
this phenomenon occurs many of which - based on legal social 
or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical 
models despite this we show that the advantages of limited 
compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social 
networks thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in 
purely strategic terms 
our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in 
the economics literature which seeks to model how a new 
technology a might spread through a social network of individuals who 
are currently users of technology b we consider several ways of 
capturing the compatibility of a and b focusing primarily on a 
model in which users can choose to adopt a adopt b or - at an 
extra cost - adopt both a and b we characterize how the 
ability of a to spread depends on both its quality relative to b and 
also this additional cost of adopting both and find some surprising 
non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these 
parameters in some cases for one technology to survive the introduction 
of another the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced 
within a narrow intermediate range we also extend the framework 
to the case of multiple technologies where we find that a simple

 introduction 
diffusion and networked coordination games a fundamental 
question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which 
new ideas behaviors and practices diffuse through populations 
such issues arise for example in the adoption of new technologies 
the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions 
or the spread of human languages an active line 
of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned 
with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination 
game played on a social network 
we begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic 
diffusion models proposed in an influential paper of morris 
which will form the starting point for our work here we describe 
it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario though 
there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose 
suppose there are two instant messenger im systems a and b 
which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system 
in order to communicate there is a social network g on the users 
indicating who wants to talk to whom and the endpoints of each 
edge v w play a coordination game with possible strategies a 
or b if v and w each choose im system b then they they each 
receive a payoff of q since they can talk to each other using system 
b if they each choose im system a then they they each receive 
a payoff of − q and if they choose opposite systems then they 
each receive a payoff of reflecting the lack of interoperability 
note that a is the better technology if q 
 
 in the sense that 
a-a payoffs would then exceed b-b payoffs while a is the worse 
technology if q 
 
 
 
a number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion 
model even at this level of simplicity specifically consider a 
network g and let all nodes initially play b now suppose a small 
number of nodes begin adopting strategy a instead if we apply 
best-response updates to nodes in the network then nodes in effect 
will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule switch to a 
if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted a e g 
you begin using a particular im system - or social-networking 
site or electronic document format - if enough of your friends 
are users of it as this unfolds there can be a cascading sequence 
of nodes switching to a such that a network-wide equilibrium is 
reached in the limit this equilibrium may involve uniformity with 
all nodes adopting a or it may involve coexistence with the nodes 
partitioned into a set adopting a and a set adopting b and edges 
yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets morris provides 
a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these 
qualitatively different types of equilibria arise in terms of the 
underlying network topology and the quality of a relative to b i e 
the relative sizes of − q and q 
compatibility interoperability and bilinguality in most of the 
settings that form the motivation for diffusion models coexistence 
 however unbalanced is the typical outcome for example human 
languages and social conventions coexist along geographic 
boundaries it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use 
windows while the entertainment industry uses mac os an important 
piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic 
models of diffusion however is a more detailed picture of what is 
happening at the coexistence boundary where the basic form of the 
model posits nodes that adopt a linked to nodes that adopt b 
in these motivating settings for the models of course one very 
often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become 
bilingual in the case of human language diffusion this 
bilinguality is meant literally geographic regions where there is substantial 
interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have 
inhabitants who speak both but bilinguality is also an essential 
feature of technological interaction in the end many people have 
accounts on multiple im systems for example and more 
generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer 
systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each 
taking this view it is natural to ask how diffusion models 
behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this 
very general sense adopting both strategies at some cost to 
themselves what might we learn from such an extension to begin 
with it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the 
question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins 
competition among technology companies there is a large literature 
on how compatibility among technologies affects competition 
between firms and in particular how incompatibility may be a 
beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market 
 whinston provides an interesting taxonomy of different 
kinds of strategic incompatibility and specific industry case studies 
 including theoretical perspectives have recently been carried out 
for commercial banks copying and imaging technology 
and instant messenger systems 
while these existing models of compatibility capture network 
effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use 
technology that is more widespread they do not capture the more 
finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each 
user is including its local view in the decision based on what its 
own social network neighbors are doing a diffusion model that 
incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure 
of boundaries in the network between technologies it could 
potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may 
benefit an existing technology by strengthening these boundaries 
and preventing the incursion of a new better technology 
the present work diffusion with bilingual behavior in this 
paper we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions 
of compatibility and bilinguality and we find that some unexpected 
phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models 
we begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending morris s 
model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior consider 
again the example of im systems a and b with the payoff 
structure as before but now suppose that each node can adopt a third 
strategy denoted ab in which it decides to use both a and b an 
adopter of ab gets to use on an edge-by-edge basis whichever 
of a or b yields higher payoffs in each interaction and the payoff 
structure is defined according to this principle if an adopter of ab 
interacts with an adopter of b both receive q with an adopter of 
a both receive − q and with another adopter of ab both 
receive max q − q finally an adopter of ab pays a fixed-cost 
penalty of c i e −c is added to its total payoff to represent the 
cost of having to maintain both technologies 
thus in this model there are two parameters that can be varied 
the relative qualities of the two technologies encoded by q and 
the cost of being bilingual which reflects a type of incompatibility 
 encoded by c 
following we assume the underlying graph g is infinite 
we further assume that for some natural number δ each node has 
degree δ 
we are interested in the question posed at the outset of 
whether a new technology a can spread through a network where 
almost everyone is initially using b formally we say that strategy 
a can become epidemic if the following holds starting from a state 
in which all nodes in a finite set s adopt a and all other nodes 
adopt b a sequence of best-response updates potentially with 
tiebreaking in g − s causes every node to eventually adopt a we 
also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in 
the subsequent sections we define r c δ the fixed penalty for 
adopting ab scaled so that it is a per-edge cost 
in the morris model where the only strategic options are a and 
b a key parameter is the contagion threshold of g denoted q 
 g 
this is the supremum of q for which a can become epidemic in 
g with parameter q in the payoff structure a central result of 
 is that 
 
is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any 
graph supg q 
 g 
 
 indeed there exist graphs in which the 
contagion threshold is as large as 
 
 including the infinite line - the 
unique infinite connected -regular graph on the other hand one 
can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 
 
 
 
in our model where the bilingual strategy ab is possible we 
have a two-dimensional parameter space so instead of a 
contagion threshold q 
 g we have an epidemic region ω g which 
is the subset of the q r plane for which a can become epidemic 
in g and in place of the maximum possible contagion 
threshold supg q 
 g we must consider the general epidemic region 
ω ∪gω g where the union is taken over all infinite δ-regular 
graphs this is the set of all q r values for which a can become 
epidemic in some δ-regular network 
 
we can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of 
finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically but the use of 
an infinite bounded-degree graph g makes it conceptually much 
cleaner to express the results as it does in morris s paper less 
intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties 
and the qualitative phenomena remain the same 
 
 
r 
q 
 
 
 
figure the region of the q r plane for which technology a 
can become epidemic on the infinite line 
our results we find first of all that the epidemic region ω g 
can be unexpectedly complex even for very simple graphs g 
figure shows the epidemic region for the infinite line one observes 
that neither the region ω g nor its complement is convex in the 
positive quadrant due to the triangular cut-out shape we find 
analogous shapes that become even more complex for other 
simple infinite graph structures see for example figures and in 
particular this means that for values of q close to but less than 
 
 
strategy a can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is 
sufficiently small or sufficiently large but not if r takes values in some 
intermediate interval in other words strategy b which represents 
the worse technology since q 
 
 will survive if and only if the 
cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval 
this is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in 
the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not 
too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising 
that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network 
structure it is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative 
interpretation of how this arises from the model and in fact it is not hard to 
give such an interpretation as follows 
when r is very small it is cheap for nodes to adopt ab as 
a strategy and so ab spreads through the whole network 
once ab is everywhere the best-response updates cause all 
nodes to switch to a since they get the same interaction 
benefits without paying the penalty of r 
when r is very large nodes at the interface with one a 
neighbor and one b neighbor will find it too expensive to choose 
ab so they will choose a the better technology and hence 
a will spread step-by-step through the network 
when r takes an intermediate value a node v at the 
interface with one a neighbor and one b neighbor will find it 
most beneficial to adopt ab as a strategy once this happens 
the neighbor of v who is playing b will not have sufficient 
incentive to switch and the best-response updates make no 
further progress hence this intermediate value of r allows 
a boundary of ab to form between the adopters of a and 
the adopters of b 
in short the situation facing b is this if it is too permissive it gets 
invaded by ab followed by a if it is too inflexible forcing nodes 
to choose just one of a or b it gets destroyed by a cascade of 
direct conversions to a but if it has the right balance in the value 
of r then the adoptions of a come to a stop at a bilingual boundary 
where nodes adopt ab 
moving beyond specific graphs g we find that this non-convexity 
holds in a much more general sense as well by considering the 
general epidemic region ω ∪gω g for any given value of δ the 
region ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded 
polygons and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it 
however we can show via a potential function argument that no 
point q r with q 
 
belongs to ω moreover we can show the 
existence of a point q r ∈ ω for which q 
 
 on the other hand 
consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that 
 
 
 r ∈ ω for r and for r sufficiently large hence neither ω 
nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant 
finally we also extend a characterization that morris gave for 
the contagion threshold producing a somewhat more intricate 
characterization of the region ω g in morris s setting without an 
ab strategy he showed that a cannot become epidemic with 
parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset 
s that functions as a well-connected community every node in 
s has at least a − q fraction of its neighbors in s in other 
words tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to 
diffusion in his setting with the ab strategy as a further option a more 
complex structure becomes the obstacle we show that a cannot 
become epidemic with parameters q r if and only if every cofinite 
set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with 
a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes we show that 
such a structure allows nodes to adopt ab at the interface and b 
inside the community itself preventing the further spread of a and 
conversely this is the only way for the spread of a to be blocked 
the analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a 
number of other consequences a basic one is roughly speaking 
that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the 
order in which the updates are sequenced provided only that each 
node attempts to update itself infinitely often 
further extensions another way to model compatibility and 
interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms 
representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting a 
and a node adopting b rather than setting these to we can 
consider setting them to a value x ≤ min q − q we find that 
for the case of two technologies the model does not become more 
general in that any such instance is equivalent by a re-scaling of 
q and r to one where x moreover using our 
characterization of the region ω g in terms of communities and interfaces we 
show a monotonicty result if a can become epidemic on a graph 
g with parameters q r x and then x is increased then a can 
still become epidemic with the new parameters 
we also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an 
extension to k competing technologies for technologies x and 
y let qx denote the payoff from an x-x interaction on an edge 
and qxy denote the payoff from an x-y interaction on an edge 
we consider a setting in which two technologies b and c which 
initially coexist with qbc face the introduction of a third 
better technology a at a finite set of nodes we show an example 
in which b and c both survive in equilibrium if they set qbc in 
a particular range of values but not if they set qbc too low or too 
high to lie in this range thus in even in a basic diffusion model 
with three technologies one finds cases in which two firms have an 
incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance partially increasing 
their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market 
 model 
we now develop some further notation and definitions that will 
be useful for expressing the model recall that we have an infinite 
δ-regular graph g and strategies a b and ab that are used in 
a coordination game on each edge for edge v w the payoff 
 
to each endpoint is if one of the two nodes chooses strategy a 
and the other chooses strategy b − q if one chooses strategy a 
and the other chooses either a or ab q if one chooses strategy b 
and the other chooses either b or ab and max q − q if both 
choose strategy ab the overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of 
the above values over all neighbors w of v minus a cost which is 
if v chooses a or b and c rδ if she chooses ab we refer to 
the overall game played by all nodes in g as a contagion game 
and denote it using the tuple g q r 
this game can have many nash equilibria in particular the 
two states where everybody uses technology a or everybody uses 
technology b are both equilibria of this game as discussed in 
the previous section we are interested in the dynamics of reaching 
an equilibrium in this game in particular we would like to know 
whether it is possible to move from an all-b equilibrium to an all-a 
equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents 
and following a sequence of best-response moves 
we provide a formal description of this question via the 
following two definitions 
definition consider a contagion game g q r a state 
in this game is a strategy profile s v g → a b ab for 
two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ v g if starting from state s 
and letting v play her best-response move breaking ties in favor of 
a and then ab we get to the state s we write s 
v 
→ s similarly 
for two states s and s and a finite sequence s v v vk of 
vertices of g where vi s are not necessarily distinct we say s 
s 
→ 
s if there is a sequence of states s sk− such that s 
v 
→ s 
v 
→ 
s 
v 
→ · · · sk− 
vk 
→ s for an infinite sequence s v v of 
vertices of g we denote the subsequence v v vk by sk we 
say s 
s 
→ s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ v g 
there exists a k v such that for every k k v s 
sk 
→ sk for a 
state sk with sk v s v 
definition for t ⊆ v g we denote by st the strategy 
profile that assigns a to every agent in t and b to every agent in 
v g \ t we say that technology a can become an epidemic in 
the game g q r if there is a finite set t of nodes in g called the 
seed set and a sequence s of vertices in v g \ t where each 
vertex can appear more than once such that st 
s 
→ sv g i e 
endowing agents in t with technology a and letting other agents 
play their best response according to schedule s would lead every 
agent to eventually adopt strategy a 
the above definition requires that the all-a equilibrium be 
reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule s of best-response 
moves in fact we will show in section that if a can become 
an epidemic in a game then for every schedule of best-response 
moves of the nodes in v g \ t in which each node is scheduled 
an infinite number of times eventually all nodes adopt strategy a 
 examples 
we begin by considering some basic examples that yield 
epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed 
 
note that in our definition we assume that agents in t are endowed 
with the strategy a at the beginning alternatively one can define 
the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in t to be endowed with 
any combination of ab and a or with just ab however the 
difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results 
carry over with little or no change to these alternative models 
 
note that we assume agents in the seed set t cannot change their 
strategy

figure the thick line graph 
in section we first discuss a natural δ-regular generalization of 
the infinite line graph and for this one we work out the complete 
analysis that describes the region ω g the set of all pairs q r 
for which the technology a can become an epidemic we then 
describe without the accompanying detailed analysis the epidemic 
regions for the infinite δ-regular tree and for the two-dimensional 
grid 
the infinite line and the thick line graph for a given even 
integer δ we define the thick line graph lδ as follows the vertex 
set of this graph is z × δ where z is the set of all 
integers there is an edge between vertices x i and x i if and 
only if x − x for each x ∈ z we call the set of vertices 
 x i i ∈ δ the x th group of vertices figure 
shows a picture of l 
now assume that starting from a position where every node uses 
the strategy b we endow all agents in a group say group with 
the strategy a consider the decision faced by the agents in group 
 who have their right-hand neighbors using b and their left-hand 
neighbors using a for these agents the payoffs of strategies a 
b and ab are − q δ qδ and δ − rδ respectively 
therefore if 
q ≤ 
 
 
and q ≤ r 
the best response of such an agent is a hence if the above 
inequality holds and we let agents in groups − − play 
their best response in this order then a will become an epidemic 
also if we have q r and q ≤ − r the best response of 
an agent with her neighbors on one side playing a and neighbors 
on the other side playing b is the strategy ab therefore if we 
let agents in groups and − change to their best response they 
would switch their strategy to ab after this agents in group 
will see ab on their left and b on their right for these agents 
 and similarly for the agents in group − the payoff of strategies 
a b and ab are −q δ qδ and q max q −q δ − 
rδ respectively therefore if max q − r ≥ − q and 
max q − r ≥ q or equivalently if 
 r ≤ q and q r ≤ 
 
 
 
the best response of such an agent is ab hence if the above 
inequality holds and we let agents in groups − − play 
their best response in this order then every agent except for agents 
in group switches to ab next if we let agents in groups 
 − − change their strategy again for q ≤ 
every agent will switch to strategy a and hence a becomes an 
epidemic 
 
strictly speaking since we defined a schedule of moves as 
a single infinite sequence of vertices in v g \ t the order 
 − − − − is not a valid schedule 
however since vertices of g have finite degree it is not hard to see 
that any ordering of a multiset containing any possibly infinite 
 
 
r 
q 
 
 
 
 
 
figure epidemic regions for the infinite grid 
 δ

figure epidemic regions for the infinite δ-regular tree 
the above argument shows that for any combination of q r 
parameters in the marked region in figure technology a can 
become an epidemic it is not hard to see that for points outside 
this region a cannot become epidemic 
further examples trees and grids figures and show the 
epidemic regions for the infinite grid and the infinite δ-regular tree 
note they also exhibit non-convexities 
 characterization 
in this section we characterize equilibrium properties of 
contagion games to this end we must first argue that contagion games 
in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria we then discuss 
some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state 
is essentially independent of the order in which best-response 
updates are performed 
we begin with the following lemma which proves that agents 
eventually converge to a fixed strategy and so the final state of a 
game is well-defined by its initial state and an infinite sequence of 
moves specifically we prove that once an agent decides to adopt 
technology a she never discards it and once she decides to discard 
technology b she never re-adopts it thus after an infinite number 
of best-response moves each agent converges to a single strategy 
lemma consider a contagion game g q r and a 
 possibly infinite subset t ⊆ v g of agents let st be the strategy 
profile assigning a to every agent in t and b to every agent in 
v g \ t let s v v be a possibly infinite sequence of 
number of copies of each vertex of v g \ t can be turned 
into an equivalent schedule of moves for example the sequence 
 − − − − − gives the same outcome as 
 − − − − in the thick line example 
agents in v g \ t and consider the sequence of states s s 
obtained by allowing agents to play their best-response in the order 
defined by s i e s 
v 
→ s 
v 
→ s 
v 
→ · · · then for every i one of 
the following holds 
 si vi b and si vi a 
 si vi b and si vi ab 
 si vi ab and si vi a 
 si vi si vi 
proof let x k 
v y indicate that agent v weakly prefers 
strategy x to strategy y in state sk for any k let zk 
a zk 
b and zk 
ab 
be the number of neighbors of v with strategies a b and ab in 
state sk respectively thus for agent v in state sk 
 a k 
v b if − q zk 
a zk 
ab is greater than q zk 
b zk 
ab 
 a k 
v ab if − q zk 
a zk 
ab is greater than − q zk 
a 
qzk 
b max q − q zk 
ab − δr 
 and ab k 
v b if −q zk 
a qzk 
b max q −q zk 
ab −δr 
is greater than q zk 
b zk 
ab 
suppose the lemma is false and consider the smallest i such that the 
lemma is violated let v vi be the agent who played her best 
response at time i thus either si v a and si v b 
or si v a and si v ab or si v ab and 
si v b we show that in the third case agent v could not 
have been playing a best response the other cases are similar 
in the third case we have si v ab and si v b as 
si v ab there must be a time j i where sj 
v 
→ sj and 
sj v ab since this was a best-response move for v 
inequality implies that − q zj 
a max − q zj 
ab ≥ δr 
furthermore as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is 
violated zi 
a ≥ zj 
a and zj 
ab − zi 
ab ≤ zi 
a − zj 
a thus the change q 
in payoff between ab and b plus δr is 
q ≡ − q zi 
a max − q zi 
ab 
≥ − q zi 
a − zj 
a zj 
a 
 max − q zj 
ab − zi 
a zj 
a 
 − q zj 
a max − q zj 
ab 
 max q − q zi 
a − zj 
a 
≥ − q zj 
a max − q zj 
ab 
≥ δr 
and so by inequality b can not be a better response than ab for 
v in state si 
corollary for every infinite sequence s of vertices in 
v g \ t there is a unique state s such that s 
s 
→ s where s 
denotes the initial state where every vertex in t plays a and every 
vertex in v g \ t plays b 
such a state s is called the outcome of the game g q r starting 
from t and using the schedule s 
equivalence of best-response schedules lemma shows that 
the outcome of a game is well-defined and unique the following 
theorems show that the outcome is also invariant to the dynamics 
or sequence of best-response moves under certain mild conditions 
the first theorem states that if the all-a equilibrium is the outcome 
of a game for some unconstrained schedule then it is the outcome 
for any schedule in which each vertex is allowed to move infinitely 
many times the second theorem states that the outcome of a game 
is the same for any schedule of moves in which every vertex moves 
infinitely many times 
 
theorem consider a contagion game g q r a subset 
t ⊆ v g and a schedule s of vertices in v g \ t such that 
the outcome of the game is the all-a equilibrium then for any 
schedule s of vertices in v g \ t such that every vertex in this 
set occurs infinitely many times the outcome of the game using the 
schedule s is also the all-a equilibrium 
proof note that s is a subsequence of s let π s → s be 
the injection mapping s to its subsequence in s we show for any 
vi ∈ s if vi switches to ab then π vi switches to ab or a and 
if vi switches to a then π vi switches to a here v switches to 
x means that after the best-response move the strategy of v is x 
suppose not and let i be the smallest integer such that the statement 
doesn t hold let za zb and zab be the number of neighbors of 
vi with strategies a b and ab in the current state defined by s 
define za zb and zab similarly for s then by lemma and 
the choice of i za ≥ za zb ≤ zb zab − zab ≤ zb − zb and 
zab − zab ≤ za − za now suppose vi switches to ab then 
the same sequence of inequalities as in lemma show that ab 
is a better response than b for π vi although a might be the best 
response and so π vi switches to either ab or a the other case 
 vi switches to a is similar 
theorem consider a contagion game g q r and a 
subset t ⊆ v g then for every two schedules s and s of vertices 
in v g \t such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many 
times in each of these schedules the outcomes of the game using 
these schedules are the same 
proof the proof of this theorem is similar to that of 
theorem and is deferred to the full version of the paper 
blocking structures finally we prove the characterization 
mentioned in the introduction a cannot become epidemic if and only 
if g q r possesses a certain kind of blocking structure this 
result generalizes morris s theorem on the contagion threshold for 
his model in his case without ab as a possible strategy a simpler 
kind of community structure was the obstacle to a becoming 
epidemic 
we begin by defining the blocking structures 
definition consider a contagion game g q r a pair 
 sab sb of disjoint subsets of v g is called a blocking 
structure for this game if for every vertex v ∈ sab 
degsb 
 v 
r 
q 
δ 
and for every vertex v ∈ sb 
 − q degsb 
 v min q − q degsab 
 v − q − r δ 
and 
degsb 
 v q degsab 
 v − q δ 
where degs v denotes the number of neighbors of v in the set s 
theorem for every contagion game g q r 
technology a cannot become epidemic in this game if and only if every 
co-finite set of vertices of g contains a blocking structure 
proof we first show that if every co-finite set of vertices of 
g contains a blocking structure then technology a cannot become 
epidemic let t be any finite set of vertices endowed with 
technology a and let sab sb be the blocking structure contained 
in v g \ t we claim that in the outcome of the game for any 
sequence s of moves the vertices in sab have strategy b or ab and 
the vertices in sb have strategy b suppose not and let v be the first 
vertex in sequence s to violate this i e v ∈ sab switches to a or 
v ∈ sb switches to a or ab suppose v ∈ sab the other cases 
are similar let za zb and zab denote the number of neighbors 
of v with strategies a b and ab respectively as v is the first 
vertex violating the claim za ≤ δ− degsb 
 v − degsab 
 v and 
zb ≥ degsb 
 v we show ab is a better strategy than a for v 
to show this we must prove that − q za qzb max q − 
q zab − δr − q za zab or equivalently the quantity 
q ≡ qzb max q − zab − δr 
q max q − − r δ − max q − za 
 q − max q − zb 
≥ max q − − r δ min q − q degsb 
 v 
− max q − δ − degsb 
 v − degsab 
 v 
≥ min q − q max q − degsb 
 v − rδ 
 q degsb 
 v − rδ 
 
where the last inequality holds by the definition of the blocking 
structure 
we next show that a cannot become epidemic if and only if 
every co-finite set of vertices contains a blocking structure to 
construct a blocking structure for the complement of a finite set t of 
vertices endow t with strategy a and consider the outcome of 
the game for any sequence s which schedules each vertex an 
infinite number of times let sab be the set of vertices with 
strategy ab and sb be the set of vertices with strategy b in this 
outcome note for any v ∈ sab ab is a best-response and so 
is strictly better than strategy a i e q degsb 
 v max q − 
q degsab 
−δr − q degsab 
 v from where it follows that 
degsb 
 v rδ q the inequalities for the vertices v ∈ sb can 
be derived in a similar manner 
a corollary to the above theorem is that for every infinite graph 
g the epidemic regions in the q-r plane for this graph is a finite 
union of bounded and unbounded polygons this is because the 
inequalities defining blocking structures are linear inequalities in 
q and r and the coefficients of these inequalities can take only 
finitely many values 
 non-epidemic regions in general 
graphs 
the characterization theorem in the previous section provides 
one way of thinking about the region ω g the set of all q r 
pairs for which a can become epidemic in the game g q r we 
now consider the region ω ∪gω g where the union is taken 
over all infinite δ-regular graphs this is the set of all q r 
values for which a can become epidemic in some δ-regular network 
the analysis here uses lemma and an argument based on an 
appropriately defined potential function 
the first theorem shows that no point q r with q 
 
belongs 
to ω since q 
 
implies that the incumbent technology b is 
superior it implies that in any network a superior incumbent will 
survive for any level of compatibility 
theorem for every δ-regular graph g and parameters 
q and r the technology a cannot become an epidemic in the game 
 g q r if q 
proof assume for contradiction that there is a δ-regular 
graph g and values q and r a set t of vertices of g that are 
initially endowed with the strategy a and a schedule s of moves 
for vertices in v g \ t such that this sequence leads to an all-a 
equilibrium we derive a contradiction by defining a non-negative 
 
potential function that starts with a finite value and showing that 
after each best response by some vertex the value of this function 
decreases by some positive amount bounded away from zero at 
any state in the game let xa b denote the number of edges in g 
that have one endpoint using strategy a and the other endpoint 
using strategy b furthermore let nab denote the number of agents 
using the strategy ab the potential function is the following 
qxa b cnab 
 recall c δr is the cost of adopting two technologies since g 
has bounded degree and the initial set t is finite the initial value 
of this potential function is finite we now show that every best 
response move decreases the value of this function by some positive 
amount bounded away from zero by lemma we only need to 
analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort 
described by the lemma therefore we have three cases a node u 
switches from strategy b to ab a node u switches from strategy 
ab to a or a node u switches from strategy b to a we consider 
the first case here the proofs for the other cases are similar 
suppose a node u with strategy b switches to strategy ab let 
zab za and zb denote the number of neighbors of u in partition 
piece ab a and b respectively thus recalling that q we 
see u s payoff with strategy b is q zab zb whereas his payoff 
with strategy ab is q zab zb − q za − c in order for 
this strategic change to improve u s payoff it must be the case that 
 − q za ≥ c 
now notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces 
a change in the potential function of −qza c as za edges are 
removed from the xa b edges between a and b and the size of 
partition piece ab is increased by one this change will be 
negative so long as za c q which holds by inequality as q −q 
for q furthermore as za can take only finitely many values 
 za ∈ δ this change is bounded away from zero 
this next theorem shows that for any δ there is a point q r ∈ 
ω for which q 
 
 this means that there is a setting of the 
parameters q and r for which the new technology a is superior but for 
which the incumbent technology is guaranteed to survive regardless 
of the underlying network 
theorem there exist q and r such that for every 
contagion game g q r a cannot become epidemic 
proof the proof is based on the potential function from 
theorem 
qxa b cnab 
we first show that if q is close enough to and r is chosen 
appropriately this potential function is non-increasing specifically 
let 
q 
 
 
− 
 
 δ 
and c rδ α 
where α is any irrational number strictly between and q 
again there are three cases corresponding to the three possible 
strategy changes for a node u let zab za and zb denote the 
number of neighbors of node u in partition piece ab a and b 
respectively 
case b → ab recalling that q we see u s payoff 
with strategy b is q zab zb whereas his payoff with strategy 
ab is − q zab za qzb − c in order for this strategic 
change to improve u s payoff it must be the case that 
 − q zab − q za ≥ c 
now notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces 
a change in the potential function of −qza c as za edges are 
removed from the xa b edges between a and b and the size of 
partition piece ab is increased by one this change will be 
nonpositive so long as za ≥ c q by inequality and the fact that za 
is an integer 
za ≥ 
‰ 
c 
 − q 
− 
 − q zab 
 − q 
ı 
 
substituting our choice of parameters and noting that q ∈ 
and zab ≤ δ we see that the term inside the ceiling is less than 
 and at least 
 
− 
 
 thus the ceiling is one which is 
larger than c q 
case ab → a recalling that q we see u s payoff 
with strategy ab is − q zab za qzb − c whereas her 
payoff with strategy a is − q zab za in order for this 
strategic change to improve u s payoff it must be the case that 
qzb ≤ c 
such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the 
potential function of qzb −c as zb edges are added to the xa b edges 
between a and b and the size of partition piece ab is decreased 
by one this change will be non-positive so long as zb ≤ c q 
which holds by inequality 
case b → a note u s payoff with strategy b is q zab 
zb whereas his payoff with strategy a is − q zab za in 
order for this strategic change to improve u s payoff it must be the 
case that 
 − q zab ≥ qzb − − q za 
such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the 
potential function of q zb − za as za edges are removed and zb 
edges are added to the xa b edges between a and b this change 
will be negative so long as zb za by inequality and the fact 
that za is an integer 
za ≥ 
 
qzb 
 − q 
 
 − q zab 
 − q 
 
substituting our choice of parameters it is easy to see that the term 
inside the floor is at most zb and so the floor is at most 
zb as zb is an integer we have shown the potential function is 
non-increasing for our choice of q and c this implies the potential 
function is eventually constant as c is irrational and the 
remaining terms are always rational both nab and xa b must remain 
constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant 
suppose a is epidemic in this region as nab is constant and 
a is epidemic it must be that nab thus the only moves 
involve a node u switching from strategy b to strategy a in order 
for xa b to be constant for such moves it must be that za the 
number of neighbors of u in a equals zb the number of neighbors 
of u in b and as nab we have that za zb δ thus 
the payoff of u for strategy a is − q za δ whereas her 
payoff for strategy ab is −q za qzb −c δ −q ≥ δ 
this contradicts the assumption that u is playing her best response 
by switching to a 
 limited compatibility 
we now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility 
and interoperability we first consider two technologies as in the 
previous sections and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture 
a positive benefit in direct a-b interactions we find that this is 
 
in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for a-b 
interactions 
we then consider extensions to three technologies identifying 
situations in which two coexisting incumbent technologies may or 
may not want to increases their mutual compatibility in the face of 
a new third technology 
two technologies a natural relaxation of the two-technology model 
is to introduce small positive payoffs for a-b interaction that is 
cross-technology communication yields some lesser value to both 
agents we can model this using a variable xab representing the 
payoff gathered by an agent with technology a when her 
neighbor has technology b and similarly a variable xba representing 
the payoff gathered by an agent with b when her neighbor has a 
here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal 
entries are symmetric i e xab xba x we also assume that 
x q ≤ − q 
we first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is 
equivalent to a game without these entries under a simple re-scaling of 
q and r note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive 
or a multiplicative constant the behavior of the game is unaffected 
given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q r and x 
consider subtracting x from all payoffs and scaling up by a factor 
of − x as can be seen by examining table the resulting 
payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries 
parameterized by q q − x − x and r r − x 
thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not 
expand the class of games being considered 
table represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms 
of these parameters 
nevertheless we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal 
entry might affect the outcome of any particular game as the 
following example shows increasing compatibility between two 
technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic 
to become so 
example consider the contagion game played on a thick 
line graph see section with r and q in this 
case a is not epidemic as can be seen by examining figure 
since r q and q r however if we insert symmetric 
off-diagonal payoffs x we have a new game equivalent to a 
game parameterized by r and q since q 
and q r a is epidemic in this game and thus also in the game 
with limited compatibility 
we now show that generally if a is the superior technology i e 
q adding a compatibility term x can only help a spread 
theorem let g be a game without compatibility 
parameterized by r and q on a particular network let g be that same 
game but with an added symmetric compatibility term x if a is 
epidemic for g then a is epidemic for g 
proof we will show that any blocking structure in g is also 
a blocking structure in g by our characterization theorem 
theorem this implies the desired result we have that g is 
equivalent to a game without compatibility parameterized by q q − 
x − x and r r − x consider a blocking structure 
 sb sab for g we know that for any v ∈ sab q dsb v 
r δ thus 
qdsb v q − x dsb v 
 q − x dsb v 
 r − x δ 
 rδ 
as required for a blocking structure in g similarly the two 
blocking structure constraints for v ∈ sb are only strengthened when 
we move from g to g 
more than two technologies given the complex structure 
inherent in contagion games with two technologies the understanding of 
contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open 
here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with 
multiple technologies through a series of initial results the 
basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies b 
and c are initially coexisting and a third technology a superior 
to both is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes 
we first present a theorem stating that for any even δ there is 
a contagion game on a δ−regular graph in which the two 
incumbent technologies b and c may find it beneficial to increase their 
compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new 
superior technology a in particular we consider a situation in which 
initially two technologies b and c with zero compatibility are at 
a stable state by a stable state we mean that no finite 
perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either b or 
c we also have a technology a that is superior to both b and c 
and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose a 
however by increasing their compatibility b and c can maintain 
their stability and resist an epidemic from a 
let qa denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose 
technology a and define qb and qc analogously we will assume 
qa qb qc we also assume that r the cost of selecting 
additional technologies is sufficiently large so as to ensure that 
nodes never adopt more than one technology finally we 
consider a compatibility parameter qbc that represents the payoffs 
to two adjacent nodes when one selects b and the other selects 
c thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters 
 g qa qb qc qbc 
theorem for any even δ ≥ there is a δ-regular 
graph g an initial state s and values qa qb qc and qbc such 
that 
 s is an equilibrium in both g qa qb qc and 
 g qa qb qc qbc 
 neither b nor c can become epidemic in either 
 g qa qb qc or g qa qb qc qbc starting from state 
s 
 a can become epidemic g qa qb qc starting from state 
s and 
 a can not become epidemic in g qa qb qc qbc 
starting from state s 
proof sketch given δ define g by starting with an infinite 
grid and connecting each node to its nearest δ − neighbors that 
are in the same row the initial state s assigns strategy b to even 
rows and strategy c to odd rows let qa k 
 k 
qb k qc k and qbc k the first third 
and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the 
corresponding inequalities the second claim follows from the first 
and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible 
epidemic from growing vertically 
the above theorem shows that two technologies may both be 
able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing 
their level of compatibility with each other as one might expect 
 
a b ab 
a − q − q x x − q − q − r 
b x x q q q q − r 
ab − q − r − q q − r q max q − q − r max q − q − r 
table the payoffs in the coordination game entry x y in row i column j indicates that the row player gets a payoff of x and 
the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j 
there are cases when increased compatibility between two 
technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other 
surprisingly however there are also instances in which compatibility 
is in fact harmful to both parties the next example considers a fixed 
initial configuration with technologies a b and c that is at 
equilibrium when qbc however if this compatibility term is 
increased sufficiently equilibrium is lost and a becomes epidemic 
example consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional 
grid graph with nodes u x y and an infinite line graph with nodes 
v y add an edge between u y and v y for all y for this 
network we consider the initial configuration in which all v y nodes 
select a and node u x y selects b if x and selects c 
otherwise 
we now define the parameters of this game as follows let qa 
 qb qc and qbc it is easily verified that 
for these values the initial configuration given above is an 
equilibrium however now suppose we increase the coordination term 
setting qbc this is not an equilibrium since each node of 
the form u y now has an incentive to switch from c generating 
a payoff of to b thereby generating a payoff of 
however once these nodes have adopted b the best-response for each 
node of the form u y is a a generates a payoff of where as 
b only generates a payoff of from here it is not hard to 
show that a spreads directly throughout the entire network
