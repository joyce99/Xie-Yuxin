 introduction 
personal information management pim is a rapidly 
growing area of research concerned with how people store 
manage and re-find information pim systems - the methods 
and procedures by which people handle categorize and 
retrieve information on a day-to-day basis - are 
becoming increasingly popular however the evaluation of these 
pim systems is problematic one of the main difficulties is 
caused by the personal nature of pim people collect 
information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks 
this means that the collections people generate are unique 
to them alone and the information within a collection is 
intrinsically linked with the owner s personal experiences as 
personal collections are unique we cannot create evaluation 
tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation 
secondly personal collections may contain information that 
the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an 
evaluation the precise nature of this information - what 
information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across 
individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the 
contents of individual collections therefore experimenters 
face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but 
controlled pim evaluations 
a particular feature of pim research is that many 
systems have been designed to assist users with managing and 
re-finding their information but very few have been 
evaluated a situation noted by several scholars recently 
however researchers have started to focus on ways to 
address the problem of pim evaluation for example kelly 
 proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken 
to examine and understand the many issues involved in pim 
although she makes explicit reference to the need for 
laboratory based pim studies and a common set of shared tasks 
to make this possible capra also identifies the need for 
controlled pim lab evaluations to complement other 
evaluation techniques placing specific emphasis on the need to 
understand pim behaviour at the task level 
in this paper we attempt to address the difficulties 
involved to faciliate controlled laboratory pim evaluations 
in the first part of this paper we present a diary study of 
information re-finding tasks the study examines the kind 
of tasks that require users to re-find information and 
produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and 
web pages we also look at the features of the tasks that 
make re-finding difficult in the second part we propose 
a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings 
and examine the feasibility of the approach using different 
methods of task creation thus this paper offers two 
contributions to the field an increased understanding of pim 
behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that 
will facilitate further investigations 
 related work 
a variety of approaches are available to study pim 
naturalistic approaches study participants performing 
naturally completing their own tasks as they occur within 
familiar environments these approaches allow researchers to 
overcome many of the difficulties caused by the personal 
nature of pim as the tasks performed are real and not 
simulated the participants can utilise their own experiences 
previous knowledge and information collections to complete 
the tasks a benefit of the approach is that data can be 
captured continuously over extended time periods and 
measurements can be taken at fixed points in time within these 
 naturalistic approaches can be applied by 
conducting fieldwork ethnographic methods as suggested by 
 or via log file analysis both ethnographic and 
fieldwork methods require the presence of an experimenter 
to assess how pim is performed which raises a number of 
issues firstly evaluation in this way is expensive taking 
long time periods to study small numbers of participants 
and these small samples may not be representative of the 
behaviour of larger populations secondly because 
participants cannot be continually observed experimenters must 
choose when to observe and this may affect the findings 
an alternative strategy to conducting naturalistic 
evaluations is to utilise log file analysis this approach makes use 
of logging software that captures a broad sampling of user 
activities in the context of natural use of a system in 
a novel pim search tool was deployed to users and the 
log data provided detailed information about the nature of 
user queries interactions with the query interface and about 
properties of the items retrieved log file analysis is a 
powerful methodology as it allows the capture of a large quantity 
of detailed information about how users behave with the 
system without the expense and distracting influence of an 
observer nevertheless there are limitations to this 
strategy firstly to attain useful results the deployed prototype 
must be something that people would use i e it has to be 
a fully functional piece of software that offers improvement 
on the systems ordinarily available to participants 
developing a research prototype to this standard is beyond the 
resources of many researchers further caution must be 
taken when analysing logs as the captured data shows 
nothing about the goals and intentions that the user had at the 
time it is therefore difficult to make any concrete 
statements about the reasons for the behaviour depicted in the 
logs this reveals a need to complement naturalistic studies 
with controlled experiments where the experimenter can 
relate the behaviour of study participants to goals associated 
with known search tasks 
laboratory-based studies simulate users real world 
environment in the controlled setting of the laboratory 
offering the ability to study issues that are tightly defined and 
narrow in scope one difficulty in performing this kind of 
evaluation is sourcing collections to evaluate kelly 
proposes the introduction of a shared test collection that would 
provide sharable reusable data sets tasks and metrics for 
those interested in conducting pim research this may be 
useful for testing algorithms in a way similar to trec in 
mainstream ir however a shared collection would be 
unsuitable for user studies because it would not be 
possible to incorporate the personal aspects of pim while using 
a common unfamiliar collection one alternative approach 
is to ask users to provide their own information collections 
to simulate familiar environments within the lab this 
approach has been applied to study the re-finding of personal 
photographs email messages and web-bookmarks 
 the usefulness of this approach depends on how easy 
it is to transfer the collection or gain remote access 
another solution is to use the entire web as a collection when 
studying web page re-finding this may be appropriate 
for studying web page re-finding because previous studies 
have shown that people often use web search engines for 
this purpose 
a second difficulty in performing pim laboratory 
studies is creating tasks for participants to perform that can be 
solved by searching a shared or personal collection tasks 
relate to the activity that results in a need for information 
 and are acknowledged to be important in determining 
user behaviour a large body of work has been carried 
out to understand the nature of tasks and how the type of 
task influences user information seeking behaviour for 
example tasks have been categorised in terms of increasing 
complexity and task complexity has been suggested to 
affect how searchers perceive their information needs 
and how they try to find information other previous 
work has provided methodologies that allow the simulation 
of tasks when studying information seeking behaviour 
however little is known about the kinds of tasks that cause 
people to search their personal stores or re-find information 
that they have seen before consequently it is difficult to 
devise simulated work task situations for pim the 
exception is the study of personal photograph management where 
rodden s work on categorising personal photograph search 
tasks has facilitated the creation of simulated work task 
situations there have been other suggestions as to how 
to classify pim tasks for example asked participants to 
classify tasks based on how frequently they perform the task 
type in their daily life and how familiar they were with the 
location of the sought after information and several scholars 
have classified information objects by the frequency of their 
use e g while these are interesting properties that 
may affect how a task will be performed they do not give 
experimenters enough scope to devise tasks 
personal collections are one reason why task creation is so 
difficult rodden s photo task taxonomy provides a solution 
here because it allows tasks tailored to private collections 
to be categorised systems can then be compared across 
task types for different users unfortunately no 
equivalent taxonomy exists for other types of information object 
further other types of object are more sensitive to privacy 
than photographs it is unlikely that participants would be 
as content to allow researchers to browse their email 
collections to create tasks as they were with photographs in 
this presents a serious problem - how can researchers 
devise tasks that correspond to private collections without an 
understanding of the kinds of tasks people perform or 
jeopardising the privacy of study participants a few methods 
have been proposed for example studied email search 
by asking participants to re-find emails that had been sent 
to every member in a department allowing the same tasks 
to be used for all of the study participants this approach 
ensured that privacy issues were avoided and participants 
could use things that they remember to complete tasks 
nevertheless the systems were only tested using one type of 
task - participants were asked to find single emails each of 
which shared common properties in section we show that 
people perform a wider range of email re-finding tasks than 
this in generic search tasks were artificially created by 
running evaluations over two sessions in the first session 
participants were asked to complete work tasks that involved 
finding some unknown information in the second session 
participants completed the same tasks again which 
naturally involved some re-finding behaviour the limitations of 
this technique are that it does not allow participants to 
exploit any personal connections with the information because 
the information they are looking for may not correspond to 
any other aspect of their lives further if time is utilised by 
a system or interface being tested the approach is unsuitable 
because all of the objects found in the first session will have 
been accessed within the same time period 
our review of evaluation approaches motivates a 
requirement for controlled laboratory experiments that allow tightly 
defined aspects of systems or interfaces to be tested 
unfortunately it has also been shown that there are difficulties 
involved in performing this type of evaluation - it is difficult 
to source collections and to devise tasks that correspond to 
private collections while at the same time protect the 
privacy of the study participants 
in the following section we present a diary study of 
refinding tasks for email and web pages the outcome is a 
classification of tasks similar to that devised by rodden for 
personal photographs in section we build on this 
work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not 
compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our 
work can facilitate task-based pim user evaluations we 
show that by collecting tasks using electronic diaries not 
only can we learn about the tasks that cause people to re-find 
personal information but we can learn about the contents of 
private collections without compromising the privacy of the 
participants this knowledge can then be used to construct 
tasks for use in pim evaluations 
 method 
diary studies are a naturalistic technique offering the 
ability to capture factual data in a natural setting 
without the distracting influence of an observer limitations of 
the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant 
dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly 
mundane information is useful and should be reported 
 suggest that the effects of the negatives can be 
limited however with careful design and good 
implementation in our diary study we followed the suggestions in 
to achieve the best possible data to this end we restricted 
the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding by asking 
users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that 
participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels 
maintained the participants were provided with a personalised 
web form in which they could record details about their 
information needs and the contexts in which these needs 
developed web forms were deployed rather than 
paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information 
the user would be at a computer with an internet 
connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based 
diary and pen 
the diary form solicited the following information whether 
the information need related to re-finding a web page or an 
email message and a description of the task they are 
performing this description was to contain both the 
information that the participant wished to find and the reason that 
they needed the information to help with this the form 
gave three example task descriptions which were also 
explained verbally to each participant during an introductory 
session the experimenter ensured that the participants 
understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to 
the types shown in the examples the examples were 
supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of 
things they could record and to show the level of and type 
of details expected the form also asked participants to rate 
each task in terms of difficulty on a scale from - where 
 was very easy and was very hard finally they were 
asked when was the last time they looked at the sought 
after information again they were able to choose from 
options less than a day ago less than a week ago less than 
a month ago less than a year ago more than a year ago 
time information was used to examine the frequency with 
which the participants re-found old and new information 
and when combined with difficulty ratings created a 
picture of whether or not the time period between accessing 
and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants 
perceived tasks to be 
 participants recruited by mass advertisement through 
departmental communication channels research group 
meetings and undergraduate lectures were asked to digitally 
record details of their information re-finding tasks over a 
period of approximately weeks the final population 
consisted of academic staff members research staff 
members research students and undergraduate students 
the ages of participants ranged from - as both 
personal and work tasks were recorded the results collected 
cover a broad range of re-finding tasks 
 results 
several analyses were performed on the captured data 
the following sections present the findings firstly we 
examine the kinds of re-finding tasks that were performed both 
when searching on email and on the web next we consider 
the distribution of tasks - which kinds of tasks were 
performed most often by participants lastly we explore the 
kinds of re-finding tasks that participants perceived as 
difficult 
 nature of web and email re-finding tasks 
during the study tasks were recorded 
of these tasks were email based were 
webbased as with most diary studies the number of tasks 
recorded varied extensively between particpants the 
median number of tasks per participant was interquartile 
range iqr more web tasks median iqr 
were recorded than email tasks median iqr this 
means that on average each participant recorded 
approximately one task every two days 
from the descriptions supplied by the participants we 
found similar features in the recorded tasks for both email 
and web re-finding based on this observation a joint 
classification scheme was devised encompassing both email and 
web tasks the tasks were classified as one of three types 
lookup tasks item tasks and multi-item tasks lookup tasks 
involve searching for specific information from within a 
resource for example an email or a web page where the 
resource may or may not be known some recorded examples 
of lookup tasks were 
 lu looking for the course code for a class - it s used in a 
script that is run to set up a practical i d previously obtained 
this about weeks ago from our website 
 lu i am trying to determine the date by which i step down 
as an external examiner this is in an email somewhere 
 lu looking for description of log format from system r 
developed for student project i think he sent me in it an 
email 
item tasks involve looking for a particular email or web 
page perhaps to pass on to someone else or when the entire 
contents are needed to complete the task some recorded 
examples of item tasks were 
 i looking for sigir paper to give to another student 
 i find the receipt of an online airline purchase required to 
claim expenses 
 i i need the peer evaluation forms for the mia class e sent 
me them by email 
to clarify lookup tasks differ from item tasks in two ways 
- in the quantity of information required and in what the 
user knows about what they are looking for lookup tasks 
involve a need for a small piece of information e g a phone 
number or an ingredient and the user may or may not know 
exactly the resource that contains this information in item 
tasks the user knows exactly the resource they are looking 
for and needs the entire contents of that resource 
multi-item tasks were tasks that required information that 
was contained within numerous web pages or email 
messages often these tasks required the user to process or 
collate the information in order to solve the task some 
recorded examples were 
 mi looking for obituaries and other material on the novelist 
john fowles who died at the weekend accessed the online 
guradian and imes 
 mi trying to find details on piccolo graphics framework 
remind myself of what it is and what it does looking to 
build a gui within eclipse 
 mi i am trying to file my emails regarding ipm and i am 
looking for any emails from or about this journal 
there were a number of tasks that were difficult to classify 
for example consider the following recorded task 
 lu re-find as s paper on graded relevance assessments 
because i want to see how she presented her results for a paper i 
am writing 
this task actually consists of two sub-tasks item 
task refind the paper and lookup task look for specific 
information within the paper it was decided to treat this as a 
lookup task because the user s ultimate goal was to access 
and use the information within the resource 
there were a number of examples of combined tasks mainly 
of the form item then lookup but there were also examples 
of item then multi-item for example 
 mi re-find kelkoo website so that i can re-check the prices 
of hair-straighteners for my girlfriend 
a second source of ambiguity came from tasks such as 
finding an email containing a url as a means of re-accessing 
a web page it was also decided to categorise these as lookup 
tasks because in all cases these were logged by participants 
as email searches and within this context what they were 
looking for was information within an email 
another problem was that some of the logs lacked the 
detail required to perform a categorisation e g 
 u searching for how to retrieve user s selection from a 
message box decided to use some other means 
such tasks were labelled as u for unclassifiable to 
verify the consistency of the taxonomy the tasks were 
recategorised by the same researcher after a delay of two weeks 
the agreement between the results of the two analyses was 
largely consistent further we asked a researcher 
with no knowledge of the project or the field to classify a 
sample of tasks the second researcher achieved a 
agreement we feel that this high agreement on a large 
number of tasks by more than one researcher provides evidence 
for the reliability of the classification scheme 
the distribution of task types is shown in table overall 
lookup and item tasks were the most common with 
multiitem tasks only representing of those recorded the 
distribution of the task types was different for web and email 
re-finding the majority of email tasks involved 
looking for information within an email lookup in contrast to 
web tasks where the majority of tasks involved 
looking for a single web page item another distinction 
was the number of recorded multi-item tasks for web and 
email multi-item tasks were very rare for email re-finding 
 only of email tasks involved searching for multiple 
resources but comparatively common for web re-finding

table the distribution of task types 
in addition to the three-way classification described above 
the recorded tasks were classified with respect to the 
temperature metaphor proposed by which classifies 
information as one of three temperatures hot warm and cold 
we classified the tasks using the form data information 
that had been seen less than a day or less than a week 
before the task were defined as hot information that had been 
seen less than a month before the task as warm and 
information that had been seen less than a year or more than a 
year before the task as cold unfortunately a technical 
difficulty with the form only allowed of the tasks to 
be classified the remainder were defined as u for 
unclassifiable a cross-tabulation of task types and temperatures 
is shown in table

all 
table the distribution of temperatures 
most of the tasks that caused people to re-find web pages 
 and email messages involved searching 
for information that has been accessed in the last week 
however there were also a number of re-finding tasks that 
involved searching for older information of the tasks 
recorded for email and for web involved 
searching for information accessed in the last month and 
 of the tasks recorded for email and 
for web were looking for even older information this is 
important with respect to evaluation because there is 
psychological evidence suggesting that people remember less over 
time e g this means that users may find searching for 
older information more difficult or perhaps alter their 
seeking strategy when looking for hot warm or cold information 
 what tasks are difficult 
we looked for patterns in the recorded data to determine 
if certain tasks were perceived as more difficult than 
others for example we examined whether the media type 
affected how difficult the participants perceived the task to be 
there was no evidence that participants found either email 
 median iqr or web median iqr tasks more 
difficult we also investigated whether the type of task or 
the length of time between accessing and re-accessing made 
a task more difficult figure shows this information 
graphically 
figure difficulty ratings for task types 
from figure it does not appear that any particular task 
type was perceived as difficult with respect to the others 
although there is a suggestion that lookup tasks were 
perceived more difficult when looking for cold information than 
hot and item tasks were perceived more difficult for warm 
information than hot to assess the relationship between 
information temperature and the perceived difficulty we 
used mood s median tests to determine whether the rank 
of difficulty scores was in agreement for the information 
temperatures being compared p for the look-up 
task data there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived 
easier than cold p and that warm tasks were 
perceived easier than cold tasks p but there was no 
evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot 
and warm tasks p for the item task data there 
was evidence that hot and cold tasks were rated differently 
 p but no evidence to distinguish between hot and 
warm tasks p or warm and cold tasks p 
these tests confirm that the length of time between 
accessing and re-accessing the sought after information indeed 
influenced how difficult participants perceived the task to 
be nevertheless the large number of tasks of all types and 
temperatures rated by participants as easy i e suggests 
that there are other factors that influence how difficult a task 
is perceived to be to learn about these factors would 
require the kind of user evaluations proposed by - the 
kind of evaluations facilitated by our work 
 summary 
in the first part of this paper we described a diary study 
of web and email re-finding tasks we examined the types 
of task that caused the participants to search their personal 
stores and found three main categories of task tasks where 
the user requires specific information from within a single 
resource tasks where a single resource is required and tasks 
that require information to be recovered from multiple 
resources it was discovered that look-up and item tasks were 
recorded with greater frequency than multi-item tasks 
although no evidence was found that web or email tasks were 
more difficult there was some evidence showing that the 
time between accessing and re-accessing affected how 
difficult the participants perceived tasks to be these findings 
have implications for evaluating pim behaviour at the task 
level the remainder of this paper concentrates on this 
discussing what the findings mean with respect to performing 
task-based pim user evaluations 
 task-based pim evaluations 
the findings described in section are useful with 
respect to evaluation because they provide experimenters with 
enough knowledge to conduct controlled user evaluations in 
lab conditions greco-latin square experimental designs can 
be constructed where participants are assigned n tasks of the 
three types described above to perform on their own 
collections using x systems this would allow the performance of 
the systems or the behaviour of the participants using 
different systems to be analysed with respect to the type of task 
being performed look-up item or multi-item in the 
following sections we evaluate the feasibility of this approach 
when employing different methods of task creation 
 using real tasks 
one method of creating realistic re-finding tasks without 
compromising the privacy of participants is to use real tasks 
diary-studies similar to that described above would allow 
experimenters to capture a pool of tasks for participants 
to complete by searching on their own collections this 
is extremely advantageous because it would allow 
experimenters to evaluate the behaviour of real users 
completing real search tasks on real collections while in a 
controlled environment there is also the additional benefit 
that the task descriptions would not make any assumptions 
about what the user would remember in a real life 
situation because they would only include the information that 
had been recorded i e the information that was available 
when the user originally performed the task nevertheless 
to gain these benefits we must firstly confirm that the task 
descriptions recorded are of sufficient quality to enable the 
task to be re-performed at a later date secondly we must 
ensure that a diary-study would provide experimenters with 
enough tasks to construct a balanced experimental design 
that would satisfy their data needs 
to examine the quality of recorded tasks weeks after 
the diary study had completed we asked of our 
participants selected randomly from the pool of those who 
recorded enough tasks to re-perform of their own tasks 
the tasks were selected randomly from the pool of those 
available the issued tasks consisted of email and 
web tasks of which were lookup tasks were item tasks 
and were multi-item tasks the issued tasks represented a 
broad-sampling of the complete set of recorded tasks they 
also included tasks with vague descriptions e g 
 lu find a software key for an application i required to 
reinstall 
 lu trying to find a quote to use in a paper cannot 
remember the person or the exact quote 
the usefulness of such tasks would rely on the memories of 
participants i e would the recorder of task lu remember 
which application he referred to and would the recorder of 
lu remember enough about the context in which the task 
took place to re-perform the task 
presented with the tasks exactly as they recorded them 
the participants were asked to re-perform each task with any 
system of their choice of the tasks issued 
were completed without problems of the tasks 
were not completed because the description recorded was 
insufficent to recreate the task and tasks were 
not completed because the task was too difficult or the 
required web page no longer existed experimenters are likely 
to be interested in the final group of tasks because it is 
important to discover what makes a task difficult and how user 
behaviour changes in these circumstances therefore from 
the tasks tested only tasks were not of sufficient 
quality to be used in an evaluation situation further there did 
not seem to be any issue of the type temperature or 
difficulty ratings affecting the quality of the task descriptions 
these findings suggest that the participants who recorded 
most tasks in the diary study also recorded tasks with 
sufficient quality however did the diary study generate enough 
tasks to satisfy the needs of experimenters

naturally the exact number of tasks required to perform 
a user evaluation will depend on the goals of the evaluation 
the number of users and the number of systems to be tested 
etc however for illustrative purposes we chose tasks as 
a cut-off point for our data from tables and which 
show the quantities of email and web tasks recorded for each 
participant we can see that of the participants only 
 recorded or more email tasks and 
recorded or more web tasks this means that many of the 
recruited participants could not actually participate in the 
final evaluation this is a major limitation of using recorded 
tasks in evaluations because participant recruitment for user 
tests is challenging and it may not be possible to recruit 
enough participants if experimenters lose between half and 
two-thirds of their populations 
further there was some imbalance in the numbers of 
recorded tasks of different types some participants recorded 
several lookup tasks but very few item tasks and others 
recorded several item tasks but few lookup tasks there 
was also a specific lack of multi-item email tasks this 
situation makes it very difficult for experimenters to prepare 
balanced experimental designs therefore even though our 
first test suggests that the quality of recorded tasks was 
sufficient for the participants to re-perform the tasks at a later 
stage the number of tasks recorded was probably too low 
to make this a viable option for experimental task creation 
however it may be possible to increase the number of tasks 
recorded by frequently reminding participants or by making 
personal visits etc 
 using simulated tasks based on real tasks 
another benefit of diary-studies is that they provide 
information about the contents and uses of private 
collections without invading participants privacy this section 
explores the possibility of using a combination of the 
knowledge gained from diary studies and other attributes known 
about participants to artificially create re-finding tasks 
corresponding to the taxonomy defined in section we 
explain the techniques used and demonstrate the feasibility of 
creating simulated tasks within the context of a user 
evaluation investigating email re-finding behaviour space 
limitations prevent us from reporting our findings instead we 
concentrate on the methods of task creation 
as preparation for the evaluation we performed a 
second diary-study where new participants consisting of 
 post-graduate students and under-graduate students 
recorded email tasks over a period of approximately 
weeks the collected data revealed several patterns that 
helped with the creation of artificial tasks for example 
students in both groups recorded tasks relating to classes 
that they were taking at the time and often different 
participants recorded tasks that involved searching for the same 
information this was useful because it provided us with a 
clue that even though some of the participants did not record 
a particular task it was possible that the task may still be 
applicable to their collections other patterns revealed 
included that students within the same group often searched 
for emails containing announcements from the same source 
for example several undergraduate students recorded tasks 
that included re-finding information relating to job 
vacancies there were also tasks that were recorded by 
participants in both groups for example searching for an email 
that would re-confirm the pin code required to access the 
computer labs 
to supplement our knowledge of the participants email 
collections we asked participants from each group to 
provide email tours these consisted of short - minute 
sessions where participants were asked to explain why they 
use email who sends them email and their organisational 
strategies this approach has been used successfully in the 
past as a non-intrusive means to learn about how people 
store and maintain their personal information 
originally we had planned to ask more participants to provide 
tours but we found tours per group was sufficient for 
our needs again patterns emerged that helped with task 
creation we found content overlap within and between 
groups that confirmed many of our observations from the 
diary study data for example the students who gave tours 
revealed that they received emails from lecturers for 
particular class assignments receipts for completed assignments 
and various announcements from systems support and about 
job vacancies importantly the participants were also able 
to confirm which other students had received the same 
information this confirmed that many of tasks recorded during 
the diary study were applicable not only to the recorder 
but to every participant in or both groups 
based on this initial investigatory work a set of tasks 
 of each type in our taxonomy was created for each group 
of participants we also created a set of tasks for a third 
group of participants that consisted of research and 
academic staff members based on our knowledge of the emails 
our colleagues receive where possible we used the 
information recorded in the diary study descriptions to provide 
a context for the task i e a work task or motivation that 
would require the task to be performed when the diary 
study data did not provide sufficient context information to 
supply the participants with a robust description of the 
information need we created simulated work task situations 
according to the guidelines of a further advantage of 
using simulated tasks in this way rather than real-tasks 
is that some of the users will not have performed the task 
in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks 
that look for information of different temperatures if only 
real-tasks had been used all of the participants would have 
performed the tasks during the period of the diary study 
the created tasks were used in a final evaluation where 
we examined the email re-finding behaviour of users with 
three different email systems users in each group 
performed tasks each task of each type on each system 
using their own personal collections in a greco-latin square 
experimental design performing a pim evaluation in this 
way allowed the examination of re-finding behaviour in a 
way not possible before - we were able to observe the email 
re-finding strategies employed by real users performing 
realistic tasks on their own collections in a controlled 
environment the study revealed that the participants 
remembered different attributes of emails demostrated different 
finding behaviour and exhibited different levels of 
performance when asked to complete tasks of the different types 
in the taxonomy the key to both the task creation and the 
analysis of the results was our taxonomy which provided the 
template to create tasks and also a means to compare the 
behaviour and performance of different users and systems 
performing different tasks of the same type some of the 
findings of the evaluation will be published in 
summarising the approach to conduct a user experiment 
using our methodology researchers would be required to 
perform the following steps conduct a diary study as 
above 
 analyse the recorded tasks looking for overlap 
between the participants supplement the gained 
knowledge about the contents of participants collections by asking 
a selection of the participants to provide a tour of their 
collection use the knowledge gained to devise tasks of the 
three different types defined within the taxonomy more

 conclusions 
this paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties 
involved in performing pim evaluations the personal nature 
of pim means that it is difficult to construct balanced 
experiments because participants each have their own unique 
collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks 
we suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of 
pim in evaluations the performance of systems or users 
should be examined when users complete tasks on their own 
collections this approach itself has problems because task 
creation for personal collections is difficult researchers don t 
know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people 
perform and they don t know what information is within 
individual personal collections in this paper we described ways 
of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based pim 
user evaluations 
in the first part of the paper we performed a diary study 
that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email 
messages and web pages the collected data included a wide 
range of both work and non-work related tasks and based on 
the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding 
tasks we discovered that people perform three main types 
of re-finding task tasks that require specific information 
from within a single resource tasks that require a single 
complete resource and tasks that require information to be 
recovered from multiple resources in the second part of the 
paper we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with 
respect to pim evaluation we demonstrated that balanced 
experiments could be conducted comparing system or user 
performance on the task categories within the taxonomy 
we also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can 
be completed on personal collections these methods do 
not compromise the privacy of study participants we 
examined the techniques suggested firstly by simulating an 
experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform 
their own tasks as they recorded them and secondly in the 
context of a full evaluation performing evaluations in this 
way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve 
users ability to manage and re-find their information to be 
tested so that we can learn about the needs and desires 
of users thus this paper has offered two contributions to 
the field an increased understanding of pim behaviour at 
the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate 
further investigations
