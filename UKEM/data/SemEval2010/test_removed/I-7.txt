abstract 
making commitments e g through promises and threats enables a 
player to exploit the strengths of his own strategic position as well 
as the weaknesses of that of his opponents which commitments 
a player can make with credibility depends on the circumstances 
in some a player can only commit to the performance of an 
action in others he can commit himself conditionally on the actions 
of the other players some situations even allow for commitments 
on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions we 
explore the formal properties of these types of conditional 
commitment and their interrelationships so as to preclude 
inconsistencies among conditional commitments we assume an order in 
which the players make their commitments central to our 
analyses is the notion of an extortion which we define for a given order 
of the players as a profile that contains for each player an optimal 
commitment given the commitments of the players that committed 
earlier on this basis we investigate for different commitment types 
whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later and 
how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to backward 
induction and pareto efficiency

 introduction 
on one view the least one may expect of game theory is that 
it provides an answer to the question which actions maximize an 
agent s expected utility in situations of interactive decision making 
a slightly divergent view is expounded by schelling when he states 
that strategy is not concerned with the efficient application of 
force but with the exploitation of potential force page from 
this perspective the formal model of a game in strategic form only 
outlines the strategic features of an interactive situation apart from 
merely choosing and performing an action from a set of actions 
there may also be other courses open to an agent e g the strategic 
lie of the land may be such that a promise a threat or a combination 
of both would be more conductive to his ends 
the potency of a promise however essentially depends on the 
extent the promisee can be convinced of the promiser s resolve to 
see to its fulfillment likewise a threat only succeeds in deterring 
an agent if the latter can be made to believe that the threatener is 
bound to execute the threat should it be ignored in this sense 
promises and threats essentially involve a commitment on the part 
of the one who makes them thus purposely restricting his freedom 
of choice promises and threats epitomize one of the fundamental 
and at first sight perhaps most surprising phenomena in game 
theory it may occur that a player can improve his strategic position 
by limiting his own freedom of action by commitments we will 
understand such limitations of one s action space action itself could 
be seen as the ultimate commitment performing a particular action 
means doing so to the exclusion of all other actions 
commitments come in different forms and it may depend on the 
circumstances which ones can and which ones cannot credibly be 
made besides simply committing to the performance of an action 
an agent might make his commitment conditional on the actions 
of other agents as e g the kidnapper does when he promises to 
set free a hostage on receiving a ransom while threatening to cut 
off another toe otherwise some situations even allow for 
commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions 
by focusing on the selection of actions rather than on 
commitments it might seem that the conception of game theory as mere 
interactive decision theory is too narrow in this respect schelling s 
view might seem to evince a more comprehensive understanding of 
what game theory tries to accomplish one might object that 
commitments could be seen as the actions of a larger game in reply to 
this criticism schelling remarks 
while it is instructive and intellectually satisfying to 
see how such tactics as threats commitments and 
promises can be absorbed in an enlarged abstract 
supergame game in normal form it should be 
emphasized that we cannot learn anything about those 
tactics by studying games that are already in normal 
form what we want is a theory that systematizes 
the study of the various universal ingredients that make 
up the move-structure of games too abstract a model 
will miss them pp - 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
our concern is with these commitment tactics be it that our 
analysis is confined to situations in which the players can commit in 
a given order and where we assume the commitments the players 
can make are given despite schelling s warning for too abstract a 
framework our approach will be based on the formal notion of an 
extortion which we will propose in section as a uniform tactic 
for a comprehensive class of situations in which commitments can 
be made sequentially on this basis we tackle such issues as the 
usefulness of certain types of commitment in different situations 
 strategic games or whether it is better to commit early rather than 
late we also provide a framework for the assessment of more 
general game theoretic matters like the relationship of extortions to 
backward induction or pareto efficiency 
insight into these matters has proved itself invaluable for a proper 
understanding of diplomatic policy during the cold war 
nowadays we believe these issues are equally significant for 
applications and developments in such fields as multiagent systems 
distributed computing and electronic markets for example 
commitments have been argued to be of importance for interacting 
software agents as well as for mechanism design in the former setting 
the inability to re-program a software agent on the fly can be seen as 
a commitment to its specification and thus exploited to strengthen 
its strategic position in a multiagent setting a mechanism on the 
other hand could be seen as a set of commitments that steers the 
players behavior in a certain desired way see e g 
our analysis is conceptually similar to that of stackelberg or 
leadership games which have been extensively studied in the 
economic literature cf these games analyze situations in 
which a leader commits to a pure or mixed strategy and a number 
of followers who then act simultaneously our approach however 
differs in that it is assumed that the players all move in a 
particular order-first second third and so on-and that it is specifically 
aimed at incorporating a wide range of possible commitments in 
particular conditional commitments 
after briefly discussing related work in section we present 
the formal game theoretic framework in which we define the 
notions of a commitment type as well as conditional and unconditional 
commitments section in section we propose the generic 
concept of an extortion which for each commitment type captures the 
idea of an optimal commitment profile we point out an 
equivalence between extortions and backward induction solutions and 
investigate whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than 
later and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to 
pareto efficiency section briefly reviews some other 
commitment types such as inductive mixed and mixed conditional 
commitments the paper concludes with an overview of the results and 
an outlook for future research in section

commitment is a central concept in game theory the 
possibility to make commitments distinguishes cooperative from 
noncooperative game theory leadership games as mentioned 
in the introduction analyze commitments to pure or mixed 
strategies in what is essentially a two-player setting informally 
schelling has emphasized the importance of promises threats 
and the like for a proper understanding of social interaction on a 
more formal level threats have also figured in bargaining theory 
nash s threat game and harsanyi s rational threats are two 
important early examples also commitments have played a 
significant role in the theory of equilibrium selection see e g 
over the last few years game theory has become almost 
indispensable as a research tool for computer science and multi agent 
research commitments have by no means gone unnoticed see

figure committing to a dominated strategy can be 
advantageous 
e g recently also the strategic aspects of commitments 
have attracted the attention of computer scientists thus conitzer 
and sandholm have studied the computational complexity of 
computing the optimal strategy to commit to in normal form and 
bayesian games sandholm and lesser employ levelled 
commitments for the design of multiagent systems in which 
contractual agreements are not fully binding another connection 
between commitments and computer science has been pointed out 
by samet and tennenholtz their point of departure is the 
observation that programs can be used to formulate commitments 
that are conditional on the programs of other systems 
our approach is similar to the stackleberg setting in that we 
assume an order in which the players commit we however consider 
a number of different commitment types among which conditional 
commitments and propose a generic solution concept 
 commitments 
by committing an agent can improve his strategic position it 
may even be advantageous to commit to a strategy that is strongly 
dominated i e one for which there is another strategy that yields 
a better payoff no matter how the other agents act consider for 
example the × game in figure in which one player row chooses 
rows and another col chooses columns the entries in the matrix 
indicate the payoffs to row and col respectively then top-left 
is the solution obtained by iterative elimination of strongly 
dominated strategies for row playing top is always better than playing 
bottom and assuming that row will therefore never play bottom 
left is always better than right for col however if row succeeds 
in convincing col of his commitment to play bottom the latter had 
better choose the right column thus row attains a payoff of two 
instead of one along a similar line of reasoning however col 
would wish to commit to the left column as convincing row of 
this commitment guarantees him the most desirable outcome if 
on the other hand both players actually commit themselves in this 
way but without convincing the other party of their having done so 
the game ends in misery for both 
important types of commitments however cannot simply be 
analyzed as unconditional commitments to actions the essence of a 
threat for example is deterrence if successful it is not carried out 
 this is also the reason why the credibility of a threat is not 
necessarily undermined if its putting into effect means that the threatener 
is also harmed by contrast promises are made to entice and as 
such meant to be fulfilled thus both threats and promises would 
be strategically void if they were unconditional 
figure shows an example in which col can guarantee himself 
a payoff of three by threatening to choose the right column if row 
chooses top this will suffice to deter row and there is no need 
for an additional promise on the part of col he cannot do so by 
merely committing unconditionally and neither can row if he were 
to commit first 
in the case of conditional commitments however a particular 
kind of inconsistency can arise it is not in general the case that 
any two commitments can both be credible in a × game it 
could occur that row commits conditionally on playing top if the

figure the column player col can guarantee himself a payoff of 
three by threatening to play right if the row player row plays top 
col plays left and bottom otherwise if now col simultaneously 
were able to commit to the conditional strategy to play right if row 
plays top and left otherwise there is no strategy profile that can 
be played without one of the players bluff being called 
to get around this problem one can write down conditional 
commitments in the form of rules and define appropriate fixed point 
constructions as suggested by samet and tennenholtz 
since checking the semantic equivalence of two commitments or 
commitment conditions is undecidable in general tennenholtz 
bases his definition of program equilibrium on syntactic 
equivalence we by contrast try to steer clear from fixed point 
constructions by assuming that the players make their commitment in 
a particular order each player can then make his commitments 
dependent on the actions of the players to commit after him but not 
on the commitments of the players that committed before on the 
issue how this order comes about we do not here enter rather we 
assume it to be determined by the circumstances which may force 
or permit some players to commit earlier and others later we will 
find that it is not always beneficial to commit earlier than later or 
vice versa 
another point to heed is that we only consider the case in which 
the commitments are considered absolutely binding we do not 
take into account commitments that can be violated intuitively 
this could be understood as that the possibility of violation fatally 
undermines the credibility of the commitment we also assume 
commitments to be complete in the sense that they fully lay down a 
player s behavior in all foreseeable circumstances these 
assumptions imply that the outcome of the game is entirely determined by 
the commitments the players make although these might be 
implausible assumptions for some situations we had better study the 
idealized case first before tackling the complications of the more 
general case to make these concepts formally precise we first 
have to fix some notation 
 strategic games 
a strategic game is a tuple n ai i∈n ui i∈n where n 
 n is a finite set of players ai is a set of actions available 
to player i and ui a real-valued utility function for player i on the 
set of pure strategy profiles s a ×· · ·×an we call a game finite 
if for all players i the action set ai is finite a mixed strategy σi for 
a player i is a probability distribution over ai we write σi for the 
set of mixed strategies available to player i and σ σ × · · · × σn 
for the set of mixed strategy profiles we further have σ a and 
σi a denote the probability of action a in mixed strategy profile σ 
or mixed strategy σi respectively in settings involving expected 
utility we will generally assume that utility functions represent 
von neumann-morgenstern preferences for a player i and mixed 
strategy profiles σ and τ we write σ i τ if ui σ ui τ 
 conditional commitments 
relative to a strategic game n ai i∈n ui i∈n and an 
ordering π π πn of the players we define the set fπi 
of pure 
conditional commitments of a player πi as the set of functions 
from aπ 
× · · · × aπi− 
to aπi 
 for π we have the set of conditional 
commitments coincide with aπ 
 by a conditional commitment 
profile f we understand any combination of conditional commitments 
in fπ 
× · · · × fπn 
intuitively π reflects the sequential order in which the players 
can make their commitments with πn committing first πn− second 
and so on each player can condition his action on the actions of 
all players that are to commit after him in this manner each 
conditional commitment profile f can be seen to determine a unique 
strategy profile denoted by f which will be played if all players 
stick to their conditional commitments more formally the strategy 
profile f fπ 
 fπn 
 for a conditional commitment profile f is 
defined inductively as 
fπ 
 df fπ 
 
fπi 
 df fπi 
 fπ 
 fπi 
 
the sequence fπ 
 fπ 
 fπ 
 fπ 
 fπn 
 will be called the path 
of f e g in the two-player game of figure and given the 
order row col row has two conditional commitments top and 
bottom which we will henceforth denote t and b col on the other 
hand has four conditional commitments corresponding to the 
different functions mapping strategies of row to those of col if we 
consider a conditional commitment f for col such that f t l 
and f b r then t f is a conditional commitment profile 
and t f t f t t l 
there is a natural way in which a strategic game g together with 
an ordering π πn of the players can be interpreted as an 
extensive form game with perfect information see e g 
 in 
which π chooses his action first π second and so on observe 
that under this assumption the strategies in the extensive form game 
and the conditional commitments in the strategic game g with 
ordering π are mathematically the same objects applying backward 
induction to the extensive form game yields subgame perfect 
equilibria which arguably provide appropriate solutions in this setting 
from the perspective of conditional commitments however 
players move in reverse order we will argue that under this 
interpretation other strategy profiles should be singled out as appropriate 
to illustrate this point consider once more the game in figure 
and observe that neither player can improve on the outcome 
obtained via iterated strong dominance by committing 
unconditionally to some strategy situations like this in which players can 
make unconditional commitments in a fixed order can fruitfully 
be analyzed as extensive form games and the most lucrative 
unconditional commitment can be found through backward induction 
figure shows the extensive form associated with the game of 
figure the strategies available to the row player are the same as in 
the strategic form choosing the top or the bottom row the 
strategies for the column player in the extensive game are given by the 
four functions that map strategies of the row player in the 
strategic game to one of his own transforming this extensive form 
back into a strategic game see figure we find that there exists 
a second equilibrium besides the one found by means of backward 
induction this equilibrium with outcome indicated by the 
thick lines in figure has been argued to be unacceptable in the 
sequential game as it would involve an incredible threat by col 
once row has played top col finds himself confronted with a fait 
accompli he had better make the best of a bad bargain and opt 
for the left column after all this is in essence the line of thought 
selten followed in his famous argument for subgame perfect 
equilibria if however the strategies of col in the extensive form 
are thought of as his conditional commitments he can make in case 
 
for a formal definition of a game in extensive form the reader 
consult one of the standard textbooks such as or in this 
paper all formal definitions are based on strategic games and 
orderings of the players only

figure extensive form obtained from the strategic game of 
figure when the row player chooses an action first the backward 
induction solution is indicated by dashed lines the conditional 
commitment solution by solid ones the horizontal dotted lines do not 
indicate information sets but merely indicate which players are to 
move when 
he moves first the situation is radically different thus we also 
assume that it is possible for col to make credible the threat to choose 
the right column if row were to play top so as to ensure the latter is 
always better off to play the bottom row if col can make a 
conditional commitment of playing the right column if row chooses top 
and the left column otherwise this leaves row with the easy choice 
between a payoff of zero or one and col may expect a payoff of 
three 
this line of reasoning can be generalized to yield an 
algorithm for finding optimal conditional commitments for general

 and continue with 
step 
generalizing the idea underlying this algorithm we present in 
section the concept of an extortion which applies to games with 
any number of players for any order of the players an extortion 
contains for each player an optimal commitment given the 
commitments of the players that committed earlier 
 commitment types 
so far we have distinguished between conditional and 
unconditional commitments if made sequentially both of them determine 
a unique strategy profile in a given strategic game this notion of 
sequential commitment allows for generalization and gives rise to 
the following definition of a sequential commitment type 
definition sequential commitment type a 
 sequential commitment type τ associates with each strategic game g 
and each ordering π of its players a tuple xπ 
 xπn φ 
where xπ 
 xπn are abstract sets of commitments and φ is a 
function mapping each profile in x xπ 
× · · · × xπn to a mixed 
strategy profile of g a commitment type xπ 
 xπn φ is finite 
whenever xπi 
is finite for each i with i n 
thus the type of unconditional commitments associates with a 
game and an ordering π of its players the tuple s π

where id is the identity function similarly fπ 
 fπn is the 
tuple associated with the same game by the type of pure 
conditional commitments 
 extortions 
in the introduction we argued informally how players could 
improve their position by conditionally committing how well they 
can do could be analyzed by means of an extensive game with the 
actions of each player being defined as the possible commitments 
he can make here we introduce for each commitment type a 
corresponding notion of extortion which is defined relative to a 
strategic game and an ordering of the players extortions are meant to 
capture the concept of a profile that contains for each player an 
optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that 
committed earlier a complicating factor is that in finding a player s 
optimal commitment one should not only take into account how 
such a commitment affects other players actions but also how it 
enables them to make their commitments 
definition extortions let g be a strategic game π an 
ordering of its players and τ a commitment type let τ g π be 
given by xπ 
 xπn φ a τ-extortion of order is any 
commitment profile x ∈ xπ 
× · · · × xπn for m a commitment 
profile x ∈ xπ 
× · · · × xπn is a τ-extortion of order m in g given π 
if x is an τ-extortion of order m − with 
φ yπ 
 yπm xπm 
 xπn πm φ xπ 
 xπm xπm 
 xπn 
for all commitment profiles g in x with yπ 
 yπm xπm 
 xπn 
a τ-extortion of order m − a τ-extortion is a commitment profile 
that is a τ-extortion of order m for all m with m n 
furthermore we say that a mixed strategy profile σ is τ-extortionable if 
there is some τ-extortion x with φ x s 
thus an extortion of order is a commitment profile in which 
player π makes a commitment that maximizes his payoff given 
fixed commitments of the other players an extortion of order m is 
an extortion of order m − that maximizes player m s payoff given 
fixed commitments of the players πm through πn 
for the type of conditional commitments we have that any 
conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order and an 
extortion of an order m greater than is any extortion of order m −

commitments consider the three-player game in figure and assume

figure a conditional extortion f of order left and an extortion g of order right 
 row col mat to be the order in which the players commit 
figure depicts the possible conditional commitments of the players 
in extensive forms with the left branch corresponding to row s 
strategy of playing the top row let f and g be the conditional 
commitment strategies indicated by the thick lines in the left and 
right figures respectively both f and g are extortions of order 
in both f and g row guarantees himself the higher payoff given 
the conditional commitments of mat and col only g however is 
also an extortion of order to appreciate that f is not consider 
the conditional commitment profile h in which row chooses top 
and col chooses right no matter how row decides i e h is such 
that hrow t and hcol t hcol b r then hrow hcol fmat is 
also an extortion of order but yields col a higher payoff than f 
does we leave it to the reader to check that by contrast g is an 
extortion of order and therewith an extortion per se 
 promises and threats 
one way of understanding conditional extortions is by 
conceiving of them as combinations of precisely one promise and a 
number of threats from the strategy profiles that can still be realized 
given the conditional commitments of players that have 
committed before him a player tries to enforce the strategy profile that 
yields him as much payoff as possible hence he chooses his 
commitment so as to render deviations from the path that leads to this 
strategy profile as unattractive as possible  threats and the 
desired strategy profile as appealing as possible  promises for the 
relevant players if sπ 
 sπn is such a desirable strategy 
profile for player πi and fπi 
his conditional commitment the value 
of fπi 
 sπ 
 sπi− 
 could be taken as his promise whereas the 
values of fπi 
for all other tπ 
 tπi− 
 could be seen as constituting 
his threats the higher the payoff is to the other players in a strategy 
profile a player aims for the easier it is for him to formulate an 
effective threat however making appropriate threats in this respect 
does not merely come down to minimizing the payoffs to players to 
commit later wherever possible a player should also take into 
account the commitments promises and threats the following players 
can make on the basis of his and his predecessors commitments 
this is what makes extortionate reasoning sometimes so 
complicated especially in situations with more than two players 
for example in the game of figure there is no conditional 
extortion that ensures mat a payoff of two to appreciate this 
consider the possible commitments mat can make in case row plays 
top and col plays left tl and in case row plays top and col plays 
right tr if mat commits to the right matrix in both cases he 
virtually promises row a payoff of four leaving himself with a payoff of 
at most one otherwise he puts col in a position to deter row from 
choosing bottom by threatening to choose the right column if the 
latter does so again mat cannot expect a payoff higher than one 
in short no matter how mat conditionally commits he will either 
enable col to threaten row into playing top or fail to lure row into 
playing the bottom row 
 benign backward induction 
the solutions extortions provide can also be obtained by 
modeling the situation as an extensive form game and applying a 
backward inductive type of argument the actions of the players in any 
such extensive form game are then given by their conditional 
commitments which they then choose sequentially for higher types 
of commitment such as conditional commitments such 
 metagames however grow exponentially in the number of strategies 
available to the players and are generally much larger than the 
original game the correspondence between the backward induction 
solutions in the meta-game and the extortions of the original 
strategic game rather signifies that the concept of an extortion is defined 
properly first we define the concept of benign backward 
induction in general relative to a game in strategic form together with 
an ordering of the players intuitively it reflects the idea that each 
player chooses for each possible combination of actions of his 
predecessors the action that yields the highest payoff given that his 
successors do similarly the concept is called benign backward 
induction because it implies that a player when indifferent between 
a number of actions chooses the one that benefits his 
predecessors most for an ordering π of the players we have πr 
denote its 
reversal πn π 
definition benign backward induction let g be a 
strategic game and π an ordering of its players a benign 
backward induction of order is any conditional commitment profile f 
subject to π for m a conditional commitment strategy 
profile f is a benign backward induction solution of order m if f is a

of each player i given by his τ-commitments xi in g the utility 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
of a strategy profile xπ 
 xπn for a player i in g 
can then be 
equated to his utility of the strategy profile φ xπn xπ 
 in g we 
now find that the extortions of g can be retrieved as the paths of 
the benign backward induction solutions of the game g 
for the 
ordering πr

finite 
theorem let g n ai i∈n ui i∈n be a game and π

proof assume that f is a benign backward induction in g

 then f xπn xπ 
 for some commitment 
profile xπ 
 xπn of g relative to π we show by induction 
that xπ 
 xπn is an extortion of order m for all m with 
m n for m the proof is trivial for the induction step 
consider an arbitrary commitment profile yπ 
 yπn such that 
 yπ

 xπn is an extortion of order m − in virtue 
of the induction hypothesis there is a benign backward induction g

 then also

we may conclude that x is an extortion of order m 
for the only if direction assume that x is an extortion of g 
given π we prove that there is a benign backward induction f 
in g 
for πr 
with f 
 x in virtue of fact there is a benign 
backward induction h in g 
given πr 
 now define f 
in such a way 
that f

 zπn zπi− 
 otherwise we prove 
by induction on m that f 
is a benign backward induction of 
order m for each m with m n the basis is trivial so 
assume that f 
is a backward induction of order m − in g 
given πr 
and consider an arbitrary benign backward induction g 
of order m − in g 
given πr 
 let g be given by yπn yπ 
 
either yπn yπm

the latter it can readily be appreciated that

 hence f 
is 
a benign backward induction of order m in the former case 
the reasoning is slightly different then gπn gπ

in virtue of the induction hypothesis yπ 
 yπn is an extortion

assumption that x is an extortion in g given π we also have 
φ yπ 
 yπm xπm 
 xπn πm φ xπ

then xπn xπm

signifying that f 
is a benign backward induction of order m 
as an immediate consequence of theorem and fact we also 
have the following result 
corollary let τ be a finite commitment type then 
τ-extortions exist for each strategic game and for each ordering 
of the players 
 commitment order 
in the case of unconditional commitments it is not always 
favorable to be the first to commit this is well illustrated by the familiar 
game rock-paper-scissors if on the other hand the players are in a 
position to make conditional commitments in this particular game 
moving first is an advantage rather we find that it can never harm 
to move first in a two-player game with conditional commitments 
theorem let g be a two-player strategic game involving 
player i further let f be an extortion of g in which i commits first 
and g an extortion in which i commits second then g i f 
proof sketch let f be a conditional extortion in g given π it 
suffices to show that there is some conditional extortion h of 
order in g given π with h f assume for a contradiction that 
there is no such extortion of order in g given π then there must 
be some b 
∈ aj such that f ≺j b 
 a for all a ∈ ai 
 otherwise we could define gj gi such that gj fj fi gi gj fi 
and for any other b ∈ aj gi b a 
 where a 
is an action in ai 
such that b a 
 j f then g would be an extortion of order 
in g given π with g now consider a conditional commitment 
profile h for g and π such that hj a b 
 for all a ∈ ai let 
further hi be such that a hj i hi hj for all a ∈ ai then h is an 
extortion of order in g given π observe that hi hj fi b 
 
hence f ≺j h contradicting the assumption that f is an extortion 
in g given π 
theorem does not generalize to games with more than two 
players consider the three-player game in figure with 
extensive forms as in figure here row and mat have identical 
preferences the latter s extortionate powers relative col however are 
very weak if he is to commit first any conditional commitment 
he makes puts col in a situation in which she can enforce a 
payoff of two leaving mat and row in the cold with a payoff of one 
however if mat is last to commit and row first then the latter can 
exploit his strategic powers threaten col so that she plays left and 
guarantee both himself and mat a payoff of two 
 pareto efficiency 
another issue concerns the pareto efficiency of the strategy 
profiles extortionable through conditional commitments we say that 
a strategy profile s weakly pareto dominates another strategy 
profile t if t i s for all players i and s it for some moreover a 
strategy profile s is weakly pareto efficient if it is not weakly 
pareto dominated by any other strategy profile we extend this 
terminology to conditional commitment profiles by saying that a 
conditional commitment profile f is weakly pareto efficient or 
 weakly pareto dominates another conditional commitment profile 
if f is or does so we now have the following result

figure it is not always better to commit early than late even in the case of conditional or inductive commitments 
theorem in each game pareto efficient conditional 
extortions exist moreover any strategy profile that pareto dominates an 
extortion is also extortionable through a conditional commitment 
proof sketch since in virtue of fact extortions 
generally exists in each game it suffices to recognize that the second 
claim holds let s be the strategy profile sπ 
 sπn let 
further the conditional extortion f be pareto dominated by s an 
extortion g with g s can then be constructed by adopting 
all threats of f while promising g i e for all players πi we 
have gπi 
 sπ 
 sπi− 
 si and gπi 
 tπ 
 tπn fπi 
 tπ 
 tπn 
for all other tπ 
 tπn as s pareto dominates f the threats of f 
remain effective as threats of g given that s is being promised 
this result hints at a difference between benign backward 
induction and extortions in general solutions of benign backward 
inductions can be pareto dominated by outcomes that are no benign 
backward induction solutions therefore although every extortion 
can be seen as a benign backward induction in a larger game it is 
not the case that all formal properties of extortions are shared by 
benign backward inductions in general 
 other commitment types 
conditional and unconditional commitments are only two 
possible commitment types the definition also provides for types 
of commitment that allow for committing on commitments thus 
achieving a finer adjustment of promises and threats similarly it 
subsumes commitments on and to mixed strategies in this section 
we comment on some of these possibilities 
 inductive commitments 
apart from making commitments conditional on the actions of 
the players to commit later one could also commit on the 
commitments of the following players informally such commitments 
would have the form of if you only dare to commit in such and 
such a way then i do such and such otherwise i promise to act so 
and so 
for a strategic game g and an ordering π of the players we 
define the inductive commitments of the players inductively the 
inductive commitments available to π coincide with the actions that 
are available to him an inductive commitment for player πi is a 
function mapping each profile of inductive commitments of 
players π through πi to one of his basic actions formally we define the 
type of inductive commitments fπ 
 fπn such that for each 
player πi in a game g and given π 
fπ 
 df aπ 
 
fπi 
 df a 
fπ ×···×fπi 
πi 
 
let fπi 
 fπi 
fπ 
 fπi− 
 for each player πi and have f denote 
the pure strategy profile fπ 
 fπn 
 
inductive commitments have a greater extortionate power than 
conditional commitments to appreciate this consider once more 
the game in figure we found that the strategy profile in 
which row chooses bottom and col and mat both choose left is 
not extortionable through conditional commitments by means of 
inductive commitments however this is possible let f be the 
inductive commitment profile such that frow is row choosing the 
bottom row b fcol is the column player choosing the left column 
 l no matter how row decides and fmat is defined such that 
fmat frow fcol 
⎧ 
⎪⎪⎨ 
⎪⎪⎩ 
r if frow t and fcol b r 
l otherwise 
instead of showing formally that f is an inductive extortion of the 
strategy profile b l l we point out informally how this can be 
done we argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of 
a conditional extortion mat would have to lure row into choosing 
the bottom row without at the same time putting col in a position 
to successfully threaten row not to choose top this we found 
is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional 
commitments by contrast if mat can commit to commitments he can 
undermine col s efforts to threaten row by playing the right 
matrix if col were to do so yet mat can still force row to choose 
the bottom row in case col desists form making this threat 
as can readily be observed in any game the inductive 
commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their 
conditional commitments hence as an immediate consequence 
of theorem it can never harm to be the first to commit to 
an inductive commitment in the two player case similarly we 
find that the game depicted in figure also serves as an example 
showing that in case there are more than two players it is not 
always better to commit to an inductive commitment early in this 
example the strategic position of mat is so weak if he is to 
commit first that even the possibility to commit inductively does not 
strengthen it whereas in a similar fashion as with conditional 
commitments row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and mat 
if he is the first to commit 
 mixed commitments types 
so far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure 
strategies a natural extension would be also to consider 
commitments to and on mixed strategies we distinguish between 
conditional unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments 
we find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure 
counterparts in some situations a player can achieve more using 
a mixed commitment in another using a pure commitment type 
a complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
can result in a mixed strategy profile being played this makes 
that the distinction between promises and threats as delineated in 
section gets blurred for mixed commitment types 
the type of mixed unconditional commitments associates 
with each game g and ordering π of its players the 
tuple σπ 
 σπn id the two-player case has been extensively 
studied e g as a matter of fact von neumann s 
famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games 
it does not matter which player commits first if the second player 
to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level the 
first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well 
in the game of figure we found that with conditional 
commitments mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a 
payoff of two recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to 
deter row from choosing the top row is flawed as it would put col 
in an excellent position to threaten row not to choose the bottom 
row if mat has inductive commitments at his disposal however 
this is a possibility we now find that in case the players can 
dispose of unconditional mixed strategies mat is in a much similar 
position he could randomize uniformly between the left and right 
matrix then row s expected utility is 
 
if he plays the top row 
no matter how col randomizes the expected payoff of col does 
not exceed 
 
 either in case row chooses top by purely 
committing to the left column col player entices row to play bottom 
as his expected utility then amounts to this ensures an expected 
utility of three for col as well 
however a player is not always better off with unconditional 
mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments for 
an example consider the game in figure using pure conditional 
commitments he can ensure a payoff of three whereas with 
unconditional mixed commitments 
 
would be the most he could 
achieve neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a 
mixed strategy in a three-player game to appreciate this consider 
once more the game in figure again committing to a mixed 
strategy will not achieve much for mat if he is to move first and as 
before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other 
than a pure strategy this holds for all players if row commits first 
col second and mat last be it that in this case mat obtains the best 
payoff he can get 
analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can 
also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive 
commitments with the former a player can condition his mixed 
strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him 
these tend to be very large objects and knowing little about them 
yet we shelve their formal analysis for future research 
conceptually it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional 
commitments can be made with credibility for one when one s 
commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being 
played how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed 
strategy that was played rather than another one if this proves to be 
impossible how can one know how his conditional commitments 
is to be effectuated a possible answer would be that all depends 
on the circumstances in which the commitments were made e g 
if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional 
commitments to an independent party the latter can execute the 
randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their 
commitments induce 
 summary and conclusion 
in some situations agents can strengthen their strategic position 
by committing themselves to a particular course of action there 
are various types of commitment e g pure mixed and conditional 
which type of commitment an agent is in a position in to make 
essentially depends on the situation under consideration if the agents 
commit in a particular order there is a tactic common to making 
commitments of any type which we have formalized by means the 
concept of an extortion this generic concept of extortion can be 
analyzed in abstracto moreover on its basis the various 
commitment types can be compared formally and systematically 
we have seen that the type of commitment an agent can make 
has a profound impact on what an agent can achieve in a 
gamelike situation in some situations a player is much helped if he 
is in a position to commit conditionally whereas in others mixed 
commitments would be more profitable this raises the question 
as to the characteristic formal features of the situations in which it 
is advantageous for a player to be able to make commitments of a 
particular type 
another issue which we leave for future research is the 
computational complexity of finding an extortion for the different 
commitment types
