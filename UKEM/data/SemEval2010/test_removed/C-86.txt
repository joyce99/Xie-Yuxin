 introduction 
market-based systems have long been proposed as 
solutions for resource allocation in distributed systems including 
computational grids wide-area network testbeds 
and peer-to-peer systems yet while the theoretical 
underpinnings of market-based schemes have made significant 
strides in recent years practical integration of market-based 
mechanisms into real computer systems and empirical 
observations of such systems under real workloads has remained 
an elusive goal towards this end we have designed 
implemented and deployed a microeconomic resource allocation 
system called mirage for scheduling testbed time on a 
 -node wireless sensor network sensornet testbed at 
intel research the system which employs a repeated 
combinatorial auction to schedule allocations has been in 
production use for over four months and has scheduled over 
 node hours across research projects to date 
in designing and deploying mirage we had three primary 
goals first we wanted to validate whether a market-based 
resource allocation scheme was necessary at all an 
economic problem only exists when resources are scarce 
therefore a key goal was to first measure both resource 
contention and the range of underlying valuations users place 
on the resources during periods of resource scarcity 
second we wanted to observe how users would actually behave 
in a market-based environment much of economic theory is 
predicated on rational user behavior which forms the basis 
for motivating research efforts such as strategyproof 
mechanism design with mirage we wanted to 
observe to what extent rationality held and in what ways 
users would attempt to strategize and game the system 
finally we wanted to identify what other practical problems 
would emerge in a deployment of a market based system in 
this paper we report briefly on our first goal while focusing 
primarily on the second the third is left for future work 
empirical results based on four months of usage have 
validated the key motivating factors in using an auction-based 
scheme i e significant resource contention and widely 
varying valuations but have also pointed to real-world 
observations of strategic user behavior in deploying mirage we 
made the early decision to base the system on a repeated 
combinatorial auction known not to be strategyproof that 
is self-interested users could attempt to increase their 
personal gain at the expense of others by not revealing their 
true value to the system we made this decision mainly 
because designing a strategyproof mechanism remains an open 
challenging problem and we wanted to deploy a working 
system and gain experience with real users to address our three 
goals in a timely manner deploying a non-strategyproof 
mechanism also had the benefit of testing rationality and 
seeing how and to what extent users would try to game the 
system the key contribution of this paper is an analysis of 
such strategic behavior as observed over a four-month time 
period and proposed refinements for mitigating such 
behavior en route to building an approximately strategyproof 
repeated combinatorial auction 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 
 
we present an overview of mirage including high-level 
observations on usage over a four-month period in section we 
examine strategic user behavior focusing on the four 
primary types of strategies employed by users in the system 
based on these results section presents a set of key 
challenges for market-based resource allocation systems based 
on repeated combinatorial auctions as a first step in 
addressing some of these challenges we describe refinements 
to mirage s current auction scheme that mitigate the 
strategies observed to date and also comment on some initial steps 
towards building an approximately strategyproof repeated 
combinatorial auction for mirage finally in section we 
conclude the paper 
 the mirage system 
sensornet testbeds are a critical tool for developing and 
evaluating sensornet technology in a controlled and 
instrumented environment as with many large-scale systems 
however resource management is a key problem given that 
it is not economical for users to each build and operate their 
own testbed in mirage testbed resources are 
spaceshared and allocated using a repeated combinatorial auction 
in a closed virtual currency environment users compete for 
testbed resources by submitting bids which specify resource 
combinations of interest in space time e g any mica 
motes for hours anytime in the next two days along with 
a maximum value amount the user is willing to pay a 
combinatorial auction is then periodically run to determine the 
winning bids based on supply and demand while maximizing 
aggregate utility delivered to users

in mirage resources are allocated using a first-price 
combinatorial auction which clears every hour in each round 
of the auction a rolling window of future testbed resources 
is available for allocation with subsets of that window 
being removed from the pool as resources get allocated in 
our initial deployment we used a -hour window and 
deployed the system on a testbed consisting of nodes 
mica and mica dot sensor nodes or motes 
in each round of the auction users bid for subsets of 
resources available in the current window when the system 
is first brought online a full -node × -hour window 
is available where each row of the window represents the 
availability of a particular node across time and each 
column represents the availability of the testbed for a given 
hour the leftmost column of the window represents node 
availability for the hour immediately following the auction 
these node hours will never again be available for auction 
all other node hours not allocated at this or previous 
auctions continue to be offered for sale at subsequent auctions 
in each subsequent round i e every hour portions of the 
current window are allocated as bids are matched to 
available resources and a new rightmost -node × -hour 
column of resources rolls in and replaces the leftmost column of 
resources which expires there is no time sharing of nodes 
given limited local computation and communication power 
once a sensor is allocated to a user for a particular time 
period it is unavailable to all other users 
in mirage users place combinatorial bids specifying 
resource combinations of interest in space time along with a 
maximum value amount the user is willing to pay more 
specifically a bid bi vi si ti di fmin fmax ni oki 
indicates the user wants any combination of ni motes from 
the set oki simultaneously for a duration of di hours di ∈ 
 a start time anywhere between si and ti and 
a radio frequency in the range fmin fmax 
the user also 
is willing to pay up to vi units of virtual currency for these 
resources in essence each bid specifies in a succinct 
manner what subsets of the resource window would serve as 
acceptable resources that meet the user s constraints and how 
important the desired resource allocation is to the user 
we deployed mirage on december and the system 
has been in continuous production use for over four months 
in the process its lifetime has overlapped with several 
periods of significant resource contention including the 
sigcomm and sensys conference deadlines overall 
the system has research projects registered to use the 
system spanning a variety of academic and commercial 
institutions of these have actively bid and received time 
on the system as of april the system has received 
 bids and allocated node hours over the testbed s

plots distributions of bid values per node hour for the seven 
most active users in the system this graph shows that 
user valuations for testbed resources varied substantially 
spanning over four orders of magnitude valuations are also 
distributed relatively evenly across each order of magnitude 
suggesting that these ranges are not due to a few anomalous 
bids but rather to a wide range of underlying user valuations 
for testbed resources these dual observations-significant 
resource contention and a wide range of valuations-support 
the use of an auction which is designed precisely to harness 
such widely varying valuations to compute an efficient and 
user utility-maximizing node allocation 
lastly as another measure of resource contention and the 
utility of driving resource allocation via user-specified 
valuations figure plots the median per-node clearing price for 
both mica and mica dot motes over time to compute 
these prices we price an allocated node-hour for a winning 
bid with value v for n nodes for k hours as v nk unallocated 
node-hours are assigned a price of for a given hour we 
examine all mica motes and plot the median node-hour 
price for that hour and do the same for mica dot motes 
of particular interest in this graph are the sequence of prices 
from days - and days - i e periods leading up 
to conference deadlines these sequences show that the 
value of testbed resources as measured by market prices for 
motes increases exponentially logarithmic y-axis during 
times of peak contention this suggests that allowing users 
to express valuations for resources to drive the resource 
allocation process is important for making effective use of the 
testbed e g to distinguish important use from low 
priority activities however it also suggests that users become 
exponentially desperate to acquire resources as deadlines 
approach as it turns out it is precisely during these times 
that users will try their hardest to game the system and 
therefore when the efficacy of a market-based mechanism 
can be best evaluated

 observed strategic behavior 
during the past four months of operation mirage has 
employed two distinct auction mechanisms and observed four 
primary types of strategic behavior from users the first 
auction mechanism a was deployed from december 
 to march during this time period we 
observed three different types of strategic behavior s -s 
the most recent of which s resulted in significant gaming 
of the system in response to the impact of s we deployed 
a second mechanism a on march day in 
figures and while a mitigated or eliminated the 
known shortcomings of a -in particular the vulnerability 
strategy s exploited that prompted the change in the first 
place-it was soon discovered that a remained vulnerable 
to another strategy s which was predictably discovered 
and exploited by a motivated user community we are 
currently in the process of designing a mechanism to address the 
weakness in a that is abused by s of course ideally we 
would develop a provably strategyproof mechanism 
however this remains an open research problem for repeated 
combinatorial auctions 
in this section we describe the two auction mechanisms 
a and a mirage s virtual currency policy the four types 
of observed strategic behavior s -s and their impact on 
aggregate utility delivered 
 auctions and virtual currency 
our first auction mechanism a was a first-price 
openbid i e users can see all outstanding bids from competing 
users combinatorial auction that cleared every hour based 
on a greedy algorithm in each round of auction the current 
set of bids was sorted by value per node hour and bids were 
greedily fit into the remaining portion of the current window 
of available resources like a our second auction a was 
also based on a greedy clearing algorithm its key differences 
were that i it was a sealed-bid auction and ii it allocated 
resources over a -node × -hour window with bid start 
times constrained to be within the next hours the reason 
for this will become apparent when we discuss strategy s 
in both auctions winning bids from previous auctions 
were publicly visible for price feedback and the same 
virtual currency policy was used our virtual currency policy 
assigns two numbers to each user s bank account a baseline 
value and a number of shares when created each bank 
account is initialized to its baseline value once funded a user 
can then begin to bid and acquire testbed resources through 
mirage in each round of the auction accounts for winning 
bids are debited and the proceeds are redistributed through 
a proportional profit-sharing policy based on bank account 
share values the primary purpose of this policy is to 
reward users who refrain from using the system during times 
of peak demand and penalize those who use resources 
aggressively during periods of scarcity these rewards result 
in transient bursts of credit and are balanced by another 
mechanism a savings tax to prevent idle users from sitting 
on large amounts of excess credit forever a use it or lose 
it policy in our deployment an administrator set the 
virtual currency policy bank accounts for external users were 
assigned baseline and shares value set to while bank 
accounts for internal users u and u were assigned larger 
allocations with baseline and share values set to 
 strategic behavior 
the following are descriptions of the four primary bidding 
strategies observed over the past four-months 
s underbidding based on current demand in a all 
outstanding bids were publicly visible consequently when 
users would observe a lack of demand some users would bid 
correspondingly low amounts rather than their true values 
for example one user would frequently bid or when no 
other bids were present while underbidding in the absence 
of competition is not a problem per se it does raise two 
 
issues first if a seller was collecting revenue for profit 
such bidding leads to suboptimal outcomes for the seller 
second should other users enter competing bids before the 
auction clears users will need to refine their bids to allow the 
system to compute an allocation that maximizes aggregate 
utility this second problem then leads to strategy s 
s iterative bidding because users are allowed to modify 
their bids and a was an open auction iteratively refining 
one s bid value in response to other users bid values should 
in theory have no effect on who wins the auction users 
with higher valuations-who may also be 
underbiddingshould eventually outbid those with lower valuations after 
sufficient iteration the problem is that users do not 
behave this rational way usability overhead matters users 
in mirage bid once and perhaps modify their bid a second 
time the end result is that inefficiencies may arise since 
the auction may clear with bid values that are understated 
while bidding proxies that automatically adjust user bids in 
response to other bids are effective in single-good auctions 
it is unclear how such proxies could be generally effective in 
a combinatorial auction without actually implementing the 
same clearing algorithm used by mirage which could be 
computationally expensive in summary s and s both 
point toward the need for a strategyproof auction mechanism 
in mirage in such an auction a user s optimal strategy is 
always to bid truthfully the first time thus rational users 
will never underbid and iterative bidding is unnecessary 
s rolling window manipulation unlike auctions for 
tangible goods resource allocation in computer systems 
fundamentally involves time since sharing of resources implies 
that a resource cannot be assigned to a given user process 
forever in mirage we addressed the issue of time by 
selling resources over a rolling window hours into the future 
with users able to bid for blocks or hours in 
length what we did not anticipate however was what 
would happen when the entire window of resources becomes 
fully allocated in this scenario which was the norm near 
the recent sensys deadline the entire -node × 
 hour window is allocated a user bidding for say hours 
thus needs to minimally wait hours for new -node 
× -hour columns of resources to become available 
the problem here is that a user can game the system 
by observing other bids and simply requesting fewer hours 
since columns will roll into the resource window before 
 columns a user bidding for hours outbids a -hour 
bid independent of each bid s value because resources for the 
 -hour bid are not available when the auction clears of 
course if other users also begin bidding for hours this 
opportunity disappears but then moves to durations shorter 
than hours in the limit all users bid for -hour blocks 
thereby eliminating the possibility of obtaining longer 
resource allocations which may be critical to the underlying 
sensornet experiment in practice we observed this type of 
gaming push winning bid durations down to hours 
with rampant gaming of the system occurring through 
s we responded by implementing and deploying auction 
a as mentioned a key difference of a compared to a is 
that it allocates resources over a -hour window with bid 
start times constrained to be within the next hours in 
expanding the window and expanding while still 
constraining the range of start times a eliminates strategy s 
when the entire -node × -hour window is allocated 
a pending -hour bid and a pending -hour bid will both 
time project value nodes hours 
 - - u 
 - - u 
 - - u 
 - - u 
table strategy s on mica motes 
have their first opportunity for an allocation when new 
columns become available at that point both the -hour 
bid and the -hour bid will have an opportunity to obtain 
an allocation such allocations are then determined by the 
usual greedy clearing algorithm 
s auction sandwich attack while a eliminated s and 
significantly reduced s and s it still retained a weakness 
of a that had yet to be discovered and exploited in the 
auction sandwich attack a user exploits two pieces of 
information i historical information on previous winning bids 
to estimate the current workload and ii the greedy nature 
of the auction clearing algorithm in this particular case 
a user employs a strategy of splitting a bid for mica 
motes across several bids only one of which has a high value 
per node hour since the high value bid is likely to win due 
to the greedy nature of the auction clearing algorithm and 
since all other users at the time were all requesting motes 
 based on the historical information and the fact that the 
sensys deadline was imminent requiring experiments at 
scale no other bids could backfill the remaining slots the 
user s remaining bids would then fit those slots at a low 
price an actual occurrence is shown in table here user 
u uses three bids the main one being a bid with value 
 value per node hour · which is 
used to outbid a bid with value value per node hour 
 · once the high valued -node bid 
has occupied its portion of the resource window no other 
 -node bids can be matched consequently the user 
backfills on the remaining nodes using two bids a -node 
bid and a -node bid both at low valuations 
 challenges and refinements 
designing an appropriate auction mechanism is key to 
addressing the above strategies specifically our goals for such 
a mechanism include i strategyproofness ii 
computational tractability and iii optimal allocation the 
generalized vickrey auction gva is the only known 
combinatorial mechanism that provides both strategyproofness 
and optimal allocation however it also is 
computationally intractable as it is np-hard to calculate the allocations 
as well as individual payments other vcg-based 
mechanisms exist that replace the allocation algorithms in gva 
with approximate ones to provide tractability in this case 
however strategyproofness is no longer available these 
goals are in conflict for vcg and in general we thus 
must make certain trade-offs 
with this in mind we now present a two-phase roadmap 
for improving mirage i short-term improvements to the 
current mechanism that mitigate the effects of existing 
strategies and ii designing a new mechanism that approximately 
achieves our three goals simultaneously 
 ongoing improvements 
our first improvement is a mixed-integer programming 
 
 mip formulation as an alternative to the greedy algorithm 
this is aimed directly at eliminating strategy s while 
the mip does not provide strategyproofness it is able to 
compute approximately-optimal allocations like the gva 
however the mip is computationally demanding and thus 
careful formulation of the mip and optimizations based on 
the observed workloads from mirage will be required to 
ensure timely clearing of the auction our first step is to test 
and optimize our mip-based algorithm on auction data from 
the past four months we can then run both the mip 
alongside the greedy algorithm in parallel and select the higher 
quality result each time the auction clears 
second we can also augment the auction with additional 
rules and fees to further mitigate strategic behavior to 
eliminate s two possibilities are to restrict each user to 
having either one outstanding bid at a time or to mandate 
that users are not allowed to have multiple overlapping 
allocations in time to mitigate s and s we could add 
transaction fees with such fees in place a user who 
understates a bid and intends to iteratively refine it will have a 
disincentive to do so given that each iteration incurs a fee 
finally another approach to eliminating s is to modify 
the greedy algorithm such that if users do have bids whose 
allocations could overlap in time then those potential 
allocations are considered from lowest to highest value per node 
hour in effect this allows bids for overlapping allocations 
but creates a disincentive for users to place such bids 
 towards a strategyproof mechanism 
clearly we need to evaluate our goals and identify where 
we can make trade-offs in designing a new mechanism 
computational tractability is a fundamental requirement for 
operational reasons strategyproofness or minimally making 
the system hard to manipulate is also key given the behavior 
we have observed finally our mechanism should compute 
near-optimal allocations given our compute time budget 
among the potential mechanisms we can extend the los 
scheme seems to be a good starting point it is a fast 
algorithm as the allocation rule is a greedy mechanism 
ranking bids with some norm such as value per node hour 
the advantage of los is its special payment scheme that is 
tightly linked to the greedy allocation essentially a winner 
i pays the norm of the first bidder denied access times the 
amount of units i e node hours that i won this feature 
makes it strategyproof the main downside however is that 
it assumes users are single-minded meaning that each 
bidder only cares about a specific set of goods e g a specific 
list of nodes for specific durations and they do not value 
anything else unfortunately this is highly restrictive and 
contradicts what mirage currently offers its users namely 
the ability to select any subset of nodes for any slots and 
submit multiple bids thus los is vulnerable to s and to 
avoid it we must find a way to extend los and its 
strategyproof property to satisfy complex-bidders 
realistically even with a strategyproof los scheme for 
complex bidders there will likely be further strategies we 
have yet to encounter and that we should consider in our 
design for instance our discussion so far focuses on 
strategyproofness within a single auction across auctions 
however there may be temporal strategies that are possible for 
example in a particular auction suppose the highest bidder 
wants all nodes and pays using gva payment scheme for 
simplicity the next bidder s value this same bidder may 
be better off by waiting until the next auction if the user 
can still win and face bidders that have even lower values 
in this case the user will gain additional utility due to a 
lower payment this however may create various problems 
as total revenue total value as well as allocative efficiency 
across the auctions may be adversely affected 
there are two techniques we can use to address 
temporal strategies the first is a wrapper scheme such as the 
one employed by virtual worlds vw that makes 
sequences of individually strategyproof auctions e g los 
strategyproof what vw does is after bidder i wins it 
tracks what would have happened if i had submitted in a 
subsequent auction instead specifically it tracks what i 
would have paid in all following auctions during i s patience 
 i e the maximum time i is willing to wait for an 
allocation and keeps track of the lowest possible payment i will 
instead be charged the lowest payment and will thus have 
no incentive to temporally game the system alternatively 
the new class of online mechanisms assumes dynamic 
arrival and departure of bidders and does not hold auctions 
at fixed intervals instead the mechanism is a continuous 
scheme that accepts bids as they arrive and makes allocation 
decisions immediately thus removing any need to clear 
auctions the challenge is that the current literature is still 
restricted to non-combinatorial settings 
 conclusion 
despite initially using a repeated combinatorial auction 
known not to be strategyproof mirage has shown significant 
promise as a vehicle for sensornet testbed allocation the 
dual observations of significant resource contention and a 
wide range of valuations suggest that auction-based schemes 
can deliver large improvements in aggregate utility when 
compared to traditional approaches such as proportional 
share allocation or batch scheduling fully realizing these 
gains however requires addressing key problems in 
strategyproof mechanism design and combinatorial optimization 
the temporal nature of computational resources and the 
combinatorial resource demands of distributed applications 
adds an additional layer of complexity nevertheless we 
remain optimistic and believe that a pragmatic mix of theory 
and practice combined with iterative improvements on real 
deployments provides one promising avenue toward bringing 
market-based resource allocation into the mainstream
