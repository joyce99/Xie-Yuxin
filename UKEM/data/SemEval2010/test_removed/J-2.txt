abstract 
for allocation problems with one or more items the 
wellknown vickrey-clarke-groves vcg mechanism is efficient 
strategy-proof individually rational and does not incur a 
deficit however the vcg mechanism is not strongly 
budget balanced generally the agents payments will sum 
to more than if there is an auctioneer who is selling 
the items this may be desirable because the surplus 
payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer however if 
the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely 
interested in allocating the items efficiently among 
themselves any surplus payment is undesirable because it will 
have to flow out of the system of agents in 
cavallo proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of 
the vcg payment back to the agents while maintaining 
efficiency strategy-proofness individual rationality and the 
non-deficit property in this paper we extend this result in a 
restricted setting we study allocation settings where there 
are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good and 
agents have unit demand for this specific setting 
cavallo s mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by 
bailey in here we propose a family of mechanisms 
that redistribute some of the vcg payment back to the 
agents all mechanisms in the family are efficient 
strategyproof individually rational and never incur a deficit the 
family includes the bailey-cavallo mechanism as a special 
case we then provide an optimization model for finding the 
optimal mechanism-that is the mechanism that maximizes 
redistribution in the worst case-inside the family and show 
how to cast this model as a linear program we give both 
numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program 
and the unique resulting mechanism shows significant 
improvement over the bailey-cavallo mechanism in the worst 
case finally we prove that the obtained mechanism is 
optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that

 introduction 
many important problems in computer science and 
electronic commerce can be modeled as resource allocation 
problems in such problems we want to allocate the resources 
 or items to the agents that value them the most 
unfortunately agents valuations are private knowledge and 
self-interested agents will lie about their valuations if this 
is to their benefit one solution is to auction off the items 
possibly in a combinatorial auction where agents can bid 
on bundles of items there exist ways of determining the 
payments that the agents make in such an auction that 
incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that 
is the payments make the auction strategy-proof one very 
general way of doing so is to use the vcg mechanism 
 the vcg mechanism is also known as the clarke 
mechanism or in the specific context of auctions the 
generalized vickrey auction 
besides strategy-proofness the vcg mechanism has 
several other nice properties in the context of resource 
allocation problems it is efficient the chosen allocation always 
maximizes the sum of the agents valuations it is also 
 expost individually rational participating in the mechanism 
never makes an agent worse off than not participating 
finally it has a no-deficit property the sum of the agents 
payments is always nonnegative 
in many settings another property that would be 
desirable is strong budget balance meaning that the payments 
sum to exactly suppose the agents are trying to 
distribute some resources among themselves that do not have 
a previous owner for example the agents may be trying 
to allocate the right to use a shared good on a given day 
or the agents may be trying to allocate a resource that 
they have collectively constructed discovered or otherwise 
obtained if the agents use an auction to allocate these 
resources and the sum of the agents payments in the auction 
is positive then this surplus payment must leave the system 
 
of the agents for example the agents must give the money 
to an outside party or burn it na¨ıve redistribution of the 
surplus payment e g each of the n agents receives n of 
the surplus will generally result in a mechanism that is not 
strategy-proof e g in a vickrey auction the second-highest 
bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger 
redistribution payment unfortunately the vcg mechanism 
is not budget balanced typically there is surplus payment 
unfortunately in general settings it is in fact impossible to 
design mechanisms that satisfy budget balance in addition 
to the other desirable properties 
in light of this impossibility result several authors have 
obtained budget balance by sacrificing some of the other 
desirable properties another approach that 
is perhaps preferable is to use a mechanism that is more 
budget balanced than the vcg mechanism and maintains 
all the other desirable properties one way of trying to 
design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the vcg 
payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the 
agents incentives so that strategy-proofness is maintained 
and that will maintain the other properties in 
cavallo pursued exactly this idea and designed a mechanism 
that redistributes a large amount of the total vcg payment 
while maintaining all of the other desirable properties of 
the vcg mechanism for example in a single-item auction 
 where the vcg mechanism coincides with the second-price 
sealed-bid auction the amount redistributed to bidder i 
by cavallo s mechanism is n times the second-highest bid 
among bids other than i s bid the total redistributed is at 
most the second-highest bid overall and the redistribution 
to agent i does not affect i s incentives because it does not 
depend on i s own bid 
in this paper we restrict our attention to a limited 
setting and in this setting we extend cavallo s result we 
study allocation settings where there are multiple 
indistinguishable units of a single good and all agents have unit 
demand i e they want only a single unit for this specific 
setting cavallo s mechanism coincides with a mechanism 
proposed by bailey in here we propose the family 
of linear vcg redistribution mechanisms all mechanisms 
in this family are efficient strategy-proof individually 
rational and never incur a deficit the family includes the 
bailey-cavallo mechanism as a special case with the caveat 
that we only study allocation settings with multiple 
indistinguishable units of a single good and unit demand while 
bailey s and cavallo s mechanisms can be applied outside 
these settings as well we then provide an optimization 
model for finding the optimal mechanism inside the family 
based on worst-case analysis both numerical and 
analytical solutions of this model are provided and the resulting 
mechanism shows significant improvement over the 
baileycavallo mechanism in the worst case for example for 
the problem of allocating a single unit when the number 
of agents is our mechanism always redistributes more 
than of the total vcg payment back to the agents 
 whereas the bailey-cavallo mechanism redistributes only 
 in the worst case finally we prove that our 
mechanism is in fact optimal among all anonymous deterministic 
mechanisms even nonlinear ones that satisfy the desirable 
properties 
around the same time the same mechanism has been 
independently derived by moulin 
moulin actually 
pursues a different objective also based on worst-case analysis 
whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of vcg 
payments that are redistributed moulin tries to minimize 
the overall payments from agents as a percentage of 
efficiency it turns out that the resulting mechanisms are the 
same towards the end of this paper we consider dropping 
the individual rationality requirement and show that this 
does not change the optimal mechanism for our objective 
for moulin s objective dropping individual rationality does 
change the optimal mechanism but only if there are 
multiple units 
 problem description 
let n denote the number of agents and let m denote the 
number of units we only consider the case where m n 
 otherwise the problem becomes trivial we also assume 
that m and n are always known this assumption is not 
harmful in environments where anyone can join the auction 
running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good 
idea anyway because everyone would want to join to collect 
part of the redistribution 
let the set of agents be a a an where ai is the 
agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is we have ˆv ≥ 
ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn ≥ let vi denote the true value of ai 
given that the mechanism is strategy-proof we can assume 
vi ˆvi 
under the vcg mechanism each agent among a am 
wins a unit and pays ˆvm for this unit thus the total 
vcg payment equals mˆvm when m this is the 
second-price or vickrey auction 
we modify the mechanism as follows after running the 
original vcg mechanism the center returns to each agent 
ai some amount zi agent ai s redistribution payment we 
do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi because of this ai s 
incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment and the 
mechanism remains strategy-proof 
 linear vcg redistribution 
mechanisms 
we are now ready to introduce the family of linear vcg 
redistribution mechanisms such a mechanism is defined by 
a vector of constants c c cn− the amount that the 
mechanism returns to agent ai is zi c c ˆv c ˆv 
 ci− ˆvi− ciˆvi cn− ˆvn that is an agent 
receives c plus c times the highest bid other than the 
agent s own bid plus c times the second-highest other bid 
etc the mechanism is strategy-proof because for all i zi 
is independent of ˆvi also the mechanism is anonymous 
it is helpful to see the entire list of redistribution 
payments 
z c c ˆv c ˆv c ˆv cn− ˆvn− cn− ˆvn

working paper 
 
not all choices of the constants c cn− produce a 
mechanism that is individually rational and not all choices 
of the constants produce a mechanism that never incurs a 
deficit hence to obtain these properties we need to place 
some constraints on the constants 
to satisfy the individual rationality criterion each agent s 
utility should always be non-negative an agent that does 
not win a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agent s 
redistribution payment an agent that wins a unit obtains a 
utility that is equal to the agent s valuation for the unit 
minus the vcg payment ˆvm plus the agent s redistribution 
payment 
consider agent an the agent with the lowest bid since 
this agent does not win an item m n her utility is just 
her redistribution payment zn hence for the mechanism 
to be individually rational the ci must be such that zn is 
always nonnegative if the ci have this property then it 
actually follows that zi is nonnegative for every i for the 
following reason suppose there exists some i n and some 
vector of bids ˆv ≥ ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn ≥ such that zi 
then consider the bid vector that results from replacing ˆvj 
by ˆvj for all j ≥ i and letting ˆvn if we omit ˆvn 
from this vector the same vector results that results from 
omitting ˆvi from the original vector therefore an s 
redistribution payment under the new vector should be the same as 
ai s redistribution payment under the old vector-but this 
payment is negative 
if all redistribution payments are always nonnegative then 
the mechanism must be individually rational because the 
vcg mechanism is individually rational and the 
redistribution payment only increases an agent s utility therefore 
the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any 
bid vector zn ≥ 
to satisfy the non-deficit criterion the sum of the 
redistribution payments should be less than or equal to the total 
vcg payment so for any bid vector ˆv ≥ ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn ≥ 
 the constants ci should make z z zn ≤ mˆvm 
we define the family of linear vcg redistribution 
mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms 
corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints 
 so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and 
have the no-deficit property we now give two examples of 
mechanisms in this family 
example bailey-cavallo mechanism consider the 
mechanism corresponding to cm m 
n 
and ci for all 
other i under this mechanism each agent receives a 
redistribution payment of m 
n 
times the m th highest bid from 
another agent hence a am receive a redistribution 
payment of m 
n 
ˆvm and the others receive m 
n 
ˆvm thus 
the total redistribution payment is m m 
n 
ˆvm n−m− 
 m 
n 
ˆvm this redistribution mechanism is individually 
rational because all the redistribution payments are 
nonnegative and never incurs a deficit because m m 
n 
ˆvm 
 n−m− m 
n 
ˆvm ≤ nm 
n 
ˆvm mˆvm we note that for 
this mechanism to make sense we need n ≥ m 
example consider the mechanism corresponding to 
cm m 
n−m− 
 cm − m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
 and ci 
for all other i in this mechanism each agent receives a 
redistribution payment of m 
n−m− 
times the m th 
highest reported value from other agents minus m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
times the m th highest reported value from other agents 
thus the total redistribution payment is mˆvm − 
m m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
ˆvm if n ≥ m which is equivalent to 
m 
n−m− 
≥ m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
 then each agent always receives 
a nonnegative redistribution payment thus the mechanism 
is individually rational also the mechanism never incurs 
a deficit because the total vcg payment is mˆvm which 
is greater than the amount mˆvm − m m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
ˆvm 
that is redistributed 
which of these two mechanisms is better is there another 
mechanism that is even better this is what we study in 
the next section 
 optimal redistribution 
mechanisms 
among all linear vcg redistribution mechanisms we would 
like to be able to identify the one that redistributes the 
greatest percentage of the total vcg payment 
this is not 
a well-defined notion it may be that one mechanism 
redistributes more on some bid vectors and another more on 
other bid vectors we emphasize that we do not assume that 
a prior distribution over bidders valuations is available so 
we cannot compare them based on expected redistribution 
below we study three well-defined ways of comparing 
redistribution mechanisms best-case performance dominance 
and worst-case performance 
best-case performance one way of evaluating a 
mechanism is by considering the highest redistribution 
percentage that it achieves consider the previous two examples 
for the first example the total redistribution payment is 
 m m 
n 
ˆvm n − m − m 
n 
ˆvm when ˆvm ˆvm 
this is equal to the total vcg payment mˆvm thus this 
mechanism redistributes of the total vcg payment in 
the best case for the second example the total 
redistribution payment is mˆvm − m m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
ˆvm when 
ˆvm this is equal to the total vcg payment mˆvm 
thus this mechanism also redistributes of the total 
vcg payment in the best case 
moreover there are actually infinitely many mechanisms 
that redistribute of the total vcg payment in the best 
case-for example any convex combination of the above two 
will redistribute if both ˆvm ˆvm and ˆvm 
dominance inside the family of linear vcg 
redistribution mechanisms we say one mechanism dominates another 
mechanism if the first one redistributes at least as much as 
the other for any bid vector for the previous two examples 
neither dominates the other because they each redistribute 
 in different cases it turns out that there is no 
mechanism in the family that dominates all other mechanisms in 
the family for suppose such a mechanism exists then 
it should dominate both examples above consider the 
remaining vcg payment the vcg payment failed to be 
redistributed the remaining vcg payment of the dominant 
mechanism should be whenever ˆvm ˆvm or ˆvm 
now the remaining vcg payment is a linear function of the 
ˆvi linear redistribution and therefore also a polynomial 
function the above implies that this function can be 
written as ˆvm − ˆvm ˆvm p ˆv ˆv ˆvn where p is a 
 
the percentage redistributed seems the natural criterion to 
use among other things because it is scale-invariant if we 
multiply all bids by the same positive constant for example 
if we change the units by re-expressing the bids in euros 
instead of dollars we would not want the behavior of our 
mechanism to change 
 
polynomial function but since the function must be linear 
 has degree at most it follows that p thus a 
dominant mechanism would always redistribute all of the vcg 
payment which is not possible if it were possible then our 
worst-case optimal redistribution mechanism would also 
always redistribute all of the vcg payment and we will see 
later that it does not 
worst-case performance finally we can evaluate a 
mechanism by considering the lowest redistribution 
percentage that it guarantees for the first example the total 
redistribution payment is m m 
n 
ˆvm n−m− m 
n 
ˆvm 
which is greater than or equal to n−m− m 
n 
ˆvm so in the 
worst case which is when ˆvm the percentage 
redistributed is n−m− 
n 
 for the second example the total 
redistribution payment is mˆvm − m m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
ˆvm which 
is greater than or equal to mˆvm − m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
 so 
in the worst case which is when ˆvm ˆvm the 
percentage redistributed is − m m 
 n−m− n−m− 
 since we 
assume that the number of agents n and the number of units 
m are known we can determine which example mechanism 
has better worst-case performance by comparing the two 
quantities when n and m for the first example 
 bailey-cavallo mechanism the percentage redistributed in 
the worst case is 
 
 and for the second example this 
percentage is 
 
 which implies that for this pair of n and m 
the first mechanism has better worst-case performance on 
the other hand when n and m for the first 
example the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 
 
 and 
for the second example this percentage is 
 
 which implies 
that this time the second mechanism has better worst-case 
performance 
thus it seems most natural to compare mechanisms by 
the percentage of total vcg payment that they redistribute 
in the worst case this percentage is undefined when the 
total vcg payment is to deal with this technically we 
define the worst-case redistribution percentage as the largest 
k so that the total amount redistributed is at least k times 
the total vcg payment for all bid vectors hence as long 
as the total amount redistributed is at least when the total 
vcg payment is these cases do not affect the worst-case 
percentage this corresponds to the following optimization 
problem 
maximize k the percentage redistributed in the 
worst case 
subject to 
for every bid vector ˆv ≥ ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn ≥ 
zn ≥ individual rationality 
z z zn ≤ mˆvm non-deficit 
z z zn ≥ kmˆvm worst-case constraint 
we recall that zi c c ˆv c ˆv ci− ˆvi−

 transformation to linear 
programming 
the optimization problem given in the previous section 
can be rewritten as a linear program based on the following 
observations 
claim if c c cn− satisfy both the individual 
rationality and the non-deficit constraints then ci for 
i m 
proof first let us prove that c consider the 
bid vector in which ˆvi for all i to obtain individual 
rationality we must have c ≥ to satisfy the non-deficit 
constraint we must have c ≤ thus we know c 
now if ci for all i there is nothing to prove otherwise 
let j min i ci assume that j ≤ m we recall that 
we can write the individual rationality constraint as follows 
zn c c ˆv c ˆv c ˆv cn− ˆvn− cn− ˆvn− ≥ 
for any bid vector let us consider the bid vector in which 
ˆvi for i ≤ j and ˆvi for the rest in this case zn cj 
so we must have cj ≥ the non-deficit constraint can 
be written as follows z z zn ≤ mˆvm for any 
bid vector consider the same bid vector as above we have 
zi for i ≤ j because for these bids the jth highest other 
bid has value so all the ci that are nonzero are multiplied 
by for i j we have zi cj because the jth highest 
other bid has value and all lower bids have value so 
the non-deficit constraint tells us that cj n − j ≤ mˆvm 
because j ≤ m ˆvm so the right hand side is we 
also have n − j because j ≤ m n so cj ≤ because 
we have already established that cj ≥ it follows that 
cj but this is contrary to assumption so j m 
incidentally this claim also shows that if m n − 
then ci for all i thus we are stuck with the vcg 
mechanism from here on we only consider the case where 
m n − 
claim the individual rationality constraint can be 
written as follows 
pj 
i m ci ≥ for j m n − 
before proving this claim we introduce the following lemma 
lemma given a positive integer k and a set of real 
constants s s sk s t s t sktk ≥ for any 
t ≥ t ≥ ≥ tk ≥ if and only if 
pj 
i si ≥ for 
j k 
proof let di ti −ti for i k− and dk 
tk then s t s t sktk ≥ for any t ≥ t ≥ ≥ 
tk ≥ is equivalent to 
p 
i si d 
p 
i si d 
 
pk 
i si dk ≥ for any set of arbitrary non-negative dj 
when 
pj 
i si ≥ for j k the above inequality 
is obviously true if for some j 
pj 
i si if we set dj 
and di for all i j then the above inequality becomes 
false so 
pj 
i si ≥ for j k is both necessary 
and sufficient 
we are now ready to present the proof of claim 
proof the individual rationality constraint can be 
written as zn c c ˆv c ˆv c ˆv cn− ˆvn− 
cn− ˆvn− ≥ for any bid vector ˆv ≥ ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn− ≥ 
ˆvn ≥ we have already shown that ci for i ≤ m 
thus the above can be simplified to zn cm ˆvm 
cm ˆvm cn− ˆvn− cn− ˆvn− ≥ for any bid vector 
by the above lemma this is equivalent to 
pj 
i m ci ≥ 
for j m n − 
claim the non-deficit constraint and the worst-case 
constraint can also be written as linear inequalities involving 
only the ci and k 
proof the non-deficit constraint requires that for any 
bid vector z z zn ≤ mˆvm where zi c c ˆv 
 
c ˆv ci− ˆvi− ciˆvi cn− ˆvn for i n 
because ci for i ≤ m we can simplify this inequality to 
qm ˆvm qm ˆvm qnˆvn ≥ 
qm m − n − m − cm 
qi − i− ci− − n−i ci for i m n− when 
m n − this set of equalities is empty 
qn − n − cn− 
by the above lemma this is equivalent to 
pj 
i m qi ≥ 
for j m n so we can simplify further as follows 
qm ≥ ⇐⇒ n − m − cm ≤ m 
qm qm i ≥ ⇐⇒ n 
pj m i− 
j m cj n − m − 
i cm i ≤ m for i n − m − 
qm qn ≥ ⇐⇒ n 
pj n− 
j m cj ≤ m 
so the non-deficit constraint can be written as a set of 
linear inequalities involving only the ci 
the worst-case constraint can be also written as a set of 
linear inequalities by the following reasoning the 
worstcase constraint requires that for any bid input z z 
zn ≥ kmˆvm where zi c c ˆv c ˆv ci− ˆvi− 
ciˆvi cn− ˆvn for i n because ci for 
i ≤ m we can simplify this inequality to 
qm ˆvm qm ˆvm qnˆvn ≥ 
qm n − m − cm − km 
qi i − ci− n − i ci for i m n − 
qn n − cn− 
by the above lemma this is equivalent to 
pj 
i m qi ≥ 
for j m n so we can simplify further as follows 
qm ≥ ⇐⇒ n − m − cm ≥ km 
qm qm i ≥ ⇐⇒ n 
pj m i− 
j m cj n − m − 
i cm i ≥ km for i n − m − 
qm qn ≥ ⇐⇒ n 
pj n− 
j m cj ≥ km 
so the worst-case constraint can also be written as a set 
of linear inequalities involving only the ci and k 
combining all the claims we see that the original 
optimization problem can be transformed into the following 
linear program 
variables cm cm cn− k 
maximize k the percentage redistributed in the 
worst case 
subject to pj 
i m ci ≥ for j m n − 
km ≤ n − m − cm ≤ m 
km ≤ n 
pj m i− 
j m cj n − m − i cm i ≤ m for 
i n − m − 
km ≤ n 
pj n− 
j m cj ≤ m 
 numerical results 
for selected values of n and m we solved the linear 
program using glpk gnu linear programming kit in the 
table below we present the results for a single unit m 
we present −k the percentage of the total vcg payment 
that is not redistributed by the worst-case optimal 
mechanism in the worst case instead of k in the second column 
because writing k would require too many significant digits 
correspondingly the third column displays the percentage

the worst-case optimal mechanism significantly

perhaps more surprisingly the worst-case optimal mechanism

recall that the total redistribution payment of the

optimal values for the ci are c 
 
 c − 
 
 and c 
 
 
that is the redistribution payment received by each agent 
is

the total amount redistributed is

ˆv is redistributed hence the 
percentage of the total vcg payment that is not

finally we compare the worst-case optimal mechanism to 
the bailey-cavallo mechanism for m n m 
 these results are in figure 
we see that for any m when n m the worst-case 
optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as 
the bailey-cavallo mechanism actually in this case the 
worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the 
baileycavallo mechanism when n m the worst-case 
optimal mechanism outperforms the bailey-cavallo mechanism

a linear program has no solution if and only if either the 
objective is unbounded or the constraints are contradictory 
 there is no feasible solution it is easy to see that k is 
bounded above by redistributing more than 
violates the non-deficit constraint also a feasible solution 
always exists for example k and ci for all i so an 
optimal solution always exists observe that the linear 
program model depends only on the number of agents n and the 
number of units m hence the optimal solution is a function 
of n and m it turns out that this optimal solution can be 
analytically characterized as follows

thus for all of the constraints other than the

this implies that the absolute value of c

with k k

we proceed to show that it is in fact the unique optimal 
solution 
first we prove the following claim 
claim if ˆk ˆxi i m m n − satisfy the 
following inequalities 
ˆkm ≤ n − m − ˆxm ≤ m 
ˆkm ≤ m i ˆxm i− n − m − i ˆxm i ≤ m for 
i n − m − 
ˆkm ≤ nˆxn− ≤ m 
ˆk ≥ k 
then we must have that ˆxi ˆx 
i and ˆk k 
 
proof of claim consider the first inequality we know 
that n − m − x 
m k 
m so n − m − ˆxm ≥ ˆkm ≥ 
k 
m n − m − x 
m it follows that ˆxm ≥ x 
m 
 n − m − 
now consider the next inequality for i we know 
that m x 
m n − m − x 
m m it follows that 
 n−m− ˆxm ≤ m− m ˆxm ≤ m− m x 
m 
 n − m − x 
m so ˆxm ≤ x 
m i ≤ n − m − ⇒ 
n − m − 
now consider the next inequality for i we know 
that m x 
m n − m − x 
m m it follows that 
 n−m− ˆxm ≥ ˆkm− m ˆxm ≥ k 
m− m x 
m 
 n − m − x 
m so ˆxm ≥ x 
m i ≤ n − m − ⇒ 
n − m − 
proceeding like this all the way up to i n−m− we get 
that ˆxm i ≥ x 
m i if i is odd and ˆxm i ≤ x 
m i if i is even 
moreover if one inequality is strict then all subsequent 
inequalities are strict now if we can prove ˆxn− x 
n− 
it would follow that the x 
i are equal to the ˆxi which also 
implies that ˆk k 
 we consider two cases 
case n − m is even we have n − m even ⇒ n − m − 
odd ⇒ ˆxn− ≥ x 
n− we also have n−m even ⇒ nx 
n− 
m combining these two we get m nx 
n− ≤ nˆxn− ≤ 
m ⇒ ˆxn− x 
n− 
case n − m is odd in this case we have ˆxn− ≤ x 
n− 
and nx 
n− k 
m then we have k 
m ≤ ˆkm ≤ nˆxn− ≤ 
nx 
n− k 
m ⇒ ˆxn− x 
n− 
this completes the proof of the claim 
it follows that if ˆk ˆxi i m m n − is a 
feasible solution and ˆk ≥ k 
 then since all the inequalities 
in claim are satisfied we must have ˆxi x 
i and ˆk 
k 
 hence no other feasible solution is as good as the one 
described in the theorem 
knowing the analytical characterization of the worst-case 
optimal mechanism provides us with at least two major 
benefits first using these formulas is computationally more 
efficient than solving the linear program using a 
generalpurpose solver second we can derive the following 
corollary 
corollary if the number of units m is fixed then as 
the number of agents n increases the worst-case percentage 
redistributed linearly converges to with a rate of 
convergence 
 
 that is limn→∞ 
 −k 
n 
 −k 
n 
 
 
 that is in the 
limit the percentage that is not redistributed halves for 
every additional agent 
we note that this is consistent with the experimental data 
for the single-unit case where the worst-case remaining 
percentage roughly halves each time we add another agent 
the worst-case percentage that is redistributed under the 
bailey-cavallo mechanism also converges to as the 
number of agents goes to infinity but the convergence is much 
slower-it does not converge linearly that is letting kc 
n be

mechanism in the worst case for n agents limn→∞

 worst-case optimality outside 
the family 
in this section we prove that the worst-case optimal 
redistribution mechanism among linear vcg redistribution 
mechanisms is in fact optimal in the worst case among 
all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic 
anonymous strategy-proof efficient and satisfy the non-deficit 
constraint thus restricting our attention to linear vcg 
redistribution mechanisms did not come at a loss 
to prove this theorem we need the following lemma this 
lemma is not new it was informally stated by cavallo 
for completeness we present it here with a detailed proof 
lemma a vcg redistribution mechanism is 
deterministic anonymous and strategy-proof if and only if there exists 
a function f rn− 
→ r so that the redistribution payment 
zi received by ai satisfies 
zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn 
for all i and all bid vectors 
proof first let us prove the only if direction that is 
if a vcg redistribution mechanism is deterministic 
anonymous and strategy-proof then there exists a deterministic 
function f rn− 
→ r which makes 
zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn 
for all i and all bid vectors 
if a vcg redistribution mechanism is deterministic and 
anonymous then for any bid vector ˆv ≥ ˆv ≥ ≥ ˆvn the 
mechanism outputs a unique redistribution payment list 
z z zn let g rn 
→ rn 
be the function that 
maps ˆv ˆv ˆvn to z z zn for all bid vectors let 
h i x x xn be the ith element of g x x xn 
so that zi h i ˆv ˆv ˆvn for all bid vectors and all 
 ≤ i ≤ n because the mechanism is anonymous two 
agents should receive the same redistribution payment if 
their bids are the same so if ˆvi ˆvj h i ˆv ˆv ˆvn 
h j ˆv ˆv ˆvn hence if we let j min t ˆvt ˆvi 
then h i ˆv ˆv ˆvn h j ˆv ˆv ˆvn 
let us define k rn 
→ n × rn 
as follows k y x x 
 xn− j w w wn where w w wn are 
y x x xn− sorted in descending order and 
j min t wt y t wt y ∅ because y ∈ w w 
 wn also let us define f rn 
→ r by 
f ˆvi ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn 
 h ◦ k ˆvi ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn 
 h min t ˆvt ˆvi ˆv ˆv ˆvn 
 h i ˆv ˆv ˆvn zi 
that is f is the redistribution payment to an agent that 
bids ˆvi when the other bids are ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn 
since our mechanism is required to be strategy-proof and 
the space of valuations is unrestricted zi should be 
independent of ˆvi by lemma in cavallo hence we can simply 
ignore the first variable input to f let f x x xn− 
f x x xn− so we have for all bid vectors and 
i zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn this completes the 
proof for the only if direction 
for the if direction if the redistribution payment 
received by ai satisfies zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn for 
all bid vectors and i then this is clearly a deterministic and 
anonymous mechanism to prove strategy-proofness we 
observe that because an agent s redistribution payment is not 
affected by her own bid her incentives are the same as in 
the vcg mechanism which is strategy-proof 
now we are ready to introduce the next theorem 
theorem for any m and n with n ≥ m the 
worstcase optimal mechanism among the family of linear vcg 
redistribution mechanisms is worst-case optimal among all 
mechanisms that are deterministic anonymous strategy-proof 
efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint 
while we needed individual rationality earlier in the 
paper this theorem does not mention it that is we can not 
find a mechanism with better worst-case performance even if 
we sacrifice individual rationality the worst-case optimal 
linear vcg redistribution mechanism is of course 
individually rational 
proof suppose there is a redistribution mechanism when 
the number of units is m and the number of agents is n that 
satisfies all of the above properties and has a better 
worstcase performance than the worst-case optimal linear vcg 
redistribution mechanism that is its worst-case 
redistribution percentage ˆk is strictly greater than k 
 
by lemma for this mechanism there is a function f 
rn− 
→ r so that zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn for 
all i and all bid vectors we first prove that f has the 
following properties 
claim f if the number of 
 s is less than or equal to m 
proof of claim we assumed that for this mechanism 
the worst-case redistribution percentage satisfies ˆk k 
≥ 
 if the total vcg payment is x the total redistribution 
payment should be in ˆkx x non-deficit criterion 
consider the case where all agents bid so that the total vcg 
payment is also hence the total redistribution payment 
should be in ˆk · -that is it should be hence every 
agent s redistribution payment f must be 
now let ti f where the number 
of s equals i we proved t if tn− consider the 
bid vector where everyone bids the total vcg payment is 
m and the total redistribution payment is nf 
ntn− this corresponds to redistribution which is 
contrary to our assumption that ˆk k 
≥ now consider 
j min i ti which is well-defined because tn− 
if j m the property is satisfied if j ≤ m consider 
the bid vector where ˆvi for i ≤ j and ˆvi for all 
other i under this bid vector the first j agents each get 
redistribution payment tj− and the remaining n − j 
agents each get tj thus the total redistribution payment 
is n − j tj because the total vcg payment for this bid 
vector is we must have n − j tj so tj j ≤ 
m n but this is contrary to the definition of j hence 
f if the number of s is less than 
or equal to m 
claim f satisfies the following inequalities 
ˆkm ≤ n − m − tm ≤ m 
ˆkm ≤ m i tm i− n − m − i tm i ≤ m for 
i n − m − 
ˆkm ≤ ntn− ≤ m 
here ti is defined as in the proof of claim 
 
proof of claim for j m n consider the bid 
vectors where ˆvi for i ≤ j and ˆvi for all other i 
these bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint 
and worst-case constraint produce the above set of 
inequalities for example when j m we consider the bid 
vector ˆvi for i ≤ m and ˆvi for all other i 
the first m agents each receive a redistribution payment 
of tm and all other agents each receive tm thus 
the total vcg redistribution is n − m − tm the 
nondeficit constraint gives n − m − tm ≤ m because the 
total vcg payment is m the worst-case constraint gives 
 n − m − tm ≥ ˆkm combining these two we get the 
first inequality the other inequalities can be obtained in 
the same way 
we now observe that the inequalities in claim together 
with ˆk ≥ k 
 are the same as those in claim where the ti 
are replaced by the ˆxi thus we can conclude that ˆk k 
 
which is contrary to our assumption ˆk k 
 hence no 
mechanism satisfying all the listed properties has a redistribution 
percentage greater than k 
in the worst case 
so far we have only talked about the case where n ≥ m 
for the purpose of completeness we provide the following 
claim for the n m case 
claim for any m and n with n m the original 
vcg mechanism that is redistributing nothing is uniquely 
worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that 
are deterministic anonymous strategy-proof efficient and 
satisfy the non-deficit constraint 
we recall that when n m claim tells us that the only 
mechanism inside the family of linear redistribution 
mechanisms is the original vcg mechanism so that this 
mechanism is automatically worst-case optimal inside this family 
however to prove the above claim we need to show that it 
is worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms 
that have the desired properties 
proof suppose a redistribution mechanism exists that 
satisfies all of the above properties and has a worst-case 
performance as good as the original vcg mechanism that 
is its worst-case redistribution percentage is greater than 
or equal to this implies that the total redistribution 
payment of this mechanism is always nonnegative 
by lemma for this mechanism there is a function f 
rn− 
→ r so that zi f ˆv ˆv ˆvi− ˆvi ˆvn for 
all i and all bid vectors we will prove that f x x xn− 
 for all x ≥ x ≥ ≥ xn− ≥ 
first consider the bid vector where ˆvi for all i here 
each agent receives a redistribution payment f 
the total redistribution payment is then nf which 
should be both greater than or equal to by the above 
observation as well less than or equal to using the 
nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total vcg payment is 
 it follows that f now let us consider 
the bid vector where ˆv x ≥ and ˆvi for all other i 
for this bid vector the agent with the highest bid receives 
a redistribution payment of f and the other 
n − agents each receive f x by the same 
reasoning as above the total redistribution payment should be 
both greater than or equal to and less than or equal to 
hence f x for all x ≥ 
proceeding by induction let us assume f x x xk 
 for all x ≥ x ≥ ≥ xk ≥ for some 
k n − consider the bid vector where ˆvi xi for 
i ≤ k and ˆvi for all other i where the xi are 
arbitrary numbers satisfying x ≥ x ≥ ≥ xk ≥ xk ≥ 
for the agents with the highest k bids their 
redistribution payment is specified by f acting on an input with 
only k non-zero variables hence they all receive by 
induction assumption the other n − k − agents each 
receive f x x xk xk the total 
redistribution payment is then n−k− f x x xk xk 
which should be both greater than or equal to and less 
than or equal to the total vcg payment now in this bid 
vector the lowest bid is because k n but since 
n m the total vcg payment is mˆvn so 
we have f x x xk xk for all x ≥ 
x ≥ ≥ xk ≥ xk ≥ by induction this 
statement holds for all k n − when k n − we 
have f x x xn− xn− for all x ≥ x ≥ ≥ 
xn− ≥ xn− ≥ hence in this mechanism the 
redistribution payment is always that is the mechanism is just 
the original vcg mechanism 
incidentally we obtain the following corollary 
corollary no vcg redistribution mechanism 
satisfies all of the following determinism anonymity 
strategyproofness efficiency and strong budget balance this holds 
for any n ≥ m 
proof for the case n ≥ m if such a mechanism 
exists its worst-case performance would be better than that 
of the worst-case optimal linear vcg redistribution 
mechanism which by theorem obtains a redistribution 
percentage strictly less than but theorem shows that it is 
impossible to outperform this mechanism in the worst case 
for the case n m if such a mechanism exists 
it would perform as well as the original vcg mechanism 
in the worst case which implies that it is identical to the 
vcg mechanism by claim but the vcg mechanism is 
not strongly budget balanced 
 conclusions 
for allocation problems with one or more items the 
wellknown vickrey-clarke-groves vcg mechanism is efficient 
strategy-proof individually rational and does not incur a 
deficit however the vcg mechanism is not strongly 
budget balanced generally the agents payments will sum 
to more than if there is an auctioneer who is selling 
the items this may be desirable because the surplus 
payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer however if 
the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely 
interested in allocating the items efficiently among 
themselves any surplus payment is undesirable because it will 
have to flow out of the system of agents in 
cavallo proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of 
the vcg payment back to the agents while maintaining 
efficiency strategy-proofness individual rationality and the 
non-deficit property in this paper we extended this 
result in a restricted setting we studied allocation settings 
where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a 
single good and agents have unit demand for this specific 
setting cavallo s mechanism coincides with a mechanism 
proposed by bailey in here we proposed a family 
of mechanisms that redistribute some of the vcg payment 
 
back to the agents all mechanisms in the family are 
efficient strategy-proof individually rational and never incur 
a deficit the family includes the bailey-cavallo mechanism 
as a special case we then provided an optimization model 
for finding the optimal mechanism-that is the mechanism 
that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the 
family and showed how to cast this model as a linear 
program we gave both numerical and analytical solutions 
of this linear program and the unique resulting 
mechanism shows significant improvement over the bailey-cavallo 
mechanism in the worst case finally we proved that the 
obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous 
deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties 
one important direction for future research is to try to 
extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit 
demand however it turns out that in sufficiently general 
settings the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage 
is in such settings the worst-case criterion provides no 
guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism 
 even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case 
percentage so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria 
alternatively one can try to identify other special settings 
in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible 
another direction for future research is to consider whether 
this mechanism has applications to collusion for example 
in a typical collusive scheme there is a bidding ring 
consisting of a number of colluders who submit only a single 
bid if this bid wins the colluders must allocate the 
item amongst themselves perhaps using payments-but of 
course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring 
this work is part of a growing literature on designing 
mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case 
traditionally economists have mostly focused either on 
designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties such 
as the vcg mechanism or on designing mechanisms that 
are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the 
agents preferences such as the myerson auction and the 
maskin-riley auction for maximizing expected revenue 
some more recent papers have focused on designing 
mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive 
analysis e g there has also been growing 
interest in the design of online mechanisms where the 
agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before 
all the agents have arrived such work often also takes a 
worst-case competitive analysis approach it does 
not appear that there are direct connections between our 
work and these other works that focus on designing 
mechanisms that perform well in the worst case nevertheless 
it seems likely that future research will continue to 
investigate mechanism design for the worst case and hopefully a 
coherent framework will emerge
