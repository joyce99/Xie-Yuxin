abstract 
this paper presents a two-sided economic search model in which 
agents are searching for beneficial pairwise partnerships in each 
search stage each of the agents is randomly matched with several 
other agents in parallel and makes a decision whether to accept a 
potential partnership with one of them the distinguishing feature 
of the proposed model is that the agents are not restricted to 
maintaining a synchronized instantaneous decision protocol and can 
sequentially accept and reject partnerships within the same search 
stage we analyze the dynamics which drive the agents strategies 
towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the 
proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use 
for the two-sided parallel economic search model by identifying 
several unique characteristics of the equilibrium we manage to 
efficiently bound the strategy space that needs to be explored by the 
agents and propose an efficient means for extracting the distributed 
equilibrium strategies in common environments

 introduction 
a two-sided economic search is a distributed mechanism for 
forming agents pairwise partnerships 
on every stage of the 
process each of the agents is randomly matched with another agent 
 
notice that the concept of search here is very different from the classical 
definition of search in ai while ai search is an active process in which 
an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state 
to a goal state economic search refers to the identification of the best agent 
to commit to a partnership with 
and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit 
encapsulated in a partnership between them the interaction does 
not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose 
between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent 
a typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place 
is the marriage market recent literature suggests various 
software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed 
 i e with no centralized matching mechanisms search takes place 
an important class of such applications includes secondary 
markets for exchanging unexploited resources an exchange 
mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the 
core business of the organization or when the overhead for 
selling them makes it non-beneficial for example through a 
twosided search agents representing different service providers can 
exchange unused bandwidth and communication satellites can 
transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage 
twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of 
buyers and sellers in emarkets and peer-to-peer applications the 
twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair 
of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted by forming a 
partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their 
search when resuming the search on the other hand a more 
suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to 
be consumed for maintaining the search process 
in this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search 
matching problems in which the performance of the partnership 
applies to both parties i e both gain an equal utility the 
equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the 
partners gain from the synergy between them for example 
consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles or 
a canoe s paddler looking for a partner to practice with here 
the players are being rewarded completely based on the team s 
 rather than the individual performance other examples are the 
scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on 
an assignment for which both partners share the same grade and 
the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or 
interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together taking 
advantage of discount for quantity i e each of them enjoys the 
same reduced price in all these applications any two agents can 
form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership 
depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members 
furthermore the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is 
an option for side-payments and the partnership s overall utility is 
equally split among the two agents forming it 
while the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive 
equilibrium analysis for various models it assumes that the agents 
search is conducted in a purely sequential manner each agent 
locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
 nevertheless when the search is assigned to autonomous 
software agents a better search strategy can be used here an agent 
can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information 
processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently in 
comparison to people maintain concurrent interactions with several other 
agents at each stage of its search such use of parallel interactions 
in search is favorable whenever the average cost 
per interaction 
with another agent when interacting in parallel with a batch of 
other agents is smaller than the cost of maintaining one 
interaction at a time i e advantage to size for example the analysis of 
the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between 
service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when 
using the parallel search thus the average cost per interaction 
decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases 
despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in 
adjacent domains e g in one-sided economic search a first 
attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which 
agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other 
agents at a time was introduced only recently however the 
agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their 
decision making process thus each agent upon reviewing the 
opportunities available in a specific search stage has to notify all 
other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership at 
most with one of them or reject the partnership with the rest of 
them this inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on 
the agents strategic behavior 
in our model the agents are free to notify the other agents of 
their decisions in an asynchronous manner the asynchronous 
approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy based on each 
new response they receive from the agents they interact with this 
leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent 
upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents delays 
its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other 
potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent i e 
the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage 
except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is 
sequential rather than instantaneous the new model is a much more 
realistic pairwise model and as we show in the analysis section is 
always preferred by any single agents participating in the process 
in the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search 
models we use the model that relies on an instantaneous synchronous 
decision making process denoted i-dm throughout the rest 
of the paper as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our 
proposed sequential asynchronous decision making strategy 
 denoted s-dm 
the main contributions of this paper are threefold first we 
formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the 
agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning 
the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they 
encounter in parallel the s-dm model this model is a general 
search model which can be applied in various not necessarily 
software agents-based domains second we prove that the agents 
sdm strategy weakly dominates the i-dm strategy thus every agent 
has an incentive to deviate to the s-dm strategy when all other 
agents are using the i-dm strategy finally by using an 
innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of 
different potential partnerships we identify unique characteristics of the 
equilibrium strategies in the new model these are used for 
supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the 
calculation of the agents equilibrium strategy this latter contribution is 
 
the term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for 
maintaining its search such as self advertisement locating other agents 
communicating with them and processing their offers 
of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode 
adds inherent complexity to the model mainly because now each 
agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent 
being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts 
with in a multi-stage sequential process we manage to extract the 
agents new equilibrium strategies without increasing the 
computational complexity in comparison to the i-dm model throughout 
the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model 
and compare it with the i-dm model using an artificial synthetic 
environment 
in the following section we formally present the s-dm model 
an equilibrium analysis and computational means for finding the 
equilibrium strategy are provided in section in section we 
review related mas and economic search theory literature we 
conclude with a discussion and suggest directions for future research 
in section 
 model and analysis 
we consider an environment populated with an infinite 
number of self-interested fully rational agents of different types 
 any 
agent ai can form a partnership with any other agent aj in the 
environment associated with an immediate perceived utility u ai aj 
for both agents as in many other partnership formation models 
 see we assume that the value of u x y where x and y 
are any two agents in the environment is randomly drawn from 
a continuous population characterized with a probability 
distribution function p d f f u and a cumulative distribution function 
 c d f f u ≤ u ∞ the agents are assumed to be 
acquainted with the utility distribution function f x however they 
cannot tell a-priori what utility can be gained by a partnership with 
any specific agent in their environment therefore the only way by 
which an agent ai can learn the value of a partnership with another 
agent aj u ai aj is by interacting with agent aj since each 
agent in two-sided search models has no prior information 
concerning any of the other agents in its environment it initiates 
interactions i e search with other agents randomly the nature of the 
two-sided search application suggests that the agents are satisfied 
with having a single partner thus once a partnership is formed the 
two agents forming it terminate their search process and leave the 
environment 
the agents are not limited to interacting with a single potential 
partner agent at a time but rather can select to interact with several 
other agents in parallel we define a search round stage as the 
interval in which the agent interacts with several agents in parallel and 
learns the utility of forming a partnership with each of them based 
on the learned values the agent needs to decide whether to commit 
or reject each of the potential partnerships available to it 
commitment is achieved by sending a commit message to the 
appropriate agent and an agent cannot commit to more than one potential 
partnership simultaneously declining a partnership is achieved by 
sending a reject message the communication between the agents 
is assumed to be asynchronous and each agent can delay its 
decision concerning any given potential partnership as necessary 
if 
two agents ai and aj mutually commit to a partnership between 
 
the infinite number of agents assumption is common in two-sided search 
models see in many domains e g ecommerce this derives 
from the high entrance and leave rates thus the probability of running into 
the same agent in a random match is negligible 
 
notice that the asynchronous procedure does not eliminate the inherent 
structure of the search the search is still based on stages rounds where on 
each search round the agent interacts with several other agents except that 
now the agent can delay its decision making process within each search 
round as necessary

them then the partnership is formed and both agents gain the 
immediate utility u ai aj associated with it if an agent does not 
form a partnership in a given search stage it continues to its next 
search stage and interacts with more agents in a similar manner 
given the option for asynchronous decision making each 
individual agent ai follows the following procedure 
 loop 
 set n number of parallel interactions for next search round 
 locate randomly a set a a an of agents to 
interact with 
 evaluate the set of utilities u ai a u ai an 
 set a 
 aj aj ∈a and u ai aj u resume 
 send a reject message to each agent in the set a \ a 
 
 while a 
 ∅ do 
 send a commit message to aj argmaxal∈a u ai al 
 remove aj from a 
 wait for aj s decision 
 if aj responded commit then 
 send reject messages to the remaining agents in a 
 terminate search 
 end if 
 end while 
 end loop 
where u resume denotes the expected utility of continuing the 
search in the following paragraphs we show that u resume is 
fixed throughout the search and derives from the agent s strategy 
in the above algorithm any agent ai first identifies the set a 
of 
other agents it is willing to accept out of those reviewed in the 
current search stage and sends a reject message to the rest then it 
sends a commit message to the agent aj ∈ a 
that is associated 
with the partnership yielding the highest utility if a reject message 
was received from agent aj then this agent is removed from a 
and a new commit message is sent according to the same criteria 
the process continues until either a the set a 
becomes empty 
in which case the agent initiates another search stage or b a dual 
commitment is obtained in which case the agent sends reject 
messages to the remaining agents in a 
 the method differs from the 
one used in the i-dm model in the way it handles the commitment 
messages in the i-dm model after evaluating the set of utilities 
 step the agent merely sends instantaneously a commit message 
to the agent associated with the greatest utility and a reject message 
to all the other agents it interacted with as a replacement to steps 
 - in the above procedure our proposed s-dm model is much 
more intuitive as it allows an agent to hold and possibly exploit 
relatively beneficial opportunities even if its first priority 
partnership is rejected by the other agent in the i-dm model on the other 
hand since reject messages are sent alongside the commit message 
simultaneously a reject message from the agent associated with the 
best partnership enforces a new search round 
notice that the two-sided search mechanism above aligns with 
most other two-sided search mechanisms in a sense that it is based 
on random matching i e in each search round the agent 
encounters a random sample of agents while the maintenance of the 
random matching infrastructure is an interesting research question it 
is beyond the scope of this paper notwithstanding we do wish 
to emphasize that given the large number of agents in the 
environment and the fact that in mas the turnover rate is quite substantial 
due to the open nature of the environment and the 
interoperability between environments therefore the probability of ending up 
interacting with the same agent more than once when initiating a 
random interaction is practically negligible 
theorem the s-dm agent s decision making process a 
is the optimal one maximizes the utility for any individual agent 
in the environment and b guarantees a zero deadlock probability 
for any given agent in the environment 
proof 
 a the method is optimal since it cannot be changed in a way that 
produces a better utility for the agent since bargaining is not 
applicable here benefits are non-divisible then the agent s strategy is 
limited to accepting or rejecting offers the decision of rejecting a 
partnership in step is based only on the immediate utility that can 
be gained from this partnership in comparison to the expected 
utility of resuming the search i e moving on to the next search stage 
and is not affected by the willingness of the other agents to commit 
or reject a partnership with ai as for partnerships that yield a 
utility greater than the expected utility of resuming the search i e the 
partnerships with agents from the set a 
 the agent always prefers 
to delay its decision concerning partnerships of this type until 
receiving all notifications concerning potential partnerships that are 
associated with a greater immediate utility the delay never results 
with a loss of opportunity since the other agent s decision 
concerning this opportunity is not affected by agent ai s willingness to 
commit or reject this opportunity but rather by the other agent s 
estimation of its expected utility if resuming the search and the 
rejection messages it receives for more beneficial potential 
partnerships finally the agent cannot benefit from delaying a commit 
message to the agent associated with the highest utility in a 
 thus 
will always send it a commit message 
 b we first prove the following lemma that states that the 
probability of having two partnering opportunities associated with an 
identical utility is zero 
lemma when f is a continuous distribution function then 
lim 
y→x 
 z y 
z x 
f z dz 
- 
 
 
proof since f is continuous and the interval between x and y is 
finite by the intermediate value theorem found in most calculus 
texts there exists a c between x and y thatz y

f z dz f c y − x 
 intuitively a rectangle with the base from z x to z y and 
height f c has the same area as the integral on the left hand 
side therefore

when y → x f c stays bounded due to continuity of f moreover

lim

- 
 
 f x 
lim 
y→x 
 y − x 
 
an immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no 
tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is 
always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated 
with the highest utility among the agents in the set a 
 i e no other 
agent in the set a 
is associated with an equal utility a deadlock 
can be formed only if we can create a cyclic sequence of agents in 
which any agent is waiting for a reply from the subsequent agent in 
the sequence however in our method any agent ai will be 
waiting for a reply from another agent aj to which it sent a commit 
message only if any agent ak ∈ a associated with a 
utility u ai ak u ai aj has already rejected the partnership 
with agent ai and agent aj itself is waiting for a reply from 
agent al where u al aj u aj ai therefore if we have a 
sequence of waiting agents then the utility associated with 
partnerships between any two subsequent agents in the sequence must 
increase along the sequence if the sequence is cyclic then we have a 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
pattern of the form u ai al u al aj u aj ai since 
u ai al u aj ai agent ai can be waiting for agent aj 
only if it has already been rejected by al see above however 
if agent al has rejected agent ai then it has also rejected agent 
aj therefore agent aj cannot be waiting for agent al to make a 
decision the same logic can be applied to any longer sequence 
the search activity is assumed to be costly in a way 
that any agent needs to consume some of its resources in order to 
locate other agents to interact with and for maintaining the 
interactions themselves we assume utilities and costs are additive and 
that the agents are trying to maximize their overall utility defined as 
the utility from the partnership formed minus the aggregated search 
costs along the search process the agent s cost of interacting with 
n other agents in parallel is given by the function c n the 
search cost structure is principally a parameter of the environment 
and thus shared by all agents 
an agent s strategy s a → commit aj ∈ a reject a ⊂ 
a n defines for any given set of partnership opportunities a 
what is the subset of opportunities that should be immediately 
declined to which agent to send a commit message if no pending 
notification from another agent is expected or the number of new 
interactions to initiate n since the search process is two-sided 
our goal is to find an equilibrium set of strategies for the agents 
 strategy structure 
recall that each agent declines partnerships based on a the 
partnerships immediate utility in comparison to the agent s expected 
utility from resuming search and b achieving a mutual 
commitment thus declining pending partnerships that were not rejected 
in a therefore an agent s strategy can be represented by a pair 
 nt 
 xt 
 where nt 
is the number of agents with whom it chooses 
to interact in search stage t and xt 
is its reservation value 
 a 
threshold for accepting rejecting the resulting n potential partnerships 
the subset a 
 thus will include all partnership opportunities of 
search stage t that are associated with a utility equal to or greater 
than xt 
 the reservation value xt 
is actually the expected utility for 
resuming the search at time t i e u resume the agent will 
always prefer committing to an opportunity greater than the expected 
utility of resuming the search and will always prefer to resume the 
search otherwise 
since the agents are not limited by a decision horizon and their 
search process does not imply any new information about the 
market structure e g about the utility distribution of future partnership 
opportunities their strategy is stationary - an agent will not accept 
an opportunity it has rejected beforehand i e x

 calculating acceptance probabilities 
the transition from instantaneous decision making process to a 
sequential one introduces several new difficulties in extracting the 
agents strategies now in order to estimate the probability of 
being accepted by any of the other agents the agent needs to 
recursively model while setting its strategy the probabilities of 
rejections other agents might face from other agents they interact with 
in the following paragraphs we introduce several complementary 
definitions and notations facilitating the formal introduction of the 
acceptance probabilities consider an agent ai using a strategy 
 n xn while operating in an environment where all other agents 
 
notice the reservation value used here is different from a reservation price 
concept that is usually used as buyers private evaluation the use of 
reservation-value based strategies is common in economic search models 
 
are using a strategy k xk the probability that agent ai will 
receive a commitment message from agent aj it interacted with 
depends on the utility associated with the potential partnership 
between them x this probability denoted by gk x can be 
calculated as

 otherwise 
 
the case where x xk above is trivial none of the other agents 
will accept agent ai if the utility in such a partnership is smaller 
than their reservation value xk however even when the 
partnership s utility is greater or equal to xk commitment is not 
guaranteed in the latter scenario a commitment message from agent aj 
will be received only if agent aj has been rejected by all other 
agents in its set a 
that were associated with a utility greater than 
the utility of a partnership with agent ai

notice that as expected a partnership opportunity that yields the

associated with a potential partnership opportunity is zero x the 
acceptance probability is non-negligible

this non-intuitive result derives from the fact that there is still a 
non-negligible probability that the other agent is rejected by all 
other agents it interacts with 
 setting the agents strategies 
using the function gk x we can now formulate and explore 
the agents expected utility when using their search strategies 
consider again an agent ai that is using a sample of size n while all 
other agents are using a strategy k xk we denote by rn x 
the probability that the maximum utility that agent ai can be 
guaranteed when interacting with n agents i e the highest utility to 
which a commit message will be received is at most x this can be 
calculated as the probability that none of n agents send agent ai a 
commit message for a partnership associated with a utility greater 
than x

notice that rn x is in fact a cumulative distribution function 
satisfying limx→∞ rn x and drn x dx the function 
never gets a zero value simply because there is always a positive 
probability that none of the agents commit at all to a partnership 
with agent ai therefore the derivative of the function rn x 
denoted rn x is in fact the probability distribution function of the 
maximum utility that can be guaranteed for agent ai when

the use of the recursive equation is enabled since we assume that the 
number of agents is infinite thus the probability of having an overlap 
between the interacting agents and the affect of such overlap on the 
probabilities we calculate become insignificant

the proof is obtained by deriving vn xn in equation and

we obtain and 
both parts of theorem can be used as an efficient means for 
extracting the optimal reservation value xn of an agent given the 
strategies of the other agents in the environment and the number 
of parallel interactions it uses furthermore in the case of 
complex distribution functions where extracting xn from equation 
is not immediate a simple algorithm principally based on binary

we apply the methodology used above in this subsection for

characteristics as reflected in theorem for comparative reasons we use 
the same synthetic environment that was used for the i-dm model 
 here the utilities are assumed to be drawn from a uniform 
distribution function and the cost function was taken to be c n 
 n the agent is using n while other agents 
are using k and xk the different curves depict the 
expected utility of the agent as a function of the reservation value 
x that it uses when a all agents are using the i-dm strategy 
 marked as i-dm b the agent is using the s-dm strategy while 
the other agents are using the i-dm strategy marked as 
i-dm sdm and c all agents are using the s-dm strategy marked as 
s-dm as expected according to equation and theorem the 
agent s expected utility remains constant until its reservation value 
exceeds xk then it reaches a global maximum when the 
reservation value satisfies vn x x from the graph we can see that the 
agent always has an incentive to deviate from the i-dm strategy to

 equilibrium dynamics 
since all agents are subject to similar search costs and their 
perceived utilities are drawn from the same distribution function they 
all share the same strategy in equilibrium a multi-equilibria 
scenario may occur however as we discuss in the following paragraphs 
since all agents share the same preferences priorities unlike for 
example in the famous battle of the sexes scenario we can 
always identify which equilibrium strategy will be used 
notice that if all agents are using the same sample size n then 
the value xn resulting from solving equation by substituting 
k n and xk xn is a stable reservation value i e none of the 
agents can benefit from changing just the value of xn 
an equilibrium strategy n xn can be found by identifying an 
n value for which no single agent has an incentive to use a different 
number of parallel interactions k and the new optimal reservation

value that is associated with k according to equation while 
this implies an infinite solution space we can always bound it 
using equations and within the framework of this paper we 
demonstrate such a bounding methodology for the common case 
were c n is linear 
or convex by using the following theorem 
theorem when c n is linear or convex then a when 
all other agents sample k potential partners over a search round 
if an agent s expected utility of sampling k potential partners 
vk xk is smaller than vk xk then the expected utility when 
sampling n potential partners vn xn where n k is also 
smaller than vk xk b similarly when all other agents sample 
k potential partners over a search round if an agent s expected 
utility of using k − potential partners vk− xk− is smaller 
than the expected utility when using k potential partners vk xk 
then the expected utility when using n potential partners where 
n k − is also smaller than vk xk 
proof let us use the notation ci for c i since vk xk xk ∀k 
 according to equation the claims are a if xk xk then 
xn xk for all n ≥ k and b if xk− xk then xn xk 
for all n ≤ k −

a linear cost function is mostly common in agent-based two-sided search 
applications since often the cost function can be divided into fixed costs

the above theorem supplies us with a powerful tool for 
eliminating non-equilibrium n values it suggests that we can check the 
stability of a sample size n and the appropriate reservation value 
xn simply by calculating the optimal reservation values of a 
single agent when deviating towards using samples of sizes n − 
and n keeping the other agents with strategy n xn if 
both the appropriate reservation values associated with the two 
latter sample sizes are smaller than xn then according to theorems 
 the same holds when deviating to any other sample size k the 
above process can be further simplified by using vn xn xn 
and vn− xn xn as the two elimination rules this derives 
from theorem and the properties of the function vn x found in 
theorem 
notice that a multi-equilibria scenario may occur however can 
easily be resolved if several strategies satisfy the stability 
condition defined above then the agents will always prefer the one 
associated with the highest expected utility therefore an algorithm 
that goes over the different n values and checks them according 
to the rules above can be applied assuming that we can bound the 
interval for searching the equilibrium n the following theorem 
 suggests such an upper bound 
theorem an upper bound for the equilibrium number of 
partners to be considered over a search round is the solution of the 
equation

clearly a n ≥ a n x ∀x since the integrand is positive hence 
if a n − c n then a n x − c n ∀x and vn x ∀x 
next we prove that if a n −c n gets negative it stays negative 
recalling that for any g y

which is always negative since the integrand is nonnegative 
therefore a n is concave since c n is convex −c n is 
concave and a sum of concave functions is concave we obtain that 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
a n − c n is concave this guarantees that once the 
concave expression a n − c n shifts from a positive value to a 
negative one with the increase in n it cannot become positive 
again therefore having n

 is an upper bound for n 
i e vn x ∀n ≥ n 
 the condition we specify for n 
is 
merely for ensuring that vn is switching from a positive value to a 
negative one and not vice versa and is trivial to implement 
given the existence of the upper bound we can design an 
algorithm for finding the equilibrium strategy if one exists the 
algorithm extracts the upper bound ˆn for the equilibrium 
number of parallel interactions according to theorem out of the set 
of values satisfying the stability condition defined above the 
algorithm chooses the one associated with the highest reservation value

the two-sided economic search for partnerships in ai literature 
is a sub-domain of coalition formation 
 while coalition 
formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes the 
partnership formation model often referred as matchmaking 
considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a 
partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the 
partnership to more than two agents e g in the case of 
buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications as in the general 
 
the use of the term partnership in this context refers to the agreement 
between two individual agents to cooperate in a pre-defined manner for 
example in the buyer-seller application a partnership is defined as an agreed 
transaction between the two-parties 
coalition formation case agents have the incentive to form 
partnerships when they are incapable of executing a task by their own 
or when the partnership can improve their individual utilities 
various centralized matching mechanisms can be found in the 
literature however in many mas environments in the 
absence of any reliable central matching mechanism the matching 
process is completely distributed 
while the search in agent-based environments is well recognized 
to be costly most of the proposed coalition formation 
mechanisms assume that an agent can scan as many partnership 
opportunities in its environment as needed or have access to central 
matchers or middle agents the incorporation of costly search 
in this context is quite rare and to the best of our knowledge a 
distributed two-sided search for partners model similar to the s-dm 
model has not been studied to date 
classical economic search theory and references therein 
widely addresses the problem of a searcher operating in a costly 
environment seeking to maximize his long term utility in these 
models classified as one-sided search the focus is on establishing the 
optimal strategies for the searcher assuming no mutual search 
activities i e no influence on the environment here the sequential 
search procedure is often applied allowing the searcher to 
investigate a single or multiple opportunities at a time while 
the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher it was 
never used in the two-sided search models that followed where 
dual search activities are modeled therefore in these 
models the equilibrium strategies are always developed based on 
the assumption that the agents interact with others sequentially i e 
with one agent at a time a first attempt to integrate the parallel 
search into a two-sided search model is given in as detailed in 
the introduction section 
several of the two-sided search essences can be found in the 
strategic theory of bargaining - both coalition formation and 
matching can be represented as a sequential bargaining game 
in which payoffs are defined as a function of the coalition structure 
and can be divided according to a fixed or negotiated division rule 
nevertheless in the sequential bargaining literature most emphasis 
is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process 
over the division of the utility or cost jointly owned by parties or 
the strategy the coalition needs to adopt the models 
presented in this area do not associate the coalition formation process 
with search costs which is the essence of the analysis that 
economic search theory aims to supply furthermore even in repeated 
pairwise bargaining models the agents are always limited to 
initiating a single bargaining interaction at a time 
 discussion and conclusions 
the phenomenal growth evidenced in recent years in the number 
of software agent-based applications alongside the continuous 
improvement in agents processing and communication capabilities 
suggest various incentives for agents to improve their search 
performance by applying advanced search strategies such as parallel 
search the multiple-interactions technique is known to be 
beneficial for agents both in one-sided and two-sided economic search 
 since it allows the agents to decrease their average cost 
of learning about potential partnerships and their values in this 
paper we propose a new parallel two-sided search mechanism that 
differs from the existing one in a sense that it allows the agents 
to delay their decision making process concerning the acceptance 
and rejection of potential partnerships as necessary this in 
comparison to the existing instantaneous model which force each 
agent to make a simultaneous decision concerning each of the 
potential partnerships revealed to it during the current search stage 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
as discussed throughout the paper the new method is much more 
intuitive to the agent than the existing model - an agent will always 
prefer to keep all options available furthermore as we prove in 
the former sections an agent s transition to the new search method 
always results with a better utility 
as we prove in section in spite of the transition to a sequential 
decision making deadlocks never occur in the proposed method as 
long as all agents use the proposed strategies since our analysis is 
equilibrium-based a deviation from the proposed strategies is not 
beneficial similarly we show that a deviation of a single agent 
 back to the instantaneous decision making strategy is not 
beneficial the only problem that may arise in the transition from an 
instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails 
 technically to function endlessly delaying the notification to the 
agents it interacted with while equilibrium analysis normally do 
not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy we do wish to 
emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved 
by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this 
agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded 
our analysis covers all aspects of the new two-sided search 
technique from individual strategy construction throughout the 
dynamics that lead to stability equilibrium the difficulty in the 
extraction of the agents equilibrium strategies in the new model derives 
from the need to recursively model while setting an agent s 
strategy the rejection other agents might face from other agents they 
interact with this complexity that does not exist in former 
models is resolved by the introduction of the recursive function gk x 
in section using the different theorems and propositions we 
prove we proffer efficient tools for calculating the agents 
equilibrium strategies our capabilities to produce an upper bound for 
the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium theorem 
and to quickly identify and eliminate non-equilibrium strategies 
 theorem resolves the problem of the computational complexity 
associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy 
space 
while the analysis we present is given in the context of software 
agents the model we suggest is general and can be applied to any 
two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can 
search in parallel in particular in addition to weakly dominating 
the instantaneous decision making model as we prove in the 
analysis section the proposed method weakly dominates the purely 
sequential two-sided search model where each agent interacts with 
only one other agent at a time this derives from the fact that 
the proposed method is a generalization of the latter i e in the 
worst case scenario the agent can interact with one other agent at 
a time in parallel 
naturally the attempt to integrate search theory techniques into 
day-to-day applications brings up the applicability question 
justification and legitimacy considerations for this integration were 
discussed in the wide literature we refer to throughout the paper the 
current paper is not focused on re-arguing applicability but rather 
on the improvement of the the core two-sided search model we 
see great importance in future research that will combine 
bargaining as part of the interaction process we believe such research can 
result in many rich variants of our two-sided search model
