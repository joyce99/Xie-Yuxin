 introduction 
much research has been undertaken to increase satellite 
autonomy such as enabling them to solve by themselves 
problems that may occur during a mission adapting their 
behaviour to new events and transferring planning on-board 
 even if the development cost of such a satellite is increased 
there is an increase in performance and mission possibilities 
 moreover the use of satellite swarms - sets of satellites 
flying in formation or in constellation around the 
earthmakes it possible to consider joint activities to distribute 
skills and to ensure robustness 
multi-agent architectures have been developed for satellite 
swarms but strong assumptions on deliberation 
and communication capabilities are made in order to build 
a collective plan 
mono-agent planning and task allocation 
are widely studied in a multi-agent context agents that 
build a collective plan must be able to change their goals 
reallocate resources and react to environment changes and 
to the others choices a coordination step must be added to 
the planning step however this step needs high 
communication and computation capabilities for instance 
coalition-based contract-based and all 
negotiationbased mechanisms need these capabilities especially in 
dynamic environments 
in order to relax communication constraints coordination 
based on norms and conventions or strategies are 
considered norms constraint agents in their decisions in 
such a way that the possibilities of conflicts are reduced 
strategies are private decision rules that allow an agent to 
draw benefit from the knowledgeable world without 
communication however communication is still needed in order to 
share information and build collective conjectures and plans 
communication can be achieved through a stigmergic 
approach via the environment or through message exchange 
and a protocol a protocol defines interactions between 
agents and cannot be uncoupled from its goal e g 
exchanging information finding a trade-off allocating tasks and so 
on protocols can be viewed as an abstraction of an 
interaction they may be represented in a variety of ways 
e g auml or petri-nets as protocols are 
originally designed for a single goal some works aim at 
endowing them with flexibility however an agent cannot 
always communicate with another agent or the 
communication possibilites are restricted to short time intervals 
the objective of this work is to use intersatellite 
connections called intersatellite links or isl in an earth 
observation constellation inspired from the fuego mission 
in order to increase the system reactivity and to improve the 
mission global return through a hybrid agent approach at 
the individual level agents are deliberative in order to create 
a local plan but at the collective level they use normative 
decision rules in order to coordinate with one another we 
will present the features of our problem a communication 
protocol a method for request allocation and finally 
collaboration strategies

 problem features 
an observation satellite constellation is a set of satellites 
in various orbits whose mission is to take pictures of various 
areas on the earth surface for example hot points 
corresponding to volcanos or forest fires the ground sends the 
constellation observation requests characterized by their 
geographical positions priorities specifying if the requests are 
urgent or not the desired dates of observation and the 
desired dates for data downloading 
the satellites are equipped with a single observation 
instrument whose mirror can roll to shift the line of sight a 
minimum duration is necessary to move the mirror so 
requests that are too close together cannot be realized by the 
same satellite the satellites are also equipped with a 
detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points 
and generates observation requests on-board 
the constellations that we consider are such as the orbits 
of the various satellites meet around the poles a judicious 
positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible 
to consider that two or more satellites meet in the polar 
areas and thus can communicate without the ground 
intervention intuitively intersatellite communication increases the 
reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within 
direct view of a ground station and thus can communicate 
with it only of the time 
the features of the problem are the following 
- to satellites in the constellation 
- pair communication around the poles 
- no ground intervention during the planning process 
- asynchronous requests with various priorities 
 a multi-agent approach 
as each satellite is a single entity that is a piece of the 
global swarm a multi-agent system fits to model satellite 
constellations this approach has been developped through 
the objectagent architecture teamagent dips 
 or prospecting ants 
 satellite swarm 
an observation satellite swarm 
is a multi-agent system 
where the requests do not have to be carried out in a fixed 
order and the agents the satellites do not have any physical 
interaction carrying out a request cannot prevent another 
agent from carrying out another one even the same one at 
most there will be a waste of resources formally a swarm 
is defined as follows 
definition swarm a satellite swarm e is a 
triplet s t vicinity 
- s is a set of n agents s sn 
- t ⊆ r 
or n 
is a set of dates with a total order 
- vicinity s × t → s 
 
in the sequel we will assume that the agents share a 
common clock 
for a given agent and a given time the vicinity relation 
returns the set of agents with whom it can communicate at 
that time as we have seen previously this relation exists 
when the agents meet 
 
this term will designate a satellite constellation with 
intersatellite links 
 requests 
requests are the observation tasks that the satellite swarm 
must achieve as we have seen previously the requests are 
generated both on the ground and on board each agent is 
allocated a set of initial requests during the mission new 
requests are sent to the agents by the ground or agents can 
generate new requests by themselves formally a request is 
defined as follows 
definition request a request r is defined as a 
tuple idr pos r prio r tbeg r br 
- idr is an identifier 
- pos r is the geographic position of r 
- prio r ∈ r is the request priority 
- tbeg r ∈ t is the desired date of observation 
- br ∈ true false specifies if r has been realized 
the priority prio r of a request represents how much it is 
important for the user namely the request sender that the 
request should be carried out thus a request with a high 
priority must be realized at all costs in our application 
priorities are comprised between and the highest 
in the sequel we will note rt 
si 
the set of the requests that 
are known by agent si at time t ∈ t 
for each request r in rt 
si 
 there is a cost value noted 
costsi r ∈ r representing how far from the desired date 
of observation tbeg r an agent si can realize r so the 
more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the 
desired date of observation the lower the cost value 
 candidacy 
an agent may have several intentions about a request i e 
for a request r an agent si may 
- propose to carry out r si may realize r 
- commit to carry out r si will realize r 
- not propose to carry out r si may not realize r 
- refuse to carry out r si will not realize r 
we can notice that these four propositions are modalities 
of proposition c si realizes r 
- c means that si proposes to carry out r 
- c means that si commits to carry out r 
- ¬ c means that si does not propose to carry out r 
- ¬ c means that si refuses to carry out r 
more formally 
definition candidacy a candidacy c is a tuple 
 idc modc sc rc obsc dnlc 
- idc is an identifier 
- modc ∈ ¬ ¬ is a modality 
- sc ∈ s is the candidate agent 
- rc ∈ rt 
sc 
is the request on which sc candidates 
- obsc ∈ t is the realization date proposed by sc 
- dnlc ∈ t is the download date 
 problem formalization 
then our problem is the following we would like each 
agent to build request allocations i e a plan dynamically 
such as if these requests are carried out their number is the 
highest possible or the global cost is minimal more formally 
definition problem let e be a swarm agents 
si in e must build a set at

let us notice that these criteria are not necessarily 
compatible 
as the choices of an agent will be influenced by the choices 
of the others it is necessary that the agents should reason 
on a common knowledge about the requests it is thus 
necessary to set up an effective communication protocol 
 communication protocol 
communication is commonly associated with cooperation 
deliberative agents need communication to cooperate 
whereas it is not necessarily the case for reactive agents 
gossip protocols or epidemic protocols are used 
to share knowledge with multicast each agent selects a set 
of agents at a given time in order to share information the 
speed of information transmission is contingent upon the 
length of the discussion round 
 the corridor metaphor 
the suggested protocol is inspired from what we name 
the corridor metaphor which represents well the satellite 
swarm problem various agents go to and fro in a corridor 
where objects to collect appear from time to time two 
objects that are too close to each other cannot be collected 
by the same agent because the action takes some time and 
an agent cannot stop its movement in order to optimize the 
collection the agents can communicate when they meet

example let us suppose three agents s s s and 
an object a to be collected at time t s did not collect a 
and s does not know that a exists when s meets s it 
communicates the list of the objects it knows that is to say 
a s now believes that a exists and prepares to collect it 
it is not certain that a is still there because another agent 
may have passed before s but it can take it into account in 
its plan 
at time t s collects a in the vicinity of s s 
communicates its list of objects and a is not in the list as both 
agents meet in a place where it is possible for s to have 
collected a the object would have been in the list if it had 
not been collected s can thus believe that a does not exist 
anymore and can withdraw it from its plan 
 knowledge to communicate 
in order to build up their plans agents need to know the 
current requests and the others agents intentions for each 
agent two kinds of knowledge to maintain are defined 
- requests definition 
- candidacies definition 
definition knowledge knowledge k is a tuple 
 data k sk tk 
- data k is a request r or a candidacy c 
- sk ⊆ s is the set of agents knowing k 
- tk ∈ t is a temporal timestamp 
in the sequel we will note kt 
si 
the knowledge of agent si 
at time t ∈ t 
 an epidemic protocol 
from the corridor metaphor we can define a 
communication protocol that benefits from all the communication 
opportunities an agent notifies any change within its 
knowledge and each agent must propagate these changes to its 
vicinity who update their knowledge bases and reiterate the 
process this protocol is a variant of epidemic protocols 
inspired from the work on overhearing 
protocol communication let si be an agent 
in s ∀t ∈ t 
- ∀ sj ∈ vicinity si t si executes 
 ∀ k ∈ kt 
si 
such as sj ∈ sk 
a si communicates k to sj 
b if sj acknowledges receipt of k sk ← sk ∪ sj 
- ∀ k ∈ kt 
si 
received by sj at time t 
 sj updates kt 
sj 
with k 
 sj acknowledges receipt of k to si 
two kinds of updates exist for an agent 
- an internal update from a knowledge modification by 
the agent itself 
- an external update from received knowledge 
for an internal update updating k depends on data k 
a candidacy c is modified when its modality changes and a 
request r is modified when an agent realizes it when k is 
updated the timestamp is updated too 
protocol internal update let si ∈ s be an 
agent an internal update from si at time t ∈ t is 
performed 
- when knowledge k is created 
- when data k is modified 
in both cases 
 tk ← t 
 sk ← si 
for an external update only the most recent knowledge k 
is taken into account because timestamps change only when 
data k is modified if k is already known it is updated 
if the content or the set of agents knowing it have been 
modified if k is unknown it is simply added to the agent s 
knowledge 
protocol external update let si be an agent 
and k the knowledge transmitted by agent sj ∀ k ∈ k the 
external update at time t ∈ t is defined as follows 
 if ∃ k ∈ kt 
si 
such as iddata k iddata k then 
a if tk ≥ tk then 
i if tk tk then sk ← sk ∪ si 
ii if tk tk then sk ← sk ∪ sk

if the incoming information has a more recent timestamp 
it means that the receiver agent has obsolete information 
consequently it replaces the old information by the new one 
and adds itself to the set of agents knowing k a i 
if both timestamps are the same both pieces of 
information are the same only the set of the agents knowing 
k may have changed because agents si and sj may have 
already transmitted the information to other agents 
consequently the sets of agents knowing k are unified a ii 
 properties 
communication between two agents when they meet is 
made of the conjunction of protocol and protocol in the 
sequel we call this conjunction a communication occurrence 
 convergence 
the structure of the transmitted information and the 
internal update mechanism protocol allow the process to 
converge indeed a request r can only be in two states 
 realized or not given by the boolean br once an internal 
update is made - i e r is realized - r cannot go back to its 
former state consequently an internal update can only be 
performed once 
as far as candidacies are concerned updates only modify 
the modalities which may change many times and go back to 
previous states then it seems that livelocks 
would be likely 
to appear however a candidacy c is associated to a request 
and a realization date the deadline given by obsc after 
the deadline the candidacy becomes meaningless thus for 
each candidacy there exists a date t ∈ t when changes will 
propagate no more 
 complexity 
it has been shown that in a set of n agents where a 
single one has a new piece of information an epidemic protocol 
takes o logn steps to broadcast the information 
during one step each agent has a communication occurrence 
as agents do not have much time to communicate such a 
communication occurrence must not have a too big temporal 
complexity which we can prove formally 
proposition the temporal complexity of a 
communication occurrence at time t ∈ t between two agents si and 
sj is for agent si

 on-board planning 
in space contexts present multi-agent 
architectures for on-board planning however they assume high 
communication and computation capabilities relax 
these constraints by cleaving planning modules on the first 
hand satellites have a planner that builds plans on a large 
horizon and on the second hand they have a decision 
module that enables them to choose to realize or not a planned 
observation 
in an uncertain environment such as the one of satellite 
swarms it may be advantageous to delay the decision until 
the last moment i e the realization date especially if there 
are several possibilities for a given request the main idea 
in contingency planning is to determine the nodes in 
the initial plan where the risks of failures are most important 
and to incrementally build contingency branches for these 
situations 
 a deliberative approach 
inspired from both approaches we propose to build 
allocations made up of a set of unquestionable requests and 
a set of uncertain disjunctive requests on which a decision 
will be made at the end of the decision horizon this 
horizon corresponds to the request realization date proposing 
such partial allocations allows conflicts to be solved locally 
without propagating them through the whole plan 
in order to build the agents initial plans let us assume 
that each agent is equipped with an on-board planner a 
plan is defined as follows 
definition plan let si be an agent rt 
si 
a set 
of requests and ct 
si 
a set of candidacies let us define three 
sets 
- the set of potential requests 
rp 
 r ∈ rt

 br false 
- the set of mandatory requests 
rm 
 r ∈ rp 
 ∃c ∈ ct

as rm

such as r ∈ at

 conflicts 
when two agents compare their respective plans some 
conflicts may appear it is a matter of redundancies between 
allocations on a given request i e several agents stand as 
candidates to carry out this request whereas such 
redundancies may sometimes be useful to ensure the realization of 
a request the realization may fail e g because of clouds 
it may also lead to a loss of opportunity consequently 
conflict has to be defined 
definition conflict let si and sj be two agents 
with at time t candidacies csi and csj respectively scsi 
 
si and scsj 
 sj si and sj are in conflict if and only if 
- rcsi 
 rcsj 
- modcsi 
and modcsj 
∈ 
let us notice that the agents have the means to know 
whether they are in conflict with another one during the 
communication process indeed they exchange information 
not only concerning their own plan but also concerning what 
they know about the other agents plans 
all the conflicts do not have the same strength meaning 
that they can be solved with more or less difficulty according 
to the agents communication capacities a conflict is soft 
when the concerned agents can communicate before one or 
the other carries out the request in question a conflict is 
hard when the agents cannot communicate before the 
realization of the request 
definition soft hard conflict let si and sj 
 i j two agents in conflict with at time t candidacies 
csi and csj respectively scsi 
 si and scsj 
 sj if ∃ 
v ⊆ s such as v si sj and if ∃ t ∈ t such as 
t ti− tj− ti− t where ∀ i ≤ k j sk ∈ 
vicinity sk tk with tk obscsi 
 tk obscsj 
and tk ≥ tk− 
then the conflict is soft else it is hard 
a conflict is soft if it exists a chain of agents between the 
two agents in conflict such as information can propagate 
before both agents realize the request if this chain does not 
exist it means that the agents in conflict cannot 
communicate directly or not consequently the conflict is hard 
in satellite swarms the geographical positions of the 
requests are known as well as the satellite orbits so each 
agent is able to determine if a conflict is soft or hard 
we can define the conflict cardinality 
definition conflict cardinality let si be an 
agent and r a request in conflict the conflict cardinality 
is cardc r c ∈ ct 
si 
 modc ∈ cr r 
the conflict cardinality corresponds to the number of agents 
that are candidates or committed to the same request thus 
a conflict has at least a cardinality of 
 collaboration strategies 
in space contexts communication time and agents 
computing capacities are limited when they are in conflict the 
agents must find a local agreement instead of an expensive 
global agreement by using the conflict in order to increase 
the number of realized requests to decrease the time of 
mission return to increase the quality of the pictures taken or 
to make sure that a request is carried out 
example let us suppose a conflict on request r 
between agents si and sj we would like that the most expert 
agent i e the agent that can carry out the request under 
the best conditions does it let us suppose si is the expert 
si must allocate r to itself it remains to determine what 
sj must do sj can either select a substitute for r in order 
to increase the number of requests potentially realized or do 
nothing in order to preserve resources or allocate r to itself 
to ensure redundancy 
consequently we can define collaboration strategies 
dedicated to conflict solving a strategy is a private namely 
intrinsic to an agent decision process that allows an agent 
to make a decision on a given object in our application 
strategies specify what to do with redundancies 
 cost and expertise 
in our application cost is linked to the realization dates 
carrying out a request consumes the agents resources e g 
on-board energy memory consequently an observation 
has a cost for each agent which depends on when it is 
realized the closer the realization date to the desired date of 
observation the lower the cost 
definition cost let si be an agent the cost 
costsi rc ∈ r to carry out a request rc according to a 
candidacy c is defined as costsi rc obsc − tbeg rc 
from this cost notion we can formally define an expert 
notion between two agents the expertise for an agent means 
it can realize the request at the lower cost 
definition expertise let si and sj ∈ s be two 
agents and r a request agent si is an expert for r if and 
only if costsi r ≤ costsj r 
 soft conflict solving strategies 
three strategies are proposed to solve a conflict the 
expert strategy means that the expert agent maintains its 
candidacy whereas the other one gives up the altruist strategy 
means that the agent that can download first 
 provided the 
cost increase is negligible maintains its candidacy whereas 
the other one gives up the insurance strategy means that 
both agents maintain their candidacies in order to ensure 
redundancy 
strategy expert let si and sj be two agents in 
conflict on their respective candidacies csi and csj such as 
si is the expert agent the expert strategy is modcsi 
 
and modcsj 
 ¬ 
strategy altruist let si and sj be two agents 
in conflict on their respective candidacies csi and csj such 
as si is the expert agent let ∈ r 
be a threshold on the 
cost increase the altruist strategy is if dnlcsi 
 dnlcsj 
and costsi r − costsj r then modcsi 
 ¬ and 
modcsj 
 
strategy insurance let si and sj be two agents 
in conflict on their respective candidacies csi and csj such 
as si is the expert agent let α ∈ r be a priority threshold 
the insurance strategy is if prio r 
cardc r − 
 α then modcsi 
 and modcsj 
 
 
i e the agent using memory resources during a shorter 
time 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
in the insurance strategy redundancy triggering is 
adjusted by the conflict cardinality cardc r the reason is 
the following the more redundancies on a given request 
the less a new redundancy on this request is needed 
the three strategies are implemented in a negotiation 
protocol dedicated to soft conflicts the protocol is based on 
a subsumption architecture on strategies the insurance 
strategy is the major strategy because it ensures 
redundancy for which the swarm is implemented then the 
altruist strategy comes in order to allocate the resources so as 
to enhance the mission return finally the expert strategy 
that does not have preconditions enhances the cost of 
the plan 
protocol soft conflict solving let r be a 
request in a soft conflict between two agents si and sj 
these agents have csi and csj for respective candidacies 
let si be the expert agent agents apply strategies as 
follows 
 insurance strategy α 
 altruist strategy 
 expert strategy 
the choice of parameters α and allows to adjust the 
protocol results for example if the altruist strategy 
is never used 
 hard conflict solving strategies 
in case of a hard conflict the agent that is not aware will 
necessarily realize the request with success or not 
consequently a redundancy is useful only if the other agent is 
more expert or if the priority of the request is high enough to 
need redundancy therefore we will use the insurance 
strategy refer to section and define a competitive strategy 
the latter is defined for two agents si and sj in a hard 
conflict on a request r let si be the agent that is aware of 
the conflict 
 
strategy competitive let λ ∈ r 
be an cost 
threshold the competitive strategy is if costsi r costsj 
 r − λ then modcsi 
 
protocol hard conflict solving let si be an 
agent in a hard conflict with an agent sj on a request r si 
applies strategies as follows 
 insurance strategy α 
 competitive strategy λ 
 withdrawal modcsi

 generalization 
although agents use pair communication they may have 
information about several agents and conflict cardinality 
may be more than therefore we define a k-conflict as 
a conflict with a cardinality of k on a set of agents 
proposing or committing to realize the same request formally 
definition k-conflict let s s sk be a 
set of agents with respective candidacies cs csk at time 
t the set s is in a k-conflict if and only if 
- ∀ ≤ i ≤ k scsi 
 si 
- ∃r such as ∀ ≤ i ≤ k rcsi 
 r 
 
i e the agent that must make a decision on r 
- ∀ ≤ i ≤ k modcsi 
∈ 
- s is maximal ⊆ among the sets that satisfy these 
properties 
as previously a k-conflict can be soft or hard a k-conflict 
is soft if each pair conflict in the k-conflict is a soft conflict 
with respect to definition 
as conflicts bear on sets of agents expertise is a total 
order on agents we define rank-i-expertise where the 
concerned agent is the ith expert 
in case of a soft k-conflict the rank-i-expert agent makes 
its decision with respect to the rank- i -expert agent 
according to protocol the protocol is applied recursively 
and α and parameters are updated at each step in order 
to avoid cost explosion 
 
in case of a hard conflict the set s of agents in conflict 
can be splitted in ss 
 the subset of agents in a soft conflict 
and sh 
 the subset of unaware agents only agents in ss 
can take a decision and must adapt themselves to agents in 
sh 
 the rank-i-expert agent in ss 
uses protocol on the 
whole set sh 
and the rank- i − -expert agent in ss 
 if an 
agent in ss 
applies the competitive strategy all the others 
withdraws 
 experiments 
satellite swarm simulations have been implemented in 
java with the jade platform the on-board planner is 
implemented with linear programming using ilog cplex 
 the simulation scenario implements satellites on 
 hour orbits two scenarios have been considered the first 
one with a set of requests with low mutual exclusion and 
conflict rate and the second one with a set of requests 
with high mutual exclusion and conflict rate 
for each scenario six simulations have been performed 
one with centralized planning all requests are planned by 
the ground station before the simulation one where agents 
are isolated they cannot communicate nor coordinate with 
one another one informed simulation agents only 
communicate requests and three other simulations implementing 
the instanciated collaboration strategies politics 
- neutral politics α and λ are set to average values 
- drastic politics α and λ are set to higher values i e 
agents will ensure redundancy only if the priorities are high 
and in case of a hard conflict if the cost payoff is much 
higher 
- lax politics α is set to a lower value i e redundancies 
are more frequent 
in the case of low mutual exclusion and conflict rate 
 table centralized and isolated simulations lead to the same 
number of observations with the same average priorities 
isolation leading to a lower cost is due to the high 
number of redundancies many agents carry out the same 
request at different costs the informed simulation reduces 
the number of redundancies but sligthly increases the 
average cost for the same reason we can notice that the use of 
 
for instance the rank- -expert agent withdraws due to the 
altruist strategy and the cost increases by in the worst 
case then rank- -expert agent withdraws due to the altruist 
strategy and the cost increases by in the worst case so 
the cost has increased by in the worst case

table scenario - the -request simulation results 
collaboration strategies allows the number of redundancies 
to be much more reduced but the number of observations 
decreases owing to the constraint created by commitments 
furthermore the average cost is increased too nevertheless 
each avoided redundancy corresponds to saved resources to 
realize on-board generated requests during the simulation 
in the case of high mutual exclusion and conflict rate 
 table noteworthy differences exist between the centralized 
and isolated simulations we can notice that all informed 
simulations with or without strategies allow to perform 
more observations than isolated agents do with less 
redundancies likewise we can notice that all politics reduce the 
average cost contrary to the first scenario the drastic 
politics is interesting because not only does it allow to perform 
more observations than isolated agents do but it allows to 
highly reduce the average cost with the lowest number of 
redundancies 
as far as the number of exchanged messages is concerned 
there are meetings between agents during the 
simulations in the worst case at each meeting each agent sends 
n pieces of information on the requests plus n pieces of 
information on the agents intentions plus message for the 
end of communication where n is the total number of 
requests consequently messages are exchanged in the 
worst case for the -request simulations and messages 
for the -request simulations these numbers are much 
higher than the number of messages that are actually 
exchanged we can notice that the informed simulations that 
communicate only requests allow a higher reduction 
in the general case using communication and strategies 
allows to reduce redundancies and saves resources but 
increases the average cost if a request is realized agents that 
know it do not plan it even if its cost can be reduce 
afterwards it is not the case with isolated agents using 
strategies on little constrained problems such as scenario 
constrains the agents too much and causes an additional cost 
increase strategies are more useful on highly constrained 
problems such as scenario although agents constrain 
themselves on the number of observations the average cost 
is widely reduce 
 conclusion and future work 
an observation satellite swarm is a cooperative 
multiagent system with strong constraints in terms of 
communication and computation capabilities in order to increase 
the global mission outcome we propose an hybrid approach 
deliberative for individual planning and reactive for 
collaboration 
agents reason both on requests to carry out and on the 
other agents intentions candidacies an epidemic 
communication protocol uses all communication opportunities 
to update this information reactive decision rules 
 strategies are proposed to solve conflicts that may arise between 
agents through the tuning of the strategies α and λ 
and their plastic interlacing within the protocol it is 
possible to coordinate agents without additional communication 
the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same 
between informed simulations and simulations implementing 
strategies 
some simulations have been made to experimentally 
validate these protocols and the first results are promising but 
raise many questions what is the trade-off between the 
constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategies 
to what extent are the number of redundancies and the 
average cost affected by the tuning of the strategies 
future works will focus on new strategies to solve new 
conflicts specially those arising when relaxing the 
independence assumption between the requests a second point is 
to take into account the complexity of the initial planning 
problem indeed the chosen planning approach results in a 
combinatory explosion with big sets of requests an anytime 
or a fully reactive approach has to be considered for more 
complex problems
