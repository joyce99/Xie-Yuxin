abstract 
in this work we study cost sharing connection games where 
each player has a source and sink he would like to connect 
and the cost of the edges is either shared equally fair 
connection games or in an arbitrary way general connection 
games we study the graph topologies that guarantee the 
existence of a strong equilibrium where no coalition can 
improve the cost of each of its members regardless of the 
specific costs on the edges 
our main existence results are the following for a 
single source and sink we show that there is always a strong 
equilibrium both for fair and general connection games 
 for a single source multiple sinks we show that for a 
series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists both 
for fair and general connection games for multi source 
and sink we show that an extension parallel graph always 
admits a strong equilibrium in fair connection games 
as for the quality of the strong equilibrium we show that 
in any fair connection games the cost of a strong equilibrium 
is θ log n from the optimal solution where n is the number 
of players this should be contrasted with the ω n price 
of anarchy for the same setting for single source general 
connection games and single source single sink fair 
connection games we show that a strong equilibrium is always an 
optimal solution

 introduction 
computational game theory has introduced the issue of 
incentives to many of the classical combinatorial 
optimization problems the view that the demand side is many times 
not under the control of a central authority that optimizes 
the global performance but rather under the control of 
individuals with different incentives has led already to many 
important insights 
consider classical routing and transportation problems 
such as multicast or multi-commodity problems which are 
many times viewed as follows we are given a graph with 
edge costs and connectivity demands between nodes and 
our goal is to find a minimal cost solution the classical 
centralized approach assumes that all the individual demands 
can both be completely coordinated and have no individual 
incentives the game theory point of view would assume 
that each individual demand is controlled by a player that 
optimizes its own utility and the resulting outcome could 
be far from the optimal solution 
when considering individual incentives one needs to 
discuss the appropriate solution concept much of the research 
in computational game theory has focused on the classical 
nash equilibrium as the primary solution concept indeed 
nash equilibrium has many benefits and most importantly 
it always exists in mixed strategies however the solution 
concept of nash equilibrium is resilient only to unilateral 
deviations while in reality players may be able to coordinate 
their actions 
a strong equilibrium is a state from which no coalition 
 of any size can deviate and improve the utility of every 
member of the coalition while possibly lowering the utility 
 
of players outside the coalition this resilience to 
deviations by coalitions of the players is highly attractive and 
one can hope that once a strong equilibrium is reached it is 
highly likely to sustain from a computational game theory 
point of view an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium 
is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the 
optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome 
of selfish behavior the strong price of anarchy spoa 
introduced in is the ratio between the cost of the worst 
strong equilibrium and the cost of an optimal solution 
obviously spoa is meaningful only in those cases where 
a strong equilibrium exists a major downside of strong 
equilibrium is that most games do not admit any strong 
equilibrium even simple classical games like the prisoner s 
dilemma do not posses any strong equilibrium which is also 
an example of a congestion game that does not posses a 
strong equilibrium 
 this unfortunate fact has reduced the 
concentration in strong equilibrium despite its highly 
attractive properties yet have identified two broad 
families of games namely job scheduling and network formation 
where a strong equilibrium always exists and the spoa is 
significantly lower than the price of anarchy which is the 
ratio between the worst nash equilibrium and the optimal 
solution 
in this work we concentrate on cost sharing connection 
games introduced by in such a game there is an 
underlying directed graph with edge costs and individual 
users have connectivity demands between a source and a 
sink we consider two models the fair cost connection 
model allows each player to select a path from the source 
to the sink 
 in this game the cost of an edge is shared 
equally between all the players that selected the edge and 
the cost of the player is the sum of its costs on the edges it 
selected the general connection game allows each player 
to offer prices for edges in this game an edge is bought if 
the sum of the offers at least covers its cost and the cost of 
the player is the sum of its offers on the bought edges in 
both games we assume that the player has to guarantee the 
connectivity between its source and sink 
in this work we focus on two important issues the first 
one is identifying under what conditions the existence of a 
strong equilibrium is guaranteed and the second one is the 
quality of the strong equilibria for the existence part we 
identify families of graph topologies that possess some strong 
equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs one can view 
this separation between the graph topology and the edge 
costs as a separation between the underlying infrastructure 
and the costs the players observe to purchase edges while 
one expects the infrastructure to be stable over long periods 
of time the costs the players observe can be easily modified 
over short time periods such a topological characterization 
of the underlying infrastructure provides a network designer 
topological conditions that will ensure stability in his 
network 
our results are as follows for the single commodity case 
 all the players have the same source and sink there is a 
strong equilibrium in any graph both for fair and general 
connection games moreover the strong equilibrium is also 
 
while any congestion game is known to admit at least one 
nash equilibrium in pure strategies 
 
the fair cost sharing scheme is also attractive from a 
mechanism design point of view as it is a strategyproof 
costsharing mechanism 
the optimal solution namely the players share a shortest 
path from the common source to the common sink for 
the case of a single source and multiple sinks for 
example in a multicast tree we show that in a fair connection 
game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph 
is a series parallel graph and we show an example of a 
nonseries parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium 
for the case of multi-commodity multi sources and sinks 
we show that in a fair connection game if the graph is an 
extension parallel graph then there is always a strong 
equilibrium and we show an example of a series parallel graph 
that does not have a strong equilibrium as far as we know 
we are the first to provide a topological characterization for 
equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source 
network games 
for any fair connection game we show that if there exists 
a strong equilibrium it is at most a factor of θ log n from 
the optimal solution where n is the number of players this 
should be contrasted with the θ n bound that exists for the 
price of anarchy 
for single source general connection games we show that 
any series parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium and 
we show an example of a graph that does not have a strong 
equilibrium in this case we also show that any strong 
equilibrium is optimal 
related work 
topological characterizations for single-commodity network 
games have been recently provided for various equilibrium 
properties including equilibrium existence 
equilibrium uniqueness and equilibrium efficiency the 
existence of pure nash equilibrium in single-commodity 
network congestion games with player-specific costs or weights 
was studied in the existence of strong equilibrium 
was studied in both utility-decreasing e g routing and 
utility-increasing e g fair cost-sharing congestion games 
 have provided a full topological characterization for 
a se existence in single-commodity utility-decreasing 
congestion games and showed that a se always exists if and 
only if the underlying graph is extension-parallel have 
shown that in single-commodity utility-increasing 
congestion games the topological characterization is essentially 
equivalent to parallel links in addition they have shown 
that these results hold for correlated strong equilibria as 
well in contrast to the decreasing setting where correlated 
strong equilibria might not exist at all while the fair cost 
sharing games we study are utility increasing network 
congestion games we derive a different characterization than 
 due to the different assumptions regarding the players 
actions 
 model 
 game theory definitions 
a game λ n σi ci has a finite set n n 
of players player i ∈ n has a set σi of actions the joint 
action set is σ σ × · · · × σn and a joint action s ∈ σ 
is also called a profile the cost function of player i is 
 
in they allow to restrict some players from using certain 
links even though the links exist in the graph while we do 
not allow this and assume that the available strategies for 
players are fully represented by the underlying graph 
 
ci σ → r 
 which maps the joint action s ∈ σ to a 
non-negative real number let s s sn denote 
the profile of actions taken by the players and let s−i 
 s si− si sn denote the profile of actions taken 
by all players other than player i note that s si s−i 
the social cost of a game λ is the sum of the costs of 
the players and we denote by opt λ the minimal social 
cost of a game λ i e opt λ mins∈σ costλ s where 
costλ s i∈n ci s 
a joint action s ∈ σ is a pure nash equilibrium if no player 
i ∈ n can benefit from unilaterally deviating from his action 
to another action i e ∀i ∈ n ∀si ∈ σi ci s−i si ≥ 
ci s we denote by ne λ the set of pure nash equilibria 
in the game λ 
resilience to coalitions a pure deviation of a set of 
players γ ⊂ n also called coalition specifies an action for each 
player in the coalition i e γ ∈ ×i∈γσi a joint action s ∈ 
σ is not resilient to a pure deviation of a coalition γ if there 
is a pure joint action γ of γ such that ci s−γ γ ci s for 
every i ∈ γ i e the players in the coalition can deviate in 
such a way that each player in the coalition reduces its cost 
a pure nash equilibrium s ∈ σ is a k-strong equilibrium if 
there is no coalition γ of size at most k such that s is not 
resilient to a pure deviation by γ we denote by k-se λ 
the set of k-strong equilibria in the game λ we denote by 
se λ the set of n-strong equilibria and call s ∈ se λ a 
strong equilibrium se 
next we define the price of anarchy price of 
stability and their extension to strong price of anarchy 
and strong price of stability of anarchy k-spoa for the 
game λ the price of anarchy poa is the ratio between 
the maximal cost of a pure nash equilibrium assuming one 
exists and the social optimum i e maxs∈ne λ costλ s 
 opt λ similarly the price of stability pos is the 
ratio between the minimal cost of a pure nash equilibrium and 
the social optimum i e mins∈ne λ costλ s opt λ the 
k-strong price of anarchy k-spoa is the ratio between 
the maximal cost of a k-strong equilibrium assuming one 
exists and the social optimum i e maxs∈k-se λ costλ s 
 opt λ the spoa is the n-spoa similarly the strong 
price of stability spos is the ratio between the minimal 
cost of a pure strong equilibrium and the social optimum 
i e mins∈se λ costλ s opt λ note that both k-spoa 
and spos are defined only if some strong equilibrium exists 
 cost sharing connection games 
a cost sharing connection game has an underlying 
directed graph g v e where each edge e ∈ e has an 
associated cost ce ≥ 
 in a connection game each player 
i ∈ n has an associated source si and sink ti 
in a fair connection game the actions σi of player i 
include all the paths from si to ti the cost of each edge is 
shared equally by the set of all players whose paths 
contain it given a joint action the cost of a player is the 
sum of his costs on the edges it selected more formally 
the cost function of each player on an edge e in a joint 
action s is fe ne s ce 
ne s 
 where ne s is the 
number of players that selected a path containing edge e in 
s the cost of player i when selecting path qi ∈ σi is 
ci s e∈qi 
fe ne s 
 
in some of the existence proofs we assume that ce for 
simplicity the full version contains the complete proofs for 
the case ce ≥ 
in a general connection game the actions σi of player i 
is a payment vector pi where pi e is how much player i 
is offering to contribute to the cost of edge e 
given a 
profile p any edge e such that i pi e ≥ ce is considered 
bought and ep denotes the set of bought edges let gp 
 v ep denote the graph bought by the players for profile 
p p pn clearly each player tries to minimize his 
total payment which is ci p e∈ep 
pi e if si is connected 
to ti in gp and infinity otherwise 
we denote by c p 
i ci p the total cost under the profile p for a subgraph 
h of g we denote the total cost of the edges in h by c h 
a symmetric connection game implies that the source and 
sink of all the players are identical we also call a 
symmetric connection game a single source single sink connection 
game or a single commodity connection game a single 
source connection game implies that the sources of all the 
players are identical finally a multi commodity connection 
game implies that each player has its own source and sink 
 extension parallel and series parallel 
directed graphs 
our directed graphs would be acyclic and would have 
a source node from which all nodes are reachable and a 
sink node which every node can reach we first define the 
following actions for composition of directed graphs 
 identification the identification operation allows to 
collapse two nodes to one more formally given graph 
g v e we define the identification of a node v ∈ 
v and v ∈ v forming a new node v ∈ v as creating a 
new graph g v e where v v − v v ∪ v 
and e includes the edges of e where the edges of v 
and v are now connected to v 
 parallel composition given two directed graphs g 
 v e and g v e with sources s ∈ v and 
s ∈ v and sinks t ∈ v and t ∈ v respectively 
we define a new graph g g g as follows let 
g v ∪ v e ∪ e be the union graph to create 
g g g we identify the sources s and s forming 
a new source node s and identify the sinks t and t 
forming a new sink t 
 series composition given two directed graphs g 
 v e and g v e with sources s ∈ v and 
s ∈ v and sinks t ∈ v and t ∈ v respectively we 
define a new graph g g → g as follows let g 
 v ∪ v e ∪ e be the union graph to create g 
g → g we identify the vertices t and s forming a 
new vertex u the graph g has a source s s and a 
sink t t 
 extension composition a series composition when 
one of the graphs g or g is composed of a 
single directed edge is an extension composition and we 
denote it by g g →e g 
an extension parallel graph epg is a graph g consisting 
of either a single directed edge s t a graph g 
g g or a graph g g →e g where g and g are 
 
we limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti 
and payment only on those edges 
 
this implies that in equilibrium every player has its sink 
and source connected by a path in gp 
 
extension parallel graphs and in the extension composition 
either g or g is a single edge a series parallel graph 
 spg is a graph g consisting of either a single directed 
edge s t a graph g g g or a graph g g → 
g where g and g are series parallel graphs 
given a path q and two vertices u v on q we denote the 
subpath of q from u to v by qu v the following lemma 
whose proof appears in the full version would be the main 
topological tool in the case of single source graph 
lemma let g be an spg with source s and sink t 
given a path q from s to t and a vertex t there exist a 
vertex y ∈ q such that for any path q from s to t the path 
q contains y and the paths qy t and q are edge disjoint 
 we call the vertex y the intersecting vertex of q and t 
 fair connection games 
this section derives our results for fair connection games 
 existence of strong equilibrium 
while it is known that every fair connection game 
possesses a nash equilibrium in pure strategies this is not 
necessarily the case for a strong equilibrium in this section 
we study the existence of strong equilibrium in fair 
connection games we begin with a simple case showing that every 
symmetric fair connection game possesses a strong 
equilibrium 
theorem in every symmetric fair connection game 
there exists a strong equilibrium 
proof let s be the source and t be the sink of all the 
players we show that a profile s in which all the players 
choose the same shortest path q from the source s to the 
sink t is a strong equilibrium suppose by contradiction 
that s is not a se then there is a coalition γ that can 
deviate to a new profile s such that the cost of every player 
j ∈ γ decreases let qj be a new path used by player j ∈ γ 
since q is a shortest path it holds that c qj \ q ∩ qj ≥ 
c q \ q ∩ qj for any path qj therefore for every player 
j ∈ γ we have that cj s ≥ cj s however this contradicts 
the fact that all players in γ reduce their cost in fact no 
player in γ has reduced its cost 
while every symmetric fair connection game admits a se 
it does not hold for every fair connection game in what 
follows we study the network topologies that admit a strong 
equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs and give 
examples of topologies for which a strong equilibrium does not 
exist the following lemma whose proof appears in the full 
version plays a major role in our proofs of the existence of 
se 
lemma let λ be a fair connection game on a series 
parallel graph g with source s and sink t assume that player 
i has si s and ti t and that λ has some se let s be 
a se that minimizes the cost of player i out of all se 
i e ci s mint ∈se λ ci t and let s 
be the profile that 
minimizes the cost of player i out of all possible profiles 
i e ci s 
 mint ∈σ ci t then ci s ci s 
 
the next lemma considers parallel composition 
lemma let λ be a fair connection game on graph 
g g g where g and g are series parallel graphs if 
every fair connection game on the graphs g and g 
possesses a strong equilibrium then the game λ possesses a 
strong equilibrium 
proof let g v e and g v e have sources 
s and s and sinks t and t respectively let ti be the 
set of players with an endpoint in vi \ s t for i ∈ 
 an endpoint is either a source or a sink of a player let 
t be the set of players j such that sj s and tj t let 
λ and λ be the original game on the respective graphs g 
and g with players t ∪ t and t ∪ t respectively 
let s and s be the se in λ and λ that minimizes 
the cost of players in t respectively assume w l o g that 
ci s ≤ ci s where player i ∈ t in addition let λ be 
the game on the graph g with players t and let ¯s be a 
se in λ 
we will show that the profile s s ∪ ¯s is a se in λ 
suppose by contradiction that s is not a se then there 
is a coalition γ that can deviate such that the cost of every 
player j ∈ γ decreases by lemma and the assumption 
that ci s ≤ ci s a player j ∈ t cannot improve his 
cost therefore γ ⊆ t ∪ t but this is a contradiction to 
s being a se in λ or ¯s being a se in λ 
the following theorem considers the case of single source 
fair connection games 
theorem every single source fair connection game 
on a series-parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium 
proof we prove the theorem by induction on the 
network size v the claim obviously holds if v we 
show the claim for a series composition i e g g → g 
and for a parallel composition i e g g g where 
g v e and g v e are spg s with sources 
s s and sinks t t respectively 
series composition let g g → g let t be 
the set of players j such that tj ∈ v and t be the set of 
players j such that tj ∈ v \ s 
let λ and λ be the original game on the respective 
graphs g and g with players t ∪ t and t respectively 
for every player i ∈ t with action si in the game λ let 
si ∩e be his induced action in the game λ and let si ∩e 
be his induced action in the game λ 
let s be a se in λ that minimizes the cost of players in 
t such a se exists by the induction hypothesis and lemma 
 let s be any se in λ we will show that the profile 
s s ∪ s is a se in the game λ i e for player j ∈ t we 
use the profile sj sj ∪ sj 
suppose by contradiction that s is not a se then there 
is a coalition γ that can deviate such that the cost of every 
player j ∈ γ decreases now there are two cases 
case γ ⊆ t this is a contradiction to s being a se 
case there exists a player j ∈ γ ∩ t by lemma 
player j cannot improve his cost in λ so the improvement 
is due to λ consider the coalition γ ∩ t it would still 
improve its cost however this contradicts the fact that s 
is a se in λ 
parallel composition follows from lemma 
while multi-commodity fair connection games on series 
parallel graphs do not necessarily possess a se see 
theorem fair connection games on extension parallel graphs 
always possess a strong equilibrium

extension parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium

network size v let λ be a fair connection game on an epg 
g v e the claim obviously holds if v if the 
graph g is a parallel composition of two epg graphs g 
and g then the claim follows from lemma it remains 
to prove the claim for extension composition suppose the 
graph g is an extension composition of the graph g 
consisting of a single edge e s t and an epg g v e 
with terminals s t such that s s and t t the case 
that g is a single edge is similar 
let t be the set of players with source s and sink t 
 i e their path is in g let t be the set of players with 
source and sink in g let t be the set of players with 
source s and sink in v \ t 
let λ and λ be the original game on the respective 
graphs g and g with players t ∪ t and t ∪ t 
respectively let s s be se in λ and λ respectively we will 
show that the profile s s ∪ s is a se in the game λ 
suppose by contradiction that s is not a se then there is 
a coalition γ of minimal size that can deviate such that the 
cost of any player j ∈ γ decreases clearly t ∩γ φ since 
players in t have a single strategy hence γ ⊆ t ∪t any 
player j ∈ t ∪t cannot improve his cost in λ therefore 
any player j ∈ t ∪ t improves his cost in λ however 
this contradicts the fact that s is a se in λ 
in the following theorem we provide a few examples of 
topologies in which a strong equilibrium does not exist 
showing that our characterization is almost tight 
theorem the following connection games exist 
there exists a multi-commodity fair connection game on a 
series parallel graph that does not possess a strong 
equilibrium there exists a single source fair connection game 
that does not possess a strong equilibrium 
proof for claim consider the graph depicted in 
figure a this game has a unique ne where s e c 
s b f and each player has a cost of 
however 
consider the following coordinated deviation s s a b c 
 
in any ne of the game player will buy the edge e and 
player will buy the edge f this is since the alternate 
path in the respective part will cost the player thus 
player player will buy the edge c edge b alone and 
each player will have a cost of

price of anarchy is bounded by h n n

theorem the strong price of anarchy of a fair

proof let λ be a fair connection game on the graph g 
we denote by λ γ the game played on the graph g by a set 
of players γ where the action of player i ∈ γ remains σi the 
same as in λ let s s sn be a profile in the game 
λ we denote by s γ sγ the induced profile of players in 
γ in the game λ γ let ne s γ denote the load of edge 
e under the profile s γ in the game λ γ i e ne s γ 
 j j ∈ γ e ∈ sj similar to congestion games we 
denote by φ s γ the potential function of the profile s γ 
in the game λ γ where φ s γ e∈e

let s be a se and let s 
be the profile of the optimal 
solution we define an order on the players as follows let 
γn n be the set of all the players for each k 
 
we can show that this is the unique ne by a simple case 
analysis i if s h f d and s h f e then player 
 can deviate to s h g and decrease his cost ii if 
s h g and s h f e then player can deviate to 
s a c and decrease his cost iii if s h g and 
s a c then player can deviate to s a b and 
decrease his cost 
 
n since s is a se there exists a player in γk w l o g 
call it player k such that 
ck s ≤ ck s−γk s

in this way γk is defined recursively such that for every 
k n it holds that γk− γk \ k i e after the 
renaming γk k 
let ck s γk denote the cost of player k in the game 
λ γk under the induced profile s γk it is easy to see that

proof let s be a se of λ and s 
be the profile of the 
optimal solution of λ to simplify the proof we assume that 
n k is an integer we partition the players to n k groups 
t tn k each of size k let λj be the game on the 
graph g played by the set of players tj let s tj denote 
the profile of the k players in tj in the game λj induced by 
the profile s of the game λ by theorem it holds that

the results of theorems and can be extended to 
concave cost functions consider the extended fair 
connection game where each edge has a cost which depends on the 
number of players using that edge ce ne we assume that 
the cost function ce ne is a nondecreasing concave 
function note that the cost of an edge ce ne might increase 
with the number of players using it but the cost per player 
fe ne ce ne ne decreases when ce ne is concave 
theorem the strong price of anarchy of a fair 
connection game with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions 
and n players is at most h n 
proof the proof is analogues to the proof of 
theorem for the proof we show that cost s ≤ φ s 
 ≤ 
h n ·cost s 
 we first show the first inequality since the 
function ce x is concave the cost per player ce x x is a 
nonincreasing function therefore inequality in the proof 
of theorem holds summing inequality over all 
players we obtain cost s i ci s ≤ φ s 
 γn −φ s

 the second inequality follows since ce x is 
nondecreasing and therefore ne 
x ce x x ≤ h ne · ce ne 
using the arguments in the proof of theorem and 
the proof of theorem we derive 
theorem the k-spoa of a fair connection game 
with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions and n players 
is at most n

· h k 
since the set of strong equilibria is contained in the set of 
nash equilibria it must hold that spoa ≤ poa meaning 
that the spoa can only be improved compared to the poa 
however with respect to the price of stability the opposite 
direction holds that is spos ≥ pos we next show that 
there exists a fair connection game in which the inequality

 general connection games 
in this section we derive our results for general connection 
games 
 existence of strong equilibrium 
we begin with a characterization of the existence of a 
strong equilibrium in symmetric general connection games 
similar to theorem using a similar proof we establish 
theorem in every symmetric fair connection game 
there exists a strong equilibrium 
while every single source general connection game 
possesses a pure nash equilibrium it does not necessarily 
admit some strong equilibrium 
 
this is a variation on the example given in 
 
we thank elliot anshelevich whose similar topology for 
the fair-connection game inspired this example 
theorem there exists a single source general 
connection game that does not admit any strong equilibrium 
proof consider single source general connection game 
with players on the graph depicted in figure player i 
wishes to connect the source s with its sink ti we need to 
consider only the ne profiles i if all three players use the 
link of cost then there must be two agents whose total 
sum exceeds thus they can both reduce cost by deviating 
to an edge of cost − ii if two of the players use an edge 
of cost − jointly and the third player uses a different edge 
of cost − then the players with non-zero payments can 
deviate to the path with the edge of cost and reduce their 
costs since before the deviation the total payments of the 
players is − we showed that none of the ne are se 
and thus the game does not possess any se 
next we show that for the class of series parallel graphs 
there is always a strong equilibrium in the case of a single 
source 
theorem in every single source general connection 
game on a series-parallel graph there exists a strong 
equilibrium 
proof let λ be a single source general connection game 
on a spg g v e with source s and sink t we present an 
algorithm that constructs a specific se we first consider the 
following partial order between the players for players i and 
j we have that i → j if there is a directed path from ti to tj 
we complete the partial order to a full order in an arbitrary 
way and w l o g we assume that → → · · · → n 
the algorithm compute-se considers the players in 
an increasing order starting with player each player i 
will fully buy a subset of the edges and any player j i 
will consider the cost of those bought edges as zero when 
compute-se considers player j the cost of the edges 
that players to j− have bought is set to zero and player j 
fully buys a shortest path qj 
from s to tj namely for every 
edges e ∈ qj 
\ ∪i jqi 
we have pj e ce and otherwise 
pj e we next show that the algorithm 
computese computes a se 
assume by way of contradiction that the profile p is not a 
se then there exists a coalition that can improve the costs 
of all its players by a deviation let γ be such a coalition 
of minimal size and let player i max j ∈ γ for a player 
j ∈ γ let ¯qj 
and ¯pj 
be the path and payment of player 
j after the deviation respectively let q be a path from 
the sink of player i i e ti to the sink of g i e t then 
q ¯qi 
∪ q is a path from the source s to the sink t for 
any player j i let yj be the intersecting vertex of q and 
tj by lemma one is guarantee to exist let y be the 
furthest vertex on the path q such that y yj for some 
j i the path from the source s to node y was fully paid 
for by players j i in p before the deviation there are 
two cases we consider 
case a after the deviation player i does not pay for edges 
in j∈γ\ i 
¯qj 
 this is a contradiction to the minimality of 
the coalition γ size since the players in γ \ i can form a 
smaller coalition with payments ¯p 
case b otherwise we show that player i cost after the 
deviation i e ci ¯p is at least his cost before the deviation i e 
ci p contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost 
recall that given two vertices u v on path ¯q we denote by 
¯qu v the subpath of ¯q from u to v 
 
before the deviation of the coalition γ a path from s to 
y was fully paid for by the players j i next we show that 
no player k i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti 
consider a player k i and let qk qk 
∪ qk where qk is 
a path connecting tk to t let yk be the intersecting vertex 
of qk and ti since there exists a path from s to yk that was 
fully paid for by players j k before the deviation in 
particularly the path qi 
s yk 
 player k will not pay for any edge 
on any path connecting s and yk therefore player i fully 
pays for all edges on the path ¯qi 
y ti 
 i e ¯pi e ce for all 
edges e ∈ ¯qi 
y ti 
 now consider the algorithm 
computese at the step when player i selects a shortest path from 
the source s to its sink ti and determines his payment pi at 
this point player i could buy the path ¯qi 
y ti 
 since a path 
from s to y was already paid for by players j i hence 
ci ¯p ≥ ci p this contradicts the fact that player i 
improved its cost and therefore not all the players in γ reduce 
their cost this implies that p is a strong equilibrium 
 strong price of anarchy 
while for every single source general connection game it 
holds that pos the price of anarchy can be as large 
as n even for two parallel edges here we show that any 
strong equilibrium in single source general connection games 
yields the optimal cost 
theorem in single source general connection game 
if there exists a strong equilibrium then the strong price of 
anarchy is 
proof let p p pn be a strong equilibrium and 
let t 
be the minimum cost steiner tree on all players 
rooted at the single source s let t 
e be the subtree of 
t 
disconnected from s when edge e is removed let γ te 
be the set of players which have sinks in te for a set of 
edges e let c e e∈e ce let p te i∈γ te ci p 
assume by way of contradiction that c p c t 
 we 
will show that there exists a sub-tree t of t 
 that connects 
a subset of players γ ⊆ n and a new set of payments ¯p such 
that for each i ∈ γ ci ¯p ci p this will contradict the 
assumption that p is a strong equilibrium 
first we show how to find a sub-tree t of t 
 such that 
for any edge e the payments of players with sinks in t 
e is 
more than the cost of t 
e ∪ e to build t define an edge 
e to be bad if the cost of t 
e ∪ e is at least the payments 
of the players with sinks in t 
e i e c t 
e ∪ e ≥ p t 
e 
let b be the set of bad edges we define t to be t 
− 
∪e∈b t 
e ∪ e note that we can find a subset b of b 
such that ∪e∈b t 
e ∪ e is equal to ∪e∈b t 
e ∪ e and 
for any e e ∈ b we have t 
e 
∩ t 
e 
 ∅ the set b will 
include any edge e ∈ b for which there is no other edge 
e ∈ b on the path from e to the source s considering 
the edges in e ∈ b we can see that any subtree t 
e we 
delete from t can not decrease the difference between the 
payments and the cost of the remaining tree therefore in 
t for every edge e we have that c te ∪ e p te 
now we have a tree t and our coalition will be γ t 
what remain is to find payments ¯p for the players in γ t 
such that they will buy the tree t and every player in γ t 
will lower its cost i e ci p ci ¯p for i ∈ γ t recall 
that the payments have the restriction that player i can only 
pay for edges on the path from s to ti 
we will now define the coalition payments ¯p let ci ¯p 
te e∈te 
¯pi e be the payments of player i for the 
subtree te we will show that for every subtree te ci ¯p te ∪ 
 e ci p and hence ci ¯p ci p consider the 
following bottom up process that defines ¯p we assign the 
payments of edge e in t after we assign payments to all 
the edges in te this implies that when we assign payments 
for e we have that the sum of the payments in te is equal to 
c te i∈γ te ci ¯p te since e was not a bad edge we 
know that c te ∪ e c te ce p te therefore we 
can update the payments ¯p of players i ∈ γ te by setting 
¯pi e ce∆i j∈γ te ∆j where ∆j cj p − cj ¯p te 
after the update we have for player i ∈ γ te 
ci ¯p te ∪ e ci ¯p te ¯pi e 
 ci ¯p te ∆i 
ce 
j∈γ te ∆j 
 ci p − ∆i − 
ce 
p γ te − c te 
 
where we used the fact that j∈γ te ∆j p γ te −c te 
since ce p γ te − c te it follows that ci ¯p te ∪ e 
ci p
