agents that must reach agreements with other agents need to 
reason about how their preferences judgments and beliefs might be 
aggregated with those of others by the social choice mechanisms 
that govern their interactions the recently emerging field of 
judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective 
and considers how multiple sets of logical formulae can be 
aggregated to a single consistent set as a special case judgment 
aggregation can be seen to subsume classical preference 
aggregation we present a modal logic that is intended to support reasoning 
about judgment aggregation scenarios and hence as a special case 
about preference aggregation the logical language is interpreted 
directly in judgment aggregation rules we present a sound and 
complete axiomatisation of such rules we show that the logic can 
express aggregation rules such as majority voting rule properties 
such as independence and results such as the discursive paradox 
arrow s theorem and condorcet s paradox - which are derivable

 introduction 
in this paper we are interested in knowledge representation 
formalisms for systems in which agents need to aggregate their 
preferences judgments beliefs etc for example an agent may need 
to reason about majority voting in a group he is a member of 
preference aggregation - combining individuals preference relations 
over some set of alternatives into a preference relation which 
represents the joint preferences of the group by so-called social 
welfare functions - has been extensively studied in social choice theory 
 the recently emerging field of judgment aggregation studies 
aggregation from a logical perspective and discusses how given 
a consistent set of logical formulae for each agent representing 
the agent s beliefs or judgments we can aggregate these to a 
single consistent set of formulae a variety of judgment aggregation 
rules have been developed to this end as a special case judgment 
aggregation can be seen to subsume preference aggregation 
in this paper we present a logic called judgment aggregation 
logic jal for reasoning about judgment aggregation the 
formulae of the logic are interpreted as statements about judgment 
aggregation rules and we give a sound and complete axiomatisation of 
all such rules the axiomatisation is parameterised in such a way 
that we can instantiate it to get a range of different judgment 
aggregation logics for example one instance is an axiomatisation in 
our language of all social welfare functions - thus we get a logic 
of classical preference aggregation as well and this is one of the 
main contributions of this paper we identify the logical properties 
of judgment aggregation and we can compare the logical 
properties of different classes of judgment aggregation - and of general 
judgment aggregation and preference aggregation in particular 
of course a logic is only interesting as long as it is 
expressive one of the goals of this paper is to investigate the 
representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and 
preference aggregation that is what kind of logical language might 
be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation an 
agent s knowledge representation language should be able to 
express common aggregation rules such as majority voting 
commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and 
social welfare functions such as independence paradoxes commonly 
used to illustrate judgment aggregation and preference aggregation 
viz the discursive paradox and condorcet s paradox respectively 
and other important properties such as arrow s theorem in order 
to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be 
able to express take the example of a potential property of social 
welfare functions swfs called independence of irrelevant 
alternatives iia given two preference profiles each consisting of one 
preference relation for each agent and two alternatives if for each 
agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference 
profiles then the two alternatives must have the same order in the 
two preference relations resulting from applying the swf to the 
two preference profiles respectively from this example it seems 
that a formal language for swfs should be able to express 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
 quantification on several levels over alternatives over 
preference profiles i e over relations over alternatives 
 secondorder quantification and over agents 
 properties of preference relations for different agents and 
properties of several different preference relations for the same 
agent in the same formula 
 comparison of different preference relations 
 the preference relation resulting from applying a swf to 
other preference relations 
from these points it might seem that such a language would be 
rather complex in particular these requirements seem to rule out a 
standard propositional modal logic perhaps surprisingly the 
language of jal is syntactically and semantically rather simple and yet 
the language is nevertheless expressive enough to give elegant and 
succinct expressions of e g iia majority voting the discursive 
dilemma condorcet s paradox and arrow s theorem this means 
for example that arrow s theorem is a formal theorem of jal i e 
a derivable formula we thus have a formal proof theory for social 
choice 
the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows in the next 
section we review the basics of judgment aggregation as well as 
preference aggregation and mention some commonly discussed 
properties of judgment aggregation rules and social welfare 
functions in section we introduce the syntax and semantics of jal 
and study the complexity of the model checking problem 
formulae of jal are interpreted directly by and thus represent properties 
of judgment aggregation rules in section we demonstrate that 
the logic can express commonly discussed properties of judgment 
aggregation rules such as the discursive paradox we give a sound 
and complete axiomatisation of the logic in section under the 
assumption that the agenda the agents make judgments over is finite 
as mentioned above preference aggregation can be seen as a 
special case of judgment aggregation and in section we introduce an 
alternative interpretation of jal formulae directly in social welfare 
functions we obtain a sound and complete axiomatisation of the 
logic for preference aggregation as well sections and discusses 
related work and concludes 
 judgment and preference 
aggregation 
judgment aggregation is concerned with judgment aggregation 
rules aggregating sets of logical formulae preference aggregation 
is concerned with social welfare functions aggregating preferences 
over some set of alternatives let n be a number of agents we write 
σ for the set n 
 judgment aggregation rules 
let l be a logic with language l l we require that the 
language has negation and material implication with the usual 
semantics we will sometimes refer to l as the underlying logic an 
agenda over l is a non-empty set a ⊆ l l where for every 
formula φ that does not start with a negation φ ∈ a iff ¬φ ∈ a we 
sometimes call a member of a an agenda item a subset a ⊆ a is 
consistent unless a entails both ¬φ and φ in l for some φ ∈ l l 
a is complete if either φ ∈ a or ¬φ ∈ a for every φ ∈ a which 
does not start with negation an admissible individual judgment 
set is a complete and consistent subset ai ⊆ a of the agenda the 
idea here is that a judgment set ai represents the choices from a 
made by agent i two rationality criteria demand that an agents 
choices at least be internally consistent and that each agent makes 
a decision between every item and its negation an admissible 
judgment profile is an n-tuple a an where ai is the 
individual judgment set of agent i j a l denotes the set of all individual 
 complete and l-consistent judgment sets over a and j a l n 
the set of all judgment profiles over a when γ ∈ j a l n 
 we use 
γi to denote the ith element of γ i e agent i s individual judgment 
set in judgment profile γ 
a judgment aggregation rule jar is a function f that maps each 
judgment profile a an to a complete and consistent 
collective judgment set f a an ∈ j a l such a rule hence is a 
recipe to enforce a rational group decision given an tuple of 
rational choices by the individual agents of course such a rule should 
to a certain extent be  fair some possible properties of a judgment 
aggregation rule f over an agenda a 
non-dictatorship nd there is no agent i such that for every 
judgment profile a an f a an ai 
independence ind for any p ∈ a and judgment profiles 
a an and b bn if for all agents i p ∈ ai iff 
p ∈ bi then p ∈ f a an iff p ∈ f b bn 
unanimity una for any judgment profile a an and any 
p ∈ a if p ∈ ai for all agents i then p ∈ f a an 
 social welfare functions 
social welfare functions swfs are usually defined in terms of 
ordinal preference structures rather than cardinal structures such as 
utility functions an swf takes a preference relation a binary 
relation over some set of alternatives for each agent and outputs 
another preference relation representing the aggregated preferences 
the most well known result about swfs is arrow s theorem 
many variants of the theorem appear in the literature differing in 
assumptions about the preference relations in this paper we take 
the assumption that all preference relations are linear orders i e 
that neither agents nor the aggregated preference can be indifferent 
between distinct alternatives this gives one of the simplest 
formulations of arrow s theorem theorem below cf e g for a 
discussion and more general formulations 
formally let k be a set of alternatives we henceforth 
implicitly assume that there are always at least two alternatives a 
preference relation over k is here a total linear order on k i e 
a relation r over k which is antisymmetric i e a b ∈ r and 
 b a ∈ r implies that a b transitive i e a b ∈ r and 
 b c ∈ r implies that a c ∈ r and total i e either a b ∈ 
r or b a ∈ r we sometimes use the infix notation arb for 
 a b ∈ r the set of preference relations over alternatives k is 
denoted l k alternatively we can view l k as the set of all 
permutations of k thus we shall sometimes use a permutation of 
k to denote a member of l k for example when k a b c 
we will sometimes use the expression acb to denote the relation 
 a c a b c b a a b b c c arb means that b is 
preferred over a if a and b are different rs 
denotes the irreflexive 
version of r i e rs 
 r \ a a a ∈ k ars 
b means that b is 
preferred over a and that a b 
a preference profile for σ over alternatives k is a tuple 
 r rn ∈ l k n 
 consisting of one preference relation ri for 
each agent i a social welfare function swf is a function 
f l k n 
→ l k 
mapping each preference profile to an aggregated preference 
relation the class of all swfs over alternatives k is denoted f k

 judgment aggregation logic 
syntax and semantics 
the language of judgment aggregation logic jal is 
parameterised by a set of agents σ n we will assume that 
there are at least two agents and an agenda a the following 
atomic propositions are used 
π i σ hp p ∈ a i ∈ σ 
the language l σ a of jal is defined by the following grammar 
φ α φ φ φ ∧ φ ¬φ 
where α ∈ π this language will be formally interpreted in 
structures consisting of an agenda item a judgment profile and a 
judgment aggregation function informally i means that the agenda item 
is in agent i s judgment set in the current judgment profile σ means 
that the agenda item is in the aggregated judgment set of the current 
judgment profile hp means that the agenda item is p φ means that 
φ is true in every judgment profile φ means that φ is true in every 
agenda item 
we define ψ ¬ ¬ψ intuitively meaning ψ is true for some 
judgment profile and ψ ¬ ¬ψ intuitively meaning ψ is true 
for some agenda item as usual in addition to the usual derived 
propositional connectives 
we now define the formal semantics of l σ a a model wrt 
l σ a and underlying logic l is a judgment aggregation rule f 
over a recall that j a l n 
denotes the set of complete and 
lconsistent judgment profiles over a a table is a tuple t f γ p 
such that f is a model γ ∈ j a l n 
and p ∈ a a formula is 
interpreted on a table as follows 
f γ p l hq ⇔ p q 
f γ p l i ⇔ p ∈ γi 
f γ p l σ ⇔ p ∈ f γ 
f γ p l ψ ⇔ ∀γ ∈ j a l n 
f γ p l ψ 
f γ p l ψ ⇔ ∀p ∈ a f γ p l ψ 
f γ p l φ ∧ ψ ⇔ f γ p l φ and f γ p l ψ 
f γ p l ¬φ ⇔ f γ p l φ 
so e g we have that f γ p l i∈σ i if everybody chooses p in γ 
example a committee of three agents are voting on the 
following three propositions the candidate is qualified p if the 
candidate is qualified he will get an offer p → q and the 
candidate will get an offer q one possible voting scenario 
is illustrated in the left part of table in the table the results 
of proposition-wise majority voting i e the jar fmaj accepting a 
proposition iff it is accepted by a majority of the agents are also 
p p → q q 
 yes yes yes 
 no yes yes 
 yes no no 
fmaj yes yes yes

table examples 
shown this example can be modelled by taking the agenda to 
be a p p → q q ¬p ¬ p → q ¬q recall that agendas are 
closed under single negation and l to be propositional logic the 
agents votes can be modelled by the following judgment profile 
γ γ γ γ where γ p p → q q γ ¬p p → q q 
γ p ¬ p → q ¬q we then have that 
 fmaj γ p l ∧ ¬ ∧ agents and judges p to be true in 
the profile γ while agent does not 
 fmaj γ p l σ majority voting on p given the preference 
profile γ leads to acceptance of p 
 fmaj γ p l ∧ agents and agree on some agenda 
item under the judgment profile γ note that this formula 
does not depend on which agenda item is on the table 
 fmaj γ p l ↔ ∧ ↔ ∧ ↔ there is some 
judgment profile on which all agents agree on p note that 
this formula does not depend on which judgment profile is on 
the table 
 fmaj γ p l ↔ ∧ ↔ ∧ ↔ there 
is some judgment profile on which all agents agree on all 
agenda items note that this formula does not depend on any 
of the elements on the table 
 fmaj γ p l σ ↔ g⊆ g ≥ i∈g i the jar fmaj 
implements majority voting 
we write f l φ iff f γ p l φ for every γ over a and p ∈ a 
 l φ iff f l φ for all models f given a possible property of a 
jar such as e g independence we say that a formula expresses 
the property if the formula is true in an aggregation rule f iff f has 
the property 
note that when we are given a formula φ ∈ l σ a validity 
i e l φ is defined with respect to models of the particular 
language l σ a defined over the particular agenda a and similar 
for validity with respect to a jar i e f l φ the agenda like 
the set of agents σ is given when we define the language and is 
thus implicit in the interpretation of the language 
 
let an outcome o be a maximal conjunction of literals 
 ¬ ¬ n the set o is the set of all possible outcomes note 
that the decision of the society is not incorporated here an outcome 
only collects votes of agents from σ 
 model checking 
model checking is currently one of the most active areas of 
research with respect to reasoning in modal logics and it is natural 
to investigate the complexity of this problem for judgment 
aggregation logic intuitively the model checking problem for judgment 
aggregation logic is as follows 
given f γ p and formula φ of jal is it the case that 
f γ p φ or not 
 
likewise in classical modal logic the language is parameterised 
with a set of primitive propositions and validity is defined with 
respect to all models with valuations over that particular set 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
while this problem is easy to understand mathematically it presents 
some difficulties if we want to analyse it from a computational 
point of view specifically the problem lies in the 
representation of the judgment aggregation rule f recall that this 
function maps judgment profiles to complete and consistent judgment 
sets a jar must be defined for all judgment profiles over some 
agenda i e it must produce an output for all these possible 
inputs but how are we to represent such a rule the simplest 
representation of a function f x → y is as the set of ordered pairs 
 x y x ∈ x y f x however this is not a feasible 
representation for jars as there will be exponentially many judgment 
profiles in the size of the agenda and so the representation would 
be unfeasibly large in practice if we did assume this 
representation for jars then it is not hard to see that model checking for our 
logic would be decidable in polynomial time the naive algorithm 
derivable from semantics serves this purpose 
however we emphasise that this result is of no practical 
significance since it assumes an unreasonable representation for models 
- a representation that simply could not be used in practice for 
examples of anything other than trivial size 
so what is a more realistic representation for jars let us say 
a representation rf of a jar f is reasonable if i the size of rf 
is polynomial in the size of the agenda and ii there is a 
polynomial time algorithm a which takes as input a representation rf 
and a judgment profile γ and produces as output f γ there are 
of course many such representations rf for jars f here we will 
look at one very general one where the jar is represented as a 
polynomially bounded two-tape turing machine tf which takes 
on its first tape a judgment profile and writes on its second tape 
the resulting judgment set the requirement that the turing 
machine should be polynomially bounded roughly corresponds to the 
requirement that a jar is reasonable to compute if there is some 
jar that cannot be represented by such a machine then it is 
arguably of little value since it could not be used in practice 
 with 
such a representation we can investigate the complexity of our 
model checking problem 
in modal logics the usual source of complexity over and above 
the classical logic connectives is the modal operators with 
respect to judgment aggregation logic the operator quantifies over 
all judgment profiles and hence over all consistent subsets of the 
agenda it follows that this is a rather powerful operator as we will 
see it can be used as an np oracle p in contrast the 
operator quantifies over members of the agenda and is hence much 
weaker from a computational perspective we can think of it as a 
conjunction over elements of the agenda 
the power of the quantifier suggests that the complexity of 
model checking judgment aggregation logic over relatively 
succinct representations of jar is going to be relatively high we now 
prove that the complexity of model checking judgment aggregation 
logic is as hard as solving a polynomial number of np-hard 
problems pp - 
theorem the model checking problem for judgment 
aggregation logic assuming the representation of jars described above 
is δp 
 -hard it is np-hard even if the formula to be checked is of the 
form ψ where ψ contains no further or operators 
proof for δp 
 -hardness we reduce snsat sequentially nested 
 
of course we have no general way of checking whether any 
given turing machine is guaranteed to terminate in polynomial 
time the problem is undecidable as a consequence we cannot 
always check whether a particular turing machine representation 
of a jar meets our requirements however this does not prevent 
specific jars being so represented with corresponding proofs that 
they terminate in polynomial time 
satisfiability an instance is given by a series of equations of the 
form 
z ∃x φ x z ∃x φ x z z ∃x φ x z z 
 
zk ∃xk φk xk z zk− 
where x xk are disjoint sets of variables and each φi y is a 
propositional logic formula over the variables y the idea is we first 
check whether φ x is satisfiable and if it is we assign z the 
value true otherwise assign it false we then check whether φ is 
satisfiable under the assumption that z takes the value just derived 
and so on thus the result of each equation depends on the value of 
the previous one the goal is to determine whether zk is true 
to reduce this problem to judgment aggregation logic model 
checking we first fix the jar this rule simply copies whatever 
agent s judgment set is clearly this can be implemented by a 
polynomially bounded turing machine the agenda is assumed to 
contain the variables x ∪ · · · ∪ xk ∪ z zk and their negations 
we fix the initial judgment profile γ to be x ∪· · ·∪xk ∪ z zk 
and fix p x given a variable xi define x 
i to be hxi ∧ if φi is 
one of the formulae φ φk define φ 
i to be the formula obtained 
from φi by systematically substituting x 
i for each variable xi and z 
i 
similarly 
now we define the function ξi for natural numbers i as 
ξk 
z 
 ↔ φ 
 if i 
z 
i ↔ φ 
i ∧i− 
j ξj otherwise 
and we define the formula to be model checked as 
φ 
k ∧k− 
j ξj 
it is now straightforward from construction that this formula is true 
under the interpretation iff zk is true in the snsat instance the proof 
of the latter half of the theorem is immediate from the special case 
where k 
 some properties 
we have thus defined a language which can be used to express 
properties of judgment aggregation rules an interesting question 
is then what are the universal properties of aggregation rules 
expressible in the language which formulae are valid here in order 
to illustrate the logic we discuss some of these logical properties 
in section we give a complete axiomatisation of all of them 
recall that we defined the set o of outcomes as the set of all 
conjunctions with exactly one possibly negated atom from σ let 
p o ∧ σ o ∧ ¬σ o ∈ o p ∈ p completely describes the 
decisions of the agents and the aggregation function let denote 
exclusive or 
we have that 
 l p∈pp - any agent and the jar always have to make a decision 
 l i ∧ ¬j → ¬i - if some agent can think differently about an 
item than i does then also i can change his mind about it in 
fact this principle can be strengthened to 
 l i ∧ ¬j → ¬i ∧ j 
 l x - for any x ∈ i ¬i σ ¬σ i ∈ σ - both the individual 
agents and the jar will always judge some agenda item to 
be true and conversely some agenda item to be false 
 l i ∧ j - there exist admissible judgment sets such that agents 
i and j agree on some judgment 
 l i ↔ j - there exist admissible judgment sets such that agents 
i and j always agree 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the interpretation of formulae depends on the agenda a and the 
underlying logic l in the quantification over the set j a l n 
of 
admissible e g complete and l-consistent judgment profiles note 
that this means that some jal formula might be valid under one 
underlying logic while not under another for example if the agenda 
contains some formula which is inconsistent in the underlying logic 
 and by implication some tautology then the following hold 
 l i ∧ σ - for every judgment profile there is some agenda 
item take a tautology which both agent i and the jar judges 
to be true 
but this property does not hold when every agenda item is 
consistent with respect to the underlying logic one such agenda and 
underlying logic will be discussed in section

unanimity can be expressed as follows

 the discursive paradox 
as illustrated in example the following formula expresses 
proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p

i 
i e the following property of a jar f and admissible profile 
a an 
p ∈ f a an ⇔ i p ∈ ai i p ai 
f mv exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment 
profiles and propositions 
however we have the following in our logic assume that the 
agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material 
implication i e a contains p q p → q for some p q ∈ l l 
proposition discursive paradox 
 l mv → ⊥ 
when there are at least three agents and the agenda contains at 
least two distinct formulae and their material implication 
proof assume the opposite e g that a p p → q q ¬p 
¬ p → q ¬q and there exists an aggregation rule f over a 
such that f l σ ↔ g⊆σ g n 
 i∈g i let γ be the 
judgment profile γ a a a where a p p → q q a 
 p ¬ p → q ¬q and a ¬p p → q ¬q we have 
that f γ p l σ ↔ g⊆σ g n 
 i∈g i for any p so f γ p l 
σ ↔ g⊆σ g n 
 i∈g i because f γ p l ∧ it follows that 
f γ p l σ in a similar manner it follows that f γ p → q l σ 
and f γ q l ¬σ in other words p ∈ f γ p → q ∈ f γ and 
q f γ since f γ is complete ¬q ∈ f γ but that contradicts 
the fact that f γ is required to be consistent 
proposition is a logical statement of a variant of the well-known 
discursive dilemma if three agents are voting on propositions p q 
and p → q proposition-wise majority voting might not yield a 
consistent result

the first axioms represent properties of a table and of judgment 
sets axiom atmost says that there is at most one item on the table 
at a time and atleast says that we always have an item on the table 
axiom agenda says that every agenda item will appear on the table 
whereas once says that every item of the agenda only appears on 
the table once note that a conjunction hp ∧ x reads item p is on 
the agenda and x is in favour of it or x judges it true axiom cpjs 
corresponds to the requirement that judgment sets are complete 
note that from agenda csjs and cpjs we derive the scheme x ∧ 
¬x which says that everybody should at least express one opinion 
in favour of something and against something 
the axioms taut − are well familiar from modal logic they 
directly reflect the unrestricted quantification in the truth definition 
of and axiom c says that for any agenda item for which it 
is possible to have opposing opinions every possible outcome for 
that item should be achievable comm says that everything that 
is true for an arbitrary profile and item is also true for an arbitrary 
item and profile closure guarantees that agents behave 
consistently with respect to consequence in the logic l mp and nec are 
standard we use jal l to denote derivability in jal l 
theorem if the agenda is finite we have that for any formula 
ψ ∈ l σ a jal l ψ iff l ψ 
proof soundness is straightforward for completeness we 
focus on the main idea here and leave out trivial details we build a 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
jal table for a consistent formula ψ as follows in fact our 
axiomatisation completely determines a table except for the behaviour of 
f to be more precise let a table description be a conjunction of 
the form hp ∧ o ∧ ¬ σ it is easy to see that table descriptions are 
mutually exclusive and moreover we can derive τ∈t τ where t 
is the set of all table descriptions let d be the set of all 
maximal consistent sets δ we don t want all of those it might well 
be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way which is incompatible 
with some δ s we define two accessibility relations in the standard 
way r δ δ iff for all ψ ψ ∈ δ ⇒ ψ ∈ δ similarly for r 
with respect to both relations are equivalences due to taut- 
and moreover when r δ δ and r δ δ then for some δ also 
r δ δ and r δ δ because of axiom comm 
let δ be a mcs containing ψ we now define the set tables 
 δ ∪ δ δ r δ δ and r δ δ or r δ δ and r δ δ 
every δ ∈ tables can be conceived as a pair γ p since every δ 
contains a unique hq ∧ o ∧ ¬ σ for every hq and a unique hp 
it is then easy to verify that for every δ ∈ tables and every 
formula ϕ δ ϕ iff ϕ ∈ δ where here means truth in the 
ordinary modal logic sense when the set of states is taken to be 
tables now we extract an aggregation function f and pairs γ p as 
follows 
for every δ ∈ tables find a conjunction hp ∧ o ∧ ¬ σ there 
will be exactly one such p this defines the p we are looking for 
furthermore the γ is obtained for every agent i by finding all q for 
which hq ∧ i is currently true finally the function f is a table 
of all tuples hp o p σ for which hp ∧ o o ∧ σ is contained in 
some set in tables 
we point out that jal has all the axioms taut k t and the 
rules mp and nec of the modal logic s however uniform 
substitution a principle of all normal modal logics cf e g does 
not hold a counter example is the fact that the following is valid 
σ 
- no matter what preferences the agents have the jar will always 
make some judgment - while this is not valid 
 σ ∧ i 
- the jar will not necessarily make the same judgments as agent i 
so for example we have that the discursive paradox is provable 
in jal l jal l mv → ⊥ an example of a derivation of 
the less complicated valid property i ∧ j is shown in table 
 preference aggregation 
recently dietrich and list showed that preference 
aggregation can be embedded in judgment aggregation in this section we 
show that our judgment aggregation logic also can be used to 
reason about preference aggregation 
given a set k of alternatives defines a simple predicate logic 
lk 
with language l lk 
 as follows 
 l lk 
 has one constant a for each alternative a ∈ k 
variables v v a binary identity predicate a binary 
predicate p for strict preference and the usual propositional and 
first order connectives 
 z is the collection of the following axioms 
- ∀v ∀v v pv → ¬v pv 
- ∀v ∀v ∀v v pv ∧ v pv → v pv 
- ∀v ∀v ¬v v → v pv ∨ v pv 
 when γ ⊆ l lk 
 and φ is a formula γ φ is defined to hold 
iff γ ∪ z entails φ in the standard sense of predicate logic

table jar derivation of i ∧ j 
it is easy to see that there is an one-to-one correspondence between 
the set of preference relations total linear orders over k and the set 
of lk 
-consistent and complete judgment sets over the preference 
agenda 
ak 
 apb ¬apb a b ∈ k a b 
given a swf f over k the corresponding jar ff 
over the 
preference agenda ak 
is defined as follows ff 
 a an a where 
a is the consistent and complete judgment set corresponding to 
f l ln where li is the preference relation corresponding to 
the consistent and complete judgment set ai 
thus we can use jal to reason about preference aggregation as 
follows take the logical language l σ ak 
 for some set of agents 
σ and take the underlying logic to be lk 
 we can then interpret our 
formulae in an swf f over k a preference profile l ∈ l k and a 
pair a b ⊆ k × k a b as follows 
f l a b swf 
φ ⇔ ff 
 γl 
 apb lk φ 
where γl 
is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference 
profile l 
while in the general judgment aggregation case a formula is 
interpreted in the context of an agenda item in the preference 
aggregation case a formula is thus interpreted in the context of a pair of 
alternatives 
example three agents must decide between going to dinner 
 d a movie m or a concert c their individual preferences 
are illustrated on the right in table in section along with the 
result of a swf fmaj implementing pair-wise majority voting let 
l mdc mcd cmd be the preference profile corresponding to the 
preferences in the example we have the following 
 fmaj l m d swf 
 ∧ ∧ all agents agree under the 
individual rankings l on the relative ranking of m and 
dthey agree that d is better than m 
 fmaj l m d swf 
¬ ↔ under the individual 
rankings l there is some pair of alternatives on which agents 
and disagree 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 fmaj l m d swf 
 ∧ agents and can choose 
their preferences such that they will agree on some pair of 
alternatives 
 fmaj l m d swf 
σ ↔ g⊆ g ≥ i∈g i the swf fmaj 
implements pair-wise majority voting 
as usual we write f swf 
φ when f l a b swf 
φ for any l 
and a b and so on thus our formulae can be seen as expressing 
properties of social welfare functions 
example take the formula i ↔ σ when this formula is 
interpreted as a statement about a social welfare function it says 
that there exists a preference profile such that for all pairs a b of 
alternatives b is preferred over a in the aggregation by the swf 
of the preference profile if and only if agent i prefers b over a 
 expressivity examples 
we make precise the claim in section that the three 
mentioned swf properties correspond to the three mentioned jar 
properties respectively recall the formulae defined in section 
proposition 
f swf 
nd iff f has the property nd 
f swf 
ind iff f has the property iia 
f swf 
una iff f has the property po 
the properties expressed above are properties of swfs let us 
now look at properties of the set of alternatives k we can express 
properties involving cardinality is often of interest for example in 
arrow s theorem let 
mt ∧ ∧ ∧ ¬ 
proposition let f ∈ f k k iff f swf 
mt 
proof for the direction to the left let f swf 
mt thus there 
is a γ such that there exists a 
 b 
 a 
 b 
 ∈ k × k where a 
b 
 and a 
b 
 such that i a 
pb 
∈ γ ii a 
pb 
∈ γ iii 
a 
pb 
∈ γ and iv a 
pb 
γ from ii and iv we get that 
 a 
 b 
 a 
 b 
 and from that and i and iii it follows that 
γ contains two different pairs a 
pb 
and a 
pb 
each having two 
different elements but that is not possible if k because if k 
 a b then ak 
 apb ¬apb bpa ¬bpa and thus it is impossible 
that γ ⊆ ak 
since we cannot have apb bpa ∈ γ 
for the direction to the right let k let a b c be three 
distinct elements of k let γ be the judgment set corresponding 
to the ranking abc and γ the judgment set corresponding to acb 
now for any aggregation rule f f γ apb ∧ and f γ bpc 
 ∧ ¬ thus f swf 
mt for any swf f 
we now have everything we need to express arrow s statement 
as a formula it follows from his theorem that the formula is valid 
on the class of all social welfare functions 
theorem swf 
mt → ¬ po ∧ nd ∧ iia 
proof note that mt po nd and iia are true swf properties 
their truth value wrt a table is determined solely by the swf for 
example f l a b swf 
mt iff f mt for any f l a b 
let f ∈ f k and f l a b swf 
mt for some l and a b by 
proposition k has more than two alternatives by arrow s 
theorem f cannot have all the properties po nd and iia w l o g 
assume that f does not have the po property by proposition 
f swf 
po since po is a swf property this means that 
f l a b swf 
po satisfaction of po is independent of l a b 
and thus that f l a b swf 
¬po ∨ ¬nd ∨ ¬iia 
note that the formula in theorem does not mention any agenda 
items i e pairs of alternatives such as hapb directly in an 
expression this means that the formula is a member of l σ ak 
 for any 
set of alternatives k and is valid no matter which set of alternatives 
we assume 
the formula mv which in the general judgment aggregation case 
expresses proposition-wise majority voting expresses in the 
preference aggregation case pair-wise majority voting as illustrated in 
example the preference aggregation correspondent to the 
discursive paradox of judgment aggregation is the well known 
condorcet s voting paradox stating that pair-wise majority voting can 
lead to aggregated preferences which are cyclic even if the 
individual preferences are not we can express condorcet s paradox 
as follows again as a universally valid logical property of swfs 
proposition swf 
mt → ¬mv when there are at least 
three agents 
proof the proof is similar to the proof of the discursive 
paradox let ff 
 γ apb lk mt there are thus three distinct 
elements a b c ∈ k assume that ff 
 γ apb lk mv let 
γ be the judgment profile corresponding to the preference 
profile x abc cab bca we have that ff 
 γ apb lk ∧ and 
since ff 
 γ apb lk mv we have that ff 
 γ apb lk σ and thus 
that apb ∈ ff 
 γ and a b ∈ f x in a similar manner we get 
that c a ∈ f x and b c ∈ f x but that is impossible since 
by transitivity we would also have that a c ∈ f x which 
contradicts the fact that f x is antisymmetric thus it follows that 
ff 
 γ apb lk mv 
 axiomatisation and logical properties 
we immediately get from theorem a sound and complete 
axiomatisation of preference aggregation over a finite set of 
alternatives 
corollary if the set of alternatives k is finite we have that 
for any formula ψ ∈ l σ ak 
 jal lk ψ iff swf 
ψ 
proof follows immediately from theorem and the fact that 
for any jar f there is a swf f such that f ff 
 
so for example arrow s theorem is provable in jal lk 
 jal lk 
mt → ¬ po ∧ nd ∧ iia 
every formula which is valid with respect to judgment 
aggregation rules is also valid with respect to social welfare functions so 
all general logical properties of jars are also properties of swfs 
depending on the agenda swfs may have additional properties 
induced by the logic lk 
 which are not always shared by jars with 
other underlying logics one such property is i while we have 
 swf 
i 
for other agendas there are underlying logics l such that 
 l i 
to see the latter take an agenda with a formula p which is 
inconsistent in the underlying logic l - p can never be included in a 
judgment set to see the former take an arbitrary pair of 
alternatives a b there exists some preference profile in which agent i 
prefers b over a 
technically speaking the formula i holds in swfs because the 
agenda ak 
does not contain a formula which alone is inconsistent 
wrt the underlying logic lk 
 by the same reason the following 
properties also hold in swfs but not in jars in general 
 swf 
o∈o 
o 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
- for any pair of alternatives a b any possible combination of the 
relative ranking of a and b among the agents is possible 
 swf 
i → ¬i 
- given an alternative b which is preferred over some other 
alternative a by agent i there is some other pair of alternatives c and d 
such that d is not preferred over c - namely c d b a 
 swf 
 i ∨ j → i ∧ ¬j 
- if given preferences of agents and a swf for any two alternatives 
it is always the case that either agent i or agent j prefers the second 
alternative over the first then there must exist a pair of alternatives 
for which the two agents disagree a justification is that no single 
agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair 
of alternatives so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer 
a over b again this property does not necessarily hold for other 
agendas because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the 
agents could not possibly disagree upon 
proof theoretically these additional properties of swfs are 
derived using the closure rule 
 related work 
formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the 
logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is 
large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated 
preferences for a given representation 
a notable and recent exception is a logical framework for 
judgment aggregation developed by marc pauly in in order to be 
able to characterise the logical relationships between different 
judgment aggregation rules while the motivation is similar to the work 
in this paper the approaches are fundamentally different in 
the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment 
profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically in our 
approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs i e judgment 
profiles are taken as primary and described axiomatically the two 
approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the 
sense that one can be embedded in the other 
the modal logic arrow logic is designed to reason about any 
object that can be graphically represented as an arrow and has 
various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships 
between these arrows in the preference aggregation logic jal lk 
 
we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen 
as arrows thus at least the preference aggregation variant of our 
logic is related to arrow logic however while the modal operators 
of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such 
as transitivity they cannot directly express most of the properties 
we have discussed in this paper nevertheless the relationship to 
arrow logic could be investigated further in future work in 
particular arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt an algebra 
this could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as 
the underlying structure to represent individual and collective 
preferences then changing the preference profile takes us from one 
algebra to another and a swf determines the collective preference 
in each of the algebras 
 discussion 
we have presented a sound and complete logic jal for 
representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation jal is expressive 
it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting 
complicated properties such as independence and important results 
such as the discursive paradox arrow s theorem and condorcet s 
paradox we argue that these results show exactly which logical 
capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about 
judgment aggregation it is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple 
language provides these capabilities jal provides a proof theory in 
which results such as those mentioned above can be derived 
 
the axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment 
aggregation and can also be instantiated to reason about specific 
instances of judgment aggregation such as classical arrovian 
preference aggregation thus our framework sheds light on the 
differences between the logical principles behind general judgment 
aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation 
on the other 
in future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness 
and consistency requirements of judgment sets and try to 
characterise these in the logical language as properties of general 
judgment sets instead
