 introduction 
mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that 
studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable 
outcomes when the players are rational in a standard 
setting players hold some private information - their types 
- and choose actions from their action spaces to 
maximize their utilities the social planner wishes to implement 
a social-choice function which maps each possible state of 
the world i e a profile of the players types to a single 
alternative for example a government that wishes to 
undertake a public-good project e g building a bridge only 
if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost 
much of the literature on mechanism design restricts 
attention to direct revelation mechanisms in which a player s 
action space is identical to his type space this focus is 
owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some 
mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium the 
same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an 
equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type 
nonetheless in many environments direct-revelation 
mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the 
players have a limited expressive power consider for 
example the well-studied screening model where an 
insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different 
drivers based on their caution levels which is their private 
information in this model drivers may have a continuum of 
possible caution levels but insurance companies offer only 
a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or 
illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies 
there are various reasons for such strict restrictions on 
the action spaces in some situations firms are not willing 
or cannot run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for 
some product or service the buyers in such environemnts 
face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they 
may have an infinite number of possible values for the item 
in many similar settings players might be also reluctant to 
reveal their accurate types but willing to disclose partial 
information about them for example agents will typically be 
unwilling to reveal their types even if it is beneficial for them 
in the short run since it might harm them in future 
transactions agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep 
their valuations private or not even know their exact 
type while computing it may be expensive limitations 
on the action space can also be caused by technical 
constraints such as severe restrictions on the communication 
lines or from the the need to perform quick transactions 
 e g discrete bidding in english auctions 
 
consider for example a public-good model a social 
planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge the two 
players in the game have some privately known benefits 
θ θ ∈ from using this bridge the social planner 
aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits 
exceeds the construction cost of the bridge the social planner 
cannot access the private data of the players and can only 
learn about it from the players actions when direct 
revelation is allowed the social planner can run the well-known 
vcg mechanism where the players have incentives to 
report their true data hence the planner can elicit the exact 
private information of the players and build the bridge only 
when it should be built assume now that the players 
cannot send their entire secret data but can only choose an 
action out of two possible actions e g or now 
the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always 
build the bridge according to her objective function due to 
the limited expressivness of the players messages in this 
work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence 
of such restrictions 
restrictions on the action space for specific models were 
studied in several earlier papers the work of blumrosen 
nisan and segal is the closest in spirit to this paper 
they studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed 
to send messages with severely bounded size they 
characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction and 
showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with 
very strict limitations on the action space other work 
studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending 
auctions take-it-or-leave-it auctions or for 
measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers 
on the performance of electricity markets our work 
generalizes the main results of blumrosen et al to a 
general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a 
multitude of models we show that some main properties 
proved by blumrosen et al are preserved in more general 
frameworks for example that dominant-strategy 
equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost and that the 
loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a 
similar rate where some other properties do not always hold 
 for example that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and 
that players must always use all their action space 
a standard mechanism design setting is composed of 
agents with private information their types and a 
social planner who wishes to implement a social choice 
function c - a function that maps any profile of the agents 
types into a chosen alternative a classic result in this 
setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the 
agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption see 
definition below - a social-choice function is implementable 
in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the 
players types however in environments with restricted 
action spaces the social planner cannot typically implement 
every social-choice function due to inherent informational 
constraints that is for some realizations of the players 
types the decision of the social planner will be incompatible 
with the social-choice function c in order to quantitatively 
measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can 
approximate the original social-choice functions we follow a 
standard assumption that the social choice function is derived 
from a social-value function g which assigns a real value 
for every alternative a and realization of the players types 
the social-choice function c will therefore choose an 
alternative that maximizes the social value function given the type 
vector 
−→ 
θ θ θn i e c 
−→ 
θ argmaxa g 
−→ 
θ a 
observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the 
social welfare function - the social welfare function is a 
special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the 
players valuations for the chosen alternative following are 
several simple examples of social-value functions 
 public goods a government wishes to build a bridge 
only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from 
it exceeds its construction cost c the social value 
functions in a -player game will therefore be 
g θ θ build θ θ -c and 
g θ θ do not build 
 routing in networks consider a network that is 
composed of two links in parallel each link has a secret 
probability pi of transferring a message successfully 
a sender wishes to send his message through the 
network only if the probability of success is greater than 
say percent - the known probability in an alternate 
network that is 
g p p send in network - -p · -p and 
g p p send in alternate network 
 single-item auctions consider a -player auction 
where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the 
player who values it the most the social choice 
function is given by g θ θ player wins θ and for 
the second alternative is g θ θ player wins

 our contribution 
in this paper we present a general framework for the 
study of mechanism design in environments with a limited 
number of actions we assume a bayesian model where 
players have one-dimensional private types independently 
distributed on some real interval 
the main question we ask is when agents are only allowed 
to use k different actions which mechanisms achieve the 
optimal expected social-value note that this question is 
actually composed of two separate questions the first question 
is an information-theoretic question what is the optimal 
result achievable when the players can only reveal 
information using these k actions recall that their type space 
may be continuous the other question involves 
gametheoretic considerations what is the best result achievable 
with k actions where this result should be achieved in a 
dominant-strategy equilibrium these questions raise the 
question about the price of implementation can the 
optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in 
a dominant-strategy equilibrium and if not to what 
extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the 
optimal result what we call the price of implementation 
was also explored in other contexts in game theory where 
computational restrictions apply for example is it always 
true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio 
 for example in combinatorial auctions can be achieved in 
equilibrium the answer for this interesting problem is still 
unclear see e g 
our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient 
conditions for implementing the optimal 
informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies we show 
that for the family of multilinear social-value functions that 
 
is polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most 
one in each monomial the dominant-strategy 
implementation incurs no additional cost 
theorem given any multilinear single-crossing 
socialvalue function and for any number of alternatives and 
players the social choice rule that is information-theoretically 
optimal is implementable in dominant strategies 
multilinear social-value functions capture many 
important and well-studied models and include for instance the 
routing example given above and any social welfare 
function in which the players valuations are linear in their types 
 such as public-goods and auctions 
the implementability of the information-theoretically 
optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in 
mechanism design and first determine the optimal 
socialchoice rule and then calculate the appropriate payments 
that ensure incentive compatibility to show this result we 
prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for 
social-choice functions whose price of implementation is 
zero we show that for any social-choice function incentive 
compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent 
to the property that the optimal expected social value is 
achieved with non-decreasing strategies or threshold 
strategies 
in other words this lemma implies that one can 
always implement with dominant strategies the best 
socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies 
our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal 
action-bounded mechanisms we identify some necessary 
conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general and 
using these conditions we fully characterize the optimal 
mechanisms in environments with two players and two 
alternatives the optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal 
- that is in their matrix representation one alternative will 
be chosen in and only in entries below one of the main 
diagonals this term extends the concept of priority games 
used in for bounded-communication auctions we 
complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with 
the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are 
mutually maximizers since the payments in a 
dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone 
allocation and a profile of strategies this also defines the 
payments in the mechanism we give an intuitive proof for 
the optimality of such strategies generalizing the concept 
of optimal mutually-centered strategies from 
surprisingly as opposed to the optimal auctions in for some 
non-trivial social-value functions the optimal diagonal 
mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions 
theorem for any multilinear single-crossing social-value 
function over two alternatives the informationally optimal 
 -player k-action mechanism is diagonal and the optimal 
dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers 
achieving a full characterization of the optimal 
actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative 
environments seems to be harder to support this claim 
we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the 
necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the 
number of players 
 
the restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very 
common in the literature one remarkable result by athey 
shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response 
for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies a pure 
bayesian-nash equilibrium must exist 
our next result compares the expected social-value in 
k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value 
when the action space is unrestricted for any number of 
players or alternatives and for any profile of independent 
distribution functions we construct mechanisms that are 
nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of o 
k this 
result is achieved in dominant strategies 
theorem for any multilinear social-value function the 
optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss 
of o 
k 
this is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific 
environments in note that there are social-choice 
functions that can be implemented with k actions with no 
loss at all for example the rule always choose alternative 
a however we know that in some settings e g 
auctions the optimal loss may be proportional to 
k thus 
a better general upper bound is impossible 
finally we present our results in the context of several 
natural applications first we give an explicit solution for 
a public-good game with k-actions we show that the 
optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms in contrast to 
action-bounded auctions and that the optimal 
allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost 
c then we study the celebrated signaling model in which 
potential employees send signals about their skills to 
potential employers by means of the education level they acquire 
this is a natural application in our context since education 
levels are often discrete e g b a m a and phd lastly 
we present our results in the context of routing in networks 
where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether 
they have low or high loss rates but less reasonable to 
require them to report their accurate loss rates the latter 
example illustrates how our results apply to settings where 
the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization 
 nor variants of it like affine maximizers 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows our model 
and notations are described in section we then describe 
our general results regarding implementation in multi-player 
and multi-alternative environments in section including 
the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss in 
section we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 
 player environments with two alternative in section we 
conclude with applying our general results to several 
wellstudied models due to lack of space some of the proofs 
are missing and can be found in the full version that can be 
found on the authors web pages 
 model and preliminaries 
we first describe a standard mechanism-design model for 
players with one-dimensional types then in subsection 
 we impose limitation on the action space the 
general model studies environments with n players and a set 
a a a am of m alternatives each player has a 
privately known type θi ∈ θi θi where θi θi ∈ r θi θi 
and a type-dependent valuation function vi θi a for each 
alternative a ∈ a in other words player i with type θi is 
willing to pay an amount of vi θi a for alternative a to be 
chosen each type θi is independently distributed according 
to a publicly known distribution fi with an always positive 
density function fi we denote the set of all possible type 
profiles by θ ×n 
i θi θi 
 
the social planner has a social-choice function c θ → a 
where the choice of alternatives is made in order to maximize 
a social-value function g 
−→ 
θ θ × a → r that is c 
−→ 
θ ∈ 
argmaxa∈a g 
−→ 
θ a 
we assume that for every alternative a ∈ a the function 
g · a is continuous and differentiable in every type since 
the players types are private information in order to choose 
the optimal alternative the social planner needs to get the 
players types as an input the players reveal information 
about their types by choosing an action from an action set 
b 
each player uses a strategy for determining the action he 
plays for any possible type a strategy for player i is 
therefore a function si θi θi −→ b we denote a profile of 
strategies by s s sn and the set of the strategies of all 
players except i by s−i the utility of player i of type θi from 
alternative a under the payment pi is ui vi θi a − pi 
 dominant-strategy implementation 
following is a standard definition of a mechanism the 
action space b is traditionally implicit but we mention it 
explicitly since we later examine limitations on b 
definition a mechanism with an action set b is a 
pair t p where 
 t bn 
→ a is the allocation rule 
 p bn 
→ rn 
is the payment scheme i e pi b is the 
payment to the ith player given a vector of actions b 
the main goal of this paper is to optimize the expected 
social value in action-bounded mechanisms while preserving 
a dominant-strategy equilibrium 
we say that a strategy si is dominant for player i in 
mechanism t p if player i cannot increase his utility by reporting 
a different action than si θi regardless of the actions of the 
other players b−i 
definition we say that a social-choice function h is 
implementable with a set of actions b if there exists a 
mechanism t p with a dominant-strategy equilibrium s sn 
 where for each i si θi θi −→ b that always chooses an 
alternative according to h i e t s θ sn θn h 
−→ 
θ 
a fundamental result in the mechanism-design literature 
states that under the single-crossing condition the 
monotonicity of the social-choice function is a sufficient and 
necessary condition for dominant-strategy implementability 
 in single-parameter environments the single-crossing 
condition also known as the spence-mirrlees condition 
appears very often implicitly in almost every paper on 
mechanism design in one-dimensional domains without this 
assumption general sufficient condition for implementability 
are unknown for a survey on this topic see 
throughout this paper we assume that the valuation functions of 
the players are single-crossing as defined below a player s 
valuation function will be single-crossing if the effect of an 
increment in the player s type on the player s valuation for 
 
we will show that w l o g we can focus on deterministic 
allocation schemes 
 
that is for every type θi and every action bi we have 
that vi θi t si θi b−i -pi si θi b−i vi θi t bi b−i 
 pi bi b−i 
two alternatives is always greater for one of these 
alternatives the single-crossing condition on the players 
preferences actually defines an order on the alternatives for 
example if the value of player i for alternative a increases 
more rapidly than his value for alternative b we can denote 
it by a i b later on we will use these orders for defining 
monotonicity of social-choice functions 
definition a function h θ × a → r is single 
crossing with respect to i if there is a weak order i on the 
alternatives such that for any two alternatives aj i al we 
have that for every 
−→ 
θ ∈ θ 
∂h 
−→ 
θ aj 
∂θi 
 
∂h 
−→ 
θ al 
∂θi 
and if aj ∼ al that is al i aj and aj i al then 
h · aj ≡ h · al i e the functions are identical 
the definition of monotone social-choice functions also 
requires an order on the actions this order is implicit in 
most of the standard settings where for example it is 
defined by the order on the real numbers e g in direct 
revelation mechanisms where each type is drawn from a real 
interval when the action space is discrete the order can 
be determined by the names of the actions for example 
 k- for k-action mechanisms we therefore 
describe this order with the standard relation on natural 
numbers 
definition a deterministic mechanism is monotone 
if when player i raises his reported action and fixing the 
actions of the other players the mechanism never chooses 
an inferior alternative for i that is for any b−i ∈ k− 
 n− 
if bi bi then t bi b−i i t bi b−i 
following is a classic result regarding the implementability 
of social-choice functions in single-parameter environments 
note however that this characterization does not hold when 
the action space is bounded 
proposition assume that the valuation functions 
vi θi a are single crossing and that the action space is 
unrestricted a social-choice function c is dominant-strategy 
implementable if and only if c is monotone 
 action-bounded mechanisms 
the set of actions b is usually implicit in the literature 
and it is assumed to be isomorphic to the type space in this 
paper we study environments where this assumption does 
not hold we define a k-action game to be a game in which 
the number of possible actions for each player is k i e b 
k in k-action games the social planner typically cannot 
always choose an alternative according to the social choice 
function c due to the informational constraints instead 
we are interested in implementing a social-choice function 
that with k actions maximizes the expected social value 
e−→ 
θ 
g 
−→ 
θ t s θ sn θn 
 
 
definition we say that a social-choice function h 
θ → a is informationally achievable with a set of actions b 
if there exists a profile of strategies s sn where for each 
i si θi θi −→ b and an allocation rule t bn 
→ a 
such that t chooses the same alternative as h for any type 
profile i e t s θ t θn h 
−→ 
θ if b k we say 
that h is k-action informationally achievable 
 
note that this definition does not take into account 
strategic considerations for example consider an environment 
with two alternatives a a b and the following 
socialchoice function ec θ θ a iff θ and θ ec 
is informationally achievable with two actions if both 
players bid when their value is greater than and 
otherwise then the allocation rule choose alternative a iff 
both players report derives exactly the same allocation 
for every profile of types in contrast it is easy to see that 
the function ˆc θ θ a iff θ θ is not 
informationally achievable with two actions 
we now define a social-choice rule that maximizes the 
social value under the information-theoretic constraints that 
are implied by the limitations on the number of actions 
definition a social-choice function is k-action 
informationally optimal with respect to the social-value function 
g if it achieves the maximal expected social value among all 
the k-action informationally achievable social-choice 
functions 
earlier in this section we defined the single-crossing 
property for the players valuations we now define a 
singlecrossing property on the social-value function g this 
property clearly ensures the monotonicity of the corresponding 
social choice rule and we will later show that it is also useful 
for action-bounded environments 
definition we say that the social-choice rule g 
−→ 
θ a 
exhibits the single-crossing property if for every player i g 
exhibits the single-crossing property with respect to i 
note that the definition above requires that g will be 
single crossing with respect to every player i given her 
individual order i on the alternatives that is the social value 
function g will be compatible in this sense with the 
singlecrossing conditions on the players preferences 
finally we call attention to a natural set of strategies 
- non-decreasing strategies where each player reports a 
higher action as her type increases equivalently such 
strategies are threshold strategies - strategies where each 
player divides his type support into intervals and simply 
reports the interval in which her type lies 
definition a real vector x x x xk is a 
vector of threshold values if x ≤ x ≤ ≤ xk 
definition a strategy si is a threshold strategy based 
on a vector of threshold values x x x xk if for any 
action j it holds that si θi j iff θi ∈ xj xj a strategy 
si is called a threshold strategy if there exists a vector x of 
threshold values such that si is a threshold strategy based on 
x 
 implementation with a limited 
number of actions 
in this section we study the general model of 
actionbounded mechanism design our first result is a sufficient 
and necessary condition for the implementability of the 
optimal solution achievable with k actions this condition says 
that the optimal social-choice rule is achieved when all the 
 
for simplicity we assume that a maximum is attained and 
thus the optimal function is well defined 
players use non-decreasing strategies the basic idea is that 
with non-decreasing strategies i e threshold strategies we 
can apply the single-crossing property to show that when a 
player raises his reported action the expected value for his 
high-priority alternatives increases faster therefore 
monotonicity must hold the result holds for any number of 
players and alternatives and for any profile of distribution 
functions on the players types as long as they are statistically 
independent it is easy to illustrate that this result does 
not hold if the players types are dependent 
lemma consider a single-crossing social-value 
function g the informationally optimal k-action social-choice 
function c 
 with respect to g is implementable if and only if 
c 
achieves its optimum when the players use non-decreasing 
strategies 
next we show that for a wide family of social-value 
functions - multilinear functions - the price of implementation 
is zero that is the information-theoretically optimal rule 
is dominant-strategy implementable this family of 
functions captures many common settings from the literature 
in particular it generalizes the auction setting studied by 
blumrosen et al 
definition a multilinear function is a polynomial 
in which the degree of every variable in each monomial is at 
most 
we say that a social-choice rule g is multilinear 
if g · a is multilinear for every alternative a ∈ a 
the basic idea behind the proof of the following theorem is 
as follows for every player we show that the expected social 
welfare when he chooses any action fixing the strategies of 
the other players is a linear function of his type this is a 
result of the multilinearity of the social-value function and 
of the linearity of expectation the maximum over a set of 
linear functions is a piecewise-linear function hence the 
optimal social value is achieved when the player uses threshold 
strategies the thresholds are the switching points since 
the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies we can 
apply lemma to show the monotonicity of this 
socialchoice rule note that in this argument we characterize the 
players strategies that maximize the social value and not 
the players utilities 
theorem if the social-value function is multilinear 
and single crossing the informationally optimal k-action 
social-choice function is implementable 
proof we will show that for any k-action mechanism 
the optimal expected social value is achieved when all 
players use threshold strategies this will be shown by proving 
that for any player i and for any action bi of player i the 
expected welfare when she chooses the action bi is a 
linear function in player i s type θi then it will follow from 
lemma that the social choice function is implementable 
for every action bi of player i let qa denote the 
probability that alternative a is allocated i e 
qa pr−→ 
θ 
h 
t s 
−→ 
θ a si θi bi 
i 
 
for example f x y z xyz xy 
 
due to the linearity of expectation the expected social 
value when player i with type θi reports bi is 
x 
a∈a 
qa eθ−i g θi θ−i a t bi s−i θ−i a 
 
x 
a∈a 
qa 
z 
θ−i 
g θi θ−i a fa 
−i θ−i d θ−i 
where fa 
−i θ−i equals 
q 
j i fj θj 
qa 
for types profiles θ−i such 
that t bi s−i θ−i a and otherwise 
since g is multilinear every function g θi θ−i a is a 
linear function in θi where the coefficients depend on the 
values of θ−i denote this function by g θi θ−i a λθ−i θi 
βθ−i thus we can write equation as 
x 
a∈a 
qa 
z 
θ−i 
` 
λθ−i θi βθ−i 
´ 
fa 
−i θ−i d θ−i 
 
x 
a∈a 
qa θi 
z 
θ−i 
λθ−i fa 
−i θ−i d θ−i 
z 
θ−i 
βθ−i fa 
−i θ−i d θ−i 
 
in this expression each integral is a constant 
independent of θi when the strategies of the other player are fixed 
therefore each summand thus the whole function is a 
linear function in θi for achieving the optimal expected social 
value the player must choose the action that maximizes the 
expected social value a maximum of k linear functions is a 
piecewise-linear function with at most k− breaking points 
these breaking points are the thresholds to be used by the 
player for all types between subsequent thresholds the 
optimum is clearly achieved by a single action since linear 
functions are single-crossing every action will be maximal 
in at most one interval 
the same argument applies to all the players and 
therefore the optimal social value is obtained with threshold 
strategies 
observe that the proof of theorem actually works for 
a more general setting for proving that the 
informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold 
strategies it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function 
exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation given 
any allocation scheme and fixing the behavior of the other 
players the expected social value in any two actions as a 
function of θi is single crossing theorem shows that this 
requirement holds for multilinear functions but we were not 
able to give an exact characterization of this general class of 
functions 
the implementability of the information-theoretically 
optimal solution makes the characterization of the optimal 
incentive-compatible mechanisms significantly easier we 
can apply the standard mechanism-design technique and 
first calculate the optimal allocation scheme and then find 
the right payments 
observe that if the valuation functions of the players are 
linear and single crossing then the social-welfare function 
 i e the sum of the players valuations is multilinear and 
single-crossing this holds since the single-crossing 
conditions on the valuations are defined with a similar order on 
the alternatives as in the social-value function therefore 
an immediate conclusion from theorem is that the 
optimal social welfare which is achievable with k actions is 
implementable when the valuations are linear 
corollary if the valuation functions vi · a are 
single crossing and linear in θi for every player i and for every 
alternative then the informationally optimal k-action social 
welfare function is implementable 
 asymptotic analysis 
in this section we show that the social value loss of 
multilinear social-value rules diminishes quadratically with the 
number of possible actions k this is the same asymptotic 
ratio presented in the study of specific models in the same 
spirit the main challenge here compared 
to earlier results is in dealing with the general 
mechanismdesign framework that allows a large family of social-value 
functions for any number of players and alternatives as 
opposed to the specific models the social-value function may 
be asymmetric with respect to the players types for 
instance the social-value loss may a-priori occur in any 
entry i e profile of actions 
the basic intuition for the proof is that even for this 
general framework we can construct mechanisms where the 
probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with 
the original social-choice function is o 
k 
 this fact holds 
for all single-crossing social-choice functions not only for 
multilinear functions then we can use the multilinearity 
to show that the social-value loss will always be o 
k 
 in 
the mechanisms we construct taken together the expected 
loss becomes o 
k our proof is constructive - we present 
an explicit construction for a mechanism that exhibits the 
desired loss in dominant strategies the additive expected 
social-value depends on the length of the support of the type 
space hence we assume that the type space is normalized 
to that is for every player i θi and θi 
theorem assume that the type spaces are normalized 
to for any number of players and alternatives and 
for any set of distribution functions of the players types if 
the social-value function g is single crossing and 
multilinear then the informationally optimal k-action social-choice 
function with respect to g incurs an expected social-value 
loss of o 
k 
moreover as discussed in this bound is asymptotically 
tight that is there exists a set of distribution functions 
for the players the uniform distribution in particular and 
there are social-value functions e g auctions for which any 
mechanism incurs a social-value loss of at least ω 
k in 
that sense auctions are the hardest problems with respect to 
the incurred loss yet note that this claim does not imply 
that the loss of any social-choice function will be 
proportional to 
k for example in the social choice function that 
chooses the same alternative for any type profile no loss will 
be incurred even with actions 
 
 optimal mechanisms for two 
players and two alternatives 
in this section we present a full characterization of the 
optimal mechanisms in action-bounded environments with 
two players and two alternatives where the social-choice 
functions are multilinear and single crossing 
note that in this section as in most parts of this paper 
we characterize monotone mechanisms by their allocation 
scheme and by a profile of strategies for the players doing 
this we completely describe which alternative is chosen for 
every profile of types of the players it is well known that 
in monotone mechanisms for one dimensional environments 
the allocation scheme uniquely defines the payments in the 
dominant-strategy implementation we find this 
description which does not explicitly mention the payments easier 
for the presentation 
a key notion in our characterization of the optimal 
actionbounded mechanism is the notion of non-degenerate 
mechanisms in a degenerate mechanism there are two actions 
for one of the players that are identical in their allocation 
intuitively a degenrate mechanism does not utilize all the 
action space it is allowed to use and therefore it cannot 
be optimal using this propery we then define diagonal 
mechanisms that turns out to exactly characterize the set of 
optimal mechanisms 
definition a mechanism is degenerate with respect 
to player i if there exist two actions bi bi for player i such 
that for all profiles b−i of actions of the other players the 
allocation scheme is identical whether player i reports bi or 
bi i e ∀b−i t bi b−i t bi b−i 
for example a -player mechanism is degenerate with 
respect to the rows player if there are two rows with 
identical allocation in the matrix representation of the game 
definition a -player -alternative mechanism with 
k-possible actions is called diagonal if it is monotone and 
non-degenerate with respect to at least one of the players 
the term diagonal originates from the matrix 
representation of these mechanisms in which one of the diagonals 
determines the boundary between the choice of the two 
alternatives see figure simple combinatorial 
considerations show that diagonal mechanisms may come in very few 
forms interestingly one of these forms is degenerate with 
respect to one of the players that is it can be described as 
a mechanism with k − actions for this player 
proposition any diagonal -player mechanism has 
one of the following forms 
 if both players favor the same alternative w l o g 
b i a for i then either 
 a t b b b iff b b ≥ k − 
 b t b b b iff b b ≥ k 
 if the two players have conflicting preferences e g 
a b and b a then either 
 a t b b b iff b ≥ b 
 b t b b b iff b b 
in both cases the optimal mechanism can also take the 
form of one of the possibilities described except one of the 
players is not allowed to choose the fixed allocation action 
to complete the description of the optimal allocation 
scheme we now move to determine the optimal strategies 
in diagonal mechanisms we define the notion of 
mutuallymaximizer thresholds and show that threshold strategies 
based on such thresholds are optimal the reason why 
mutually-maximizer strategies maximize the expected social 
value in monotone mechanisms is intuitive consider some 
action i row in the matrix representation for player in 
a monotone mechanism the allocation in such a row will be 
of the form a a b b assuming that b a that 
is the alternative a will be chosen for low actions of player 
 and the alternative b will be chosen for higher actions of 
player by determining a threshold for player the social 
planner actually determines the minimal type of player 
from which the alternative b will be chosen for 
optimizing the expected social value this type for player should 
clearly be the type for which the expected social value from 
a equals the expected social value from b given that player 
 plays i for greater values of player the single-crossing 
condition ensures that b will be preferred 
definition consider a monotone -player 
mechanism g that is non-degenerate with respect to the two 
players where the players use threshold strategies based on the 
threshold vectors x y we say that the threshold xi of one 
player w l o g player is a maximizer if 
eθ g xi θ a θ ∈ yj yj 
eθ g xi θ b θ ∈ yj yj 
where j is the action of player for which the mechanism 
swaps the chosen alternative exactly when player plays i 
i e t i j t i − j we denote w l o g t i j a 
t i − j b 
the threshold vectors x y are called mutually maximizers 
if all their thresholds are maximizers except the first and 
the last 
it turns out that in -player -alternative environments 
where the social-choice rule is multilinear and single 
crossing the optimal expected social value is achieved in 
diagonal mechanisms with mutually-maximizer strategies in the 
proof we start with a k × k allocation matrix and show 
that the mechanism cannot be degenerate with respect to 
one of the players we show how to choose this player if 
the player w l o g the columns player is degenerate then 
there are two columns with an identical allocation these 
two columns can be unified to a single action and the 
mechanism can therefore be described as a k × k − matrix we 
then show that we can insert a new missing column and 
an appropriately chosen threshold and strictly increase the 
expected social value in the mechanism therefore the 
original mechanism was not the optimal k-action mechanism 
theorem in environments with two alternatives and 
two players if the social-value function is multilinear and 
single crossing then the optimal k-action mechanism is 
diagonal and the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies 
that are mutually maximizers 
a corollary from the proof of theorem is that the optimal 
 -player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of 
the players that is equivalent to a game where one of the 
players has only k − different actions however the proof 
identifies the following sufficient condition under which the

figure the three left tables show all possible diagonal allocation scheme with possible actions for each player 
the rightmost table show an example for a diagonal allocation scheme where one of the player has only k − possible 
actions 
optimal mechanism will be non-degenerate with respect to 
both players if the players preferences are correlated e g 
a b and a b then the optimal alternative must be 
the same under the profiles θ θ and θ θ similarly 
if the players preferences are conflicting e g a b and 
b a then the optimal alternative must be the same 
under the profiles θ θ and θ θ examples in which 
this condition holds are the public good model presented in 
section and auctions 
we do not know how to give an exact characterization of 
the optimal mechanisms in multi-player and multi-alternati 
ve environments the hardness stems from the fact that the 
necessary conditions we specified before for the optimality 
of the mechanisms i e non-degenrate and monotone 
allocations are not restrictive enough for the general model in 
other words for n players the number of monotone and 
non-degenerate mechanisms becomes exponential in n 
proposition the number of monotone non- 
degenerate k-action mechanisms in an n-player game is exponential 
in n even if a 
 examples 
our results apply to a variety of economic computational 
and networked settings in this section we demonstrate the 
applicability of our results to public-good models signaling 
games and routing applications 
 application public goods 
the public-good model deals with a social planner e g 
government that needs to decide whether to supply a 
public good such as building a bridge let y es and no denote 
the respective alternatives of building and not building the 
bridge v v vn is the vector of the players 
typesthe values they gain from using the bridge the decision that 
maximizes the social welfare is to build the bridge if and only 
if 
p 
i vi is greater than its cost denoted by c if the bridge 
is built the social welfare is 
p 
i vi − c and zero otherwise 
thus g v y es 
p 
i vi − c and g v no the utility 
of player i under payment pi is ui vi − pi if the bridge is 
built and otherwise it is well-known that under no 
restriction on the action space it is possible to induce truthful 
revelation by vcg mechanisms therefore full efficiency can 
be achieved obviously when the action set is limited to 
k actions we cannot achieve full efficiency due to the 
informational constraints yet since g v y es and g v no 
are multilinear and single crossing we can directly apply 
theorem hence the information-theoretically optimal 
kaction mechanism is implementable in dominant strategies 
corollary the k-action informationally optimal 
social welfare in the n-player public-good game is 
implementable in dominant strategies 
moreover as theorem suggests in the k-action -player 
public-good game we can fully characterize the optimal 
mechanisms in the proof of theorem we saw that when 
for both players g θi θi a g θi θi b the mechanism is 
non-degenerate with respect to both players 
this 
condition clearly holds here − c − c therefore the 
optimal mechanisms will use all k actions 
corollary the optimal expected welfare in a -player 
k-action public-good game is achieved with one of the 
following mechanisms 
 allocation build the bridge iff b b ≥ k 
strategies threshold strategies based on the vectors 
−→x −→y where for every ≤ i ≤ k- 
xi c − e v v ∈ yk−i yk−i 
yi c − e v v ∈ xk−i xk−i 
 allocation build the bridge iff b b ≥ k − 
strategies threshold strategies based on the vectors 
−→x −→y where for every ≤ i ≤ k- 
xi c − e v v ∈ yk−i− yk−i 
yi c − e v v ∈ xk−i− xk−i 
recall that we define the optimal mechanisms by their 
allocation scheme and by the optimal strategies for the 
players it is well known that the allocation scheme in 
monotone mechanisms uniquely defines the payments that ensure 
incentive-compatibility in public-good games these 
payments satisfy the rule that a player pays his lowest value for 
which the bridge is built when the action of the other player 
is fixed therefore the payments for the players and 
reporting the actions b and b are as follows in mechanism 
 from proposition p xb and p yb in mechanism 
 from proposition p xb − and p yb − 
we now show a more specific example that assumes 
uniform distributions the example shows how the optimal 
mechanism is determined by the cost c for low costs 
mechanism of type is optimal and for high costs the optimal 
mechanism is of type an additional interesting feature of 
the optimal mechanisms in the example is that they are 
symmetric with respect to the players this come as opposed to 
the optimal mechanisms in the auction model that are 
asymmetric even when the players values are drawn from 
identical distributions 
 
more precisely the condition for non-degeneracy when 
b a and b a is that sign g θi θi a −g θi θi b 
sign g θi θi a − g θi θi b when sign is considered

 application signaling 
we now study a signaling model in labor markets in 
this model the type of each worker θi ∈ θ θ describes 
the worker s productivity level the firm wants to make her 
hiring decisions according to a decision function f 
−→ 
θ for 
example the firm may want to hire the most productive 
worker like the auction model or hire a group of 
workers only if their sum of productivities is greater than some 
threshold similar to the public-good model however the 
worker s productivity is invisible to the firm the firm only 
observes the worker s education level e that should convey 
signals about her productivity level note that the 
assumption here is that acquiring education at any level does not 
affect the productivity of the worker but only signals about 
the worker s skills 
a main component in this model is the fact that as the 
worker is more productive it is easier for him to acquire 
high-level education in addition the cost of acquiring 
education increases with the education level more formally 
a continuous function c e θ describes the cost to a worker 
from acquiring each education level as a function of his 
productivity the standard assumptions about the cost 
function are ∂c 
∂e 
 ∂c 
∂θ 
 ∂c 
∂e∂θ 
 where the latter 
requirement is exactly equivalent to the single-crossing 
property when c is differentiable in both variables the utility 
of a worker is determined according to the education level he 
chooses and the wage w e attached to this education level 
that is ui e θi −c θi e w e 
an action for a worker in this game is the education level 
he chooses to acquire in standard models this action space 
is continuous and then a fully separating equilibrium 
exists under the single-crossing conditions on the cost 
function that is there exists an equilibrium in which every 
type is mapped into a different education level thus the 
firm can induce the exact productivity levels of the workers 
by this signaling mechanism however it is hard to imagine 
a world with a continuum of education levels it is usually 
the case that there are only several discrete education levels 
 e g bsc msc phd 
with k education levels the firm may not be able to 
exactly follow the decision function f for achieving the best 
result in k actions the firm may want the workers to play 
according to specific threshold strategies it turns out that the 
standard condition the single-crossing condition on the cost 
function suffices for ensuring that these threshold strategies 
will be dominant for the players we can now apply 
theorem and show that if the decision function f of the firm 
is multilinear i e the decisions are made to maximize a 
set of multilinear functions then the firm can design the 
education system such that the expected loss will be o 
k 
with a dominant-strategy equilibrium note that while in 
the classic example of the job market it is not reasonable for 
each firm to select the education level in other reasonable 
applications the social planners may be able to determine 
the thresholds e g by fixing the levels of qualifying exams 
or other means for the players to demonstrate their skills 
corollary consider a multilinear decision function 
f and a single-crossing cost function for the players with k 
education levels the firm can implement in dominant 
strategies a decision function that incurs a loss of o 
k compared 
with the decision function f 
 application routing 
in our last example we show the applicability of our 
results to routing in lossy networks in such systems a sender 
needs to decide through which network to transmit his 
message it is natural to assume that the agents i e links may 
not be able to report their accurate probabilities of success 
but only e g whether these are low intermediate or 
high in this example we focus on parallel-path networks 
let n n denote two networks where each network is 
composed of multiple parallel paths with variable lengths 
from a given source to a given sink an example for such a 
network appears in figure the edges in these networks 
are controlled by different selfish agents and each edge 
appears only in one of the networks suppose that the sender 
who wishes to send a message from the source to the sink 
knows the topology of each network but the probability of 
success on each link pi is the link s private information 
the problem of the sender is to decide whether to send a 
message through the network n or through an alternate 
network n obviously the sender wishes to send the 
message through n only if the total probability of success in n 
is greater than the success probability in n let fn 
 −→p 
denote the probability of success in network n with a 
successprobability vector −→p the social choice function in this 
example is thus c −→p ∈ argmax n n fn 
 −→p fn 
 −→p 
 
p p 
p 
p p 
s t 
figure an example for a parallel-path network 
where each link has a probability pi for transmission 
success we show that the overall probability of success in 
such networks is multilinear in pi and thus the optimal 
k-action social-choice function is dominant-strategy 
implementable 
in this example we assume that every agent has a 
singlecrossing valuation function over the alternatives that is 
each player wishes that the message will be sent through 
his network and his benefit is positively correlated with his 
secret data e g the valuation of player i may be exactly 
pi we would like to emphasize that the social planner 
in this example the sender does not aim to maximize the 
social welfare that is the social value is not the sum of the 
players types nor any weighted sum of the types affine 
maximizer 
the success probability of sending a message through a 
parallel-path network is multilinear since it can be expressed 
by the following multilinear formula where p denotes the 
set of all paths between the source and the sink 
 − 
y 
p ∈p 
 − 
y 
j∈p 
pj 
for example in the network presented in figure the 
probability of success is given by 
f −→p − − p p · − p · − p p 
thus if all the candidate networks are parallel-path 
networks the social-value function is multilinear and we can 
apply theorem and get the following corollary note that 
for every link i the partial derivative in pi of the success 
probability written in equation is positive in all the other 
networks that do not contain link i the partial derivative 
is clearly zero therefore the social-value function is single 
crossing and our general results can be applied 
corollary for any social-choice function that 
maximizes the success probability over parallel-path networks 
the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function 
is implementable for any k
