we develop a framework for trading in compound securities 
financial instruments that pay off contingent on the 
outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic buying 
or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on 
or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both 
to hedge risk and to profit in expectation on subjective 
predictions a compound securities market allows agents 
to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events 
enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk 
exposure and enabling the market as a whole to more closely 
achieve the social optimum the tradeoff for allowing such 
expressivity is in the complexity of the agents and 
auctioneer s optimization problems 
we develop and motivate the concept of a compound 
securities market presenting the framework through a series 
of formal definitions and examples we then analyze in 
detail the auctioneer s matching problem we show that with 
n events the matching problem is co-np-complete in the 
divisible case and σp 
 -complete in the indivisible case we 
show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe 
language restrictions on bids with log n events the 
problem is polynomial in the divisible case and np-complete in 
the indivisible case we briefly discuss matching algorithms

 introduction 
securities markets effectively allow traders to place bets 
on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions examples 
include stock markets like nasdaq options markets like 
cboe futures markets like cme other derivatives 
markets insurance markets political stock markets 
sports betting markets horse racing markets 
idea futures markets decision markets and even 
market games the economic value of securities 
markets is two-fold first they allow traders to hedge risk 
or to insure against undesirable outcomes for example the 
owner of a stock might buy a put option the right to sell 
the stock at a particular price in order to insure against 
a stock downturn or the owner of a house may purchase 
an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage 
to the house second securities markets allow traders to 
speculate or to obtain a subjective expected profit when 
market prices do not reflect their assessment of the 
likelihood of future outcomes for example a trader might buy 
a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that 
the price of the underlying stock will go up regardless of 
risk exposure to changes in the stock price because traders 
stand to earn a profit if they can make effective 
probability assessments often prices in financial markets yield very 
accurate aggregate forecasts of future events 
real securities markets have complex payoff structures 
with various triggers however these can all be modeled 
as collections of more basic or atomic arrow-debreu 
securities one unit of one arrow-debreu security pays 
off one dollar if and only if iff a corresponding binary event 
occurs it pays nothing if the event does not occur so for 
example one unit of a security denoted acme might 
pay iff acme s stock is above on january 
an acme stock option as it would be defined on a 
finan 
cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic 
securities 
in this paper we develop and analyze a framework for 
trading in compound securities markets with payoffs 
contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events including 
conditionals for example given binary events a b and 
c one trader might bid to buy three units of a security 
denoted a ∧ ¯b ∨ c that pays off iff the compound event 
a ∧ ¯b ∨ c occurs for thirty cents each another trader may 
bid to sell six units of a security a c that pays off iff 
a occurs for fifty-five cents each conditional on event c 
occurring meaning that the transaction is revoked if c does 
not occur i e no payoff is given and the price of the 
security is refunded bids may also be divisible meaning 
that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested 
quantity or indivisible meaning that bids must be fulfilled 
either completely or not at all given a set of such bids 
the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide 
which bids are accepted for how many units at what price 
typically the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own 
only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders but 
we also consider alternative formulations where the 
auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk 
we examine the computational complexity of the 
auctioneer s matching problem let the length of the description 
of all the available securities be o n with n events the 
matching problem is co-np-complete in the divisible case 
and σp 
 -complete in the indivisible case this σp 
 -complete 
hardness holds even when the bidding language is 
significantly restricted with log n events the problem is 
polynomial in the divisible case and np-complete in the indivisible 
case 
section presents some necessary background 
information motivation and related work section formally 
describes our framework for compound securities and defines 
the auctioneer s matching problem section briefly 
discusses natural algorithms for solving the matching problem 
section proves our central computational complexity 
results section discusses the possibility of tractable special 
cases section concludes with a summary and some ideas 
of future directions 
 preliminaries 
 background and notation 
imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain 
events of any consequence the event that one s house is 
struck by lightning by december denoted struck 
and the event that acme s stock price goes above 
by january denoted acme in this simple world 
there are four possible future states-all possible 
combinations of the binary events outcomes 
struck ∧ acme 
struck ∧ acme 
struck ∧ acme 
struck ∧ acme 
hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money 
between various possible future states for example 
insur 
technically an option is a portfolio of infinitely many 
atomic securities though it can be approximately modeled 
with a finite number 
ing one s house transfers money from future states where 
struck is not true to states where it is selling a security 
denoted acme -that pays off iff the event acme 
occurs-transfers money from future states where acme s 
price is above on january to states where it s not 
speculating is also an act of transferring money between 
future states though usually associated with maximizing 
expected return rather than reducing risk for example 
betting on a football team moves money from the team 
loses state to the team wins state in practice agents 
engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating and there 
is no clear dividing line between the two 
all possible future outcomes form a state space ω 
consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ ω 
often a more natural way to think of possible future 
outcomes is as an event space a of linearly independent events 
a ∈ a that may overlap arbitrarily so in our toy example 
struck ∧ acme is one of the four disjoint states while 
struck is one of the two events note that a set of n 
linearly independent events defines a state space ω of size n 
consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes 
conversely any state space ω can be factored into log ω 
events 
suppose that a exhaustively covers all meaningful future 
outcomes i e covers all eventualities that agents may wish 
to hedge against and or speculate upon then the 
existence of n 
linearly independent securities-called a 
complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth 
arbitrarily across future states 
an agent may create any hedge 
or speculation it desires under classical conditions agents 
trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk 
is allocated pareto optimally if the market is incomplete 
meaning it consists of fewer than n 
linearly independent 
securities then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary 
hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal 
 
in real-world settings the number of meaningful events n 
is large and thus the number of securities required for 
completeness is intractable no truly complete market exists or 
will ever exist one motivation behind compound securities 
markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most 
transfer of risk using the least number of transactions 
possible compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity 
in constructing bids the tradeoff for increased expressivity 
is increased computational complexity from both the 
bidder s and auctioneer s point of view 
 related work 
the quest to reduce the number of financial instruments 
required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to 
arrow s original work the requirement stated above of 
only n 
linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction 
from the most straightforward formulation in an economy 
with k standard goods the most straightforward complete 
market contains k· n 
securities each paying off in one good 
under one state realization arrow showed that a market 
where securities and goods are essentially separated with 
 n 
securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k 
spot markets in the standard goods is also complete for 
our purposes we need consider only the securities market 
 
by linearly independent securities we mean that the 
vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are 
linearly independent 
 
varian shows that a complete market can be 
constructed using fewer than n 
securities replacing the 
missing securities with options still the number of linearly 
independent financial instruments-securities plus 
optionsmust be n 
to guarantee completeness 
though the requirement of n 
financial instruments 
cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in 
all circumstances pennock and wellman explore 
conditions under which a smaller securities market may be 
operationally complete meaning that its equilibrium is pareto 
optimal with respect to the agents involved even if the market 
contains less than n 
securities the authors show that in 
some cases the market can be structured and compacted 
in analogy to bayesian network representations of joint 
probability distributions they show that if all agents 
risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies 
encoded in the market structure then the market is 
operationally complete for collections of agents all with constant 
absolute risk aversion agreement on markov independencies 
is sufficient 
bossaerts fine and ledyard develop a mechanism 
they call combined-value trading cvt that allows traders 
to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid rather 
than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on 
individual securities if the portfolio order is accepted all of 
the implied trades on individual securities are executed 
simultaneously thus eliminating so-called execution risk that 
prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of 
orders the authors conduct laboratory experiments showing 
that even in thin markets where ordinary sequential 
trading breaks down cvt supports efficient pricing and 
allocation note that cvt differs significantly from compound 
securities trading cvt allows instantaneous trading of any 
linear combination of securities while compound securities 
allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear 
boolean combinations of events for example cvt may 
allow an agent to order securities a and b in a bundle that 
pays off as a linear combination of a and b 
but cvt won t 
allow the construction of a compound security a ∧ b that 
pays off iff both a and b occur or a compound security 
a b 
related to cvt are combinatorial auctions and 
exchanges mechanisms that have recently received quite 
a bit of attention in the economics and computer science 
literatures combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place 
distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just 
on individual goods in this way bidders can express 
substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods 
that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential 
auctions compound securities differ from combinatorial 
auctions in concept and complexity compound securities 
allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the n 
possible compound events expressible as logical functions of 
the n base events conditional on any other of the n 
 
compound events agents optimize based on their own 
subjective probabilities and risk attitude and in general their 
beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities ad infinitum 
the central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage 
opportunities that is to match bets together without taking 
on any risk combinatorial auctions on the other hand 
allow bids on any of the n 
bundles of n goods typically 
 
specifically one unit of each pays off iff both a and b 
occur iff a or b occurs but not both and otherwise 
uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered the central 
auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare also note 
that the problems lie in different complexity classes while 
clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the 
divisible case and np-complete in the indivisible case matching 
in a compound securities market is np-complete in the 
divisible case and σp 
 -complete in the indivisible case in fact 
even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound 
securities match even in the divisible case is np-complete 
 see section 
there is a sense in which it is possible to translate our 
matching problem for compound securities into an 
analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges 
 of exponential size specifically if we regard payoff in a 
particular state as a good then compound securities can be 
viewed as bundles of fractional quantities of such goods 
the material balance constraint facing the combinatorial 
auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the 
compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk 
note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing 
the compound-security matching problem as the resulting 
combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods 
hanson develops a market mechanism called a market 
scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets 
on a combinatorial number of outcomes the mechanism 
maintains a joint probability distribution over all n 
states 
either explicitly or implicitly using a bayesian network or 
other compact representation at any time any trader who 
believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part 
of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays 
off according to a scoring rule e g the logarithmic 
scoring rule as long as that trader also agrees to pay off 
the most recent person to change the distribution in the 
limit of a single trader the mechanism behaves like a 
scoring rule suitable for polling a single agent for its 
probability distribution in the limit of many traders it produces a 
combined estimate since the market essentially always has 
a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes 
the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or 
illiquidity that necessarily plagues any market containing an 
exponential number of alternative investments the 
mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change 
the distribution though the patron s payment is bounded 
though hanson offers some initial suggestions several open 
problems remain including efficient methods for 
representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders 
positions and portfolios without resorting to exponential 
time and space algorithms 
fagin halpern and megiddo give a sound and 
complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of 
probabilistic inequalities are consistent bids for compound securities 
can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic 
inequalities for example a bid to buy a ∧ b at price is a 
statement that the probability of a ∧ b is greater than 
if a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent 
probabilistic inequalities then there is a match however 
because they are interested in a much different framework 
fagin et al do not consider several complicating factors 
specific to the securities market framework namely handling 
multi-unit or fractional bid quantities identifying matches 
choosing among multiple matches and optimizing based on 
probabilities and risk attitudes we address these issues 
below 
 
 framework for trading in 
compound securities 
 high-level description 
common knowledge among agents is the set of events a 
there are no predefined securities instead agents offer to 
buy or sell securities of their own design that pay off 
contingent on logical combinations of events and event negations 
combination operators may include conjunctions 
disjunctions and conditionals 
for all practical purposes it is impossible for agents to 
trade in enough securities n 
 to form a complete market 
so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the 
number and complexity of their bids and the extent to which 
their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed in its 
most general form the problem is game-theoretic in nature 
since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes 
other agents will accept at the other end of the spectrum a 
simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on 
currently available securities at current prices in between 
these two formulations are other possible interesting 
optimization problems approximation algorithms might also 
be pursued 
the auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy 
and sell orders to maximize surplus the cash and securities 
left over after accepted bids are fulfilled for example offers 
to sell a a at and a 
¯a at can match with an 
offer to buy a at with surplus or an offer to 
sell a at can match with an offer to buy a a at 
 with surplus in cash and a 
¯a in securities in 
general a single security might qualify for multiple matches 
but only one can be transacted so the auctioneer must find 
the optimal set of matches that maximizes surplus which 
could be measured in a number of ways again 
approximation algorithms might be considered in another 
formulation the auctioneer functions as a market maker willing to 
take on a certain amount of risk 
informally our motivation is to provide a mechanism that 
allows a very high degree of expressivity in placing hedges 
and bets and is also capable of approximating the optimal 
 complete-market allocation of risk trading off the number 
and complexity of securities and transactions needed 
 formal description 
 securities 
we use φ and ψ to denote arbitrary boolean formulas or 
logical combinations of events in a we denote securities 
φ ψ securities pay off if and only if iff φ and ψ are 
true pay off iff φ is false and ψ is true and are canceled 
 i e any price paid is refunded iff ψ is false we define 
t ≡ ω to be the event true and f ≡ ∅ to be the event 
false we abbreviate φ t as φ 
 orders 
agents place orders denoted o of the form q units of 
φ ψ at price p per unit where q implies a buy 
order and q implies a sell order we assume agents 
submitting buy sell orders will accept any price p 
≤ p 
 p 
≥ p we distinguish between divisible and indivisible 
orders agents submitting divisible orders will accept any 
quantity αq where α ≤ agents submitting 
indivisible orders will accept only exactly q units or none at all 
we believe that given the nature of what is being traded 
 state-contingent dollars most agents will be content to 
trade using divisible orders 
every order o can be translated into a payoff vector υ 
across all states ω ∈ ω the payoff υ ω 
in state ω is q · 
 ω∈ψ ω∈φ − p where ω∈e equals iff ω ∈ e and zero 
otherwise recall that the n 
states correspond to the n 
possible combinations of event outcomes we index multiple 
orders with subscripts e g oi and υi let the set of all 
orders be o and the set of all corresponding payoff vectors 
be p 
example translating orders into payoff vectors 
suppose that a consider an order to buy two units of 
a ∨ a a at price the corresponding payoff vector 
is 
υ υ a a a 
 υ a a

 the matching problem 
the auctioneer s task called the matching problem is to 
determine which orders to accept among all orders o ∈ o 
let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer 
 in the indivisible case αi must be either or in the 
divisible case αi can range from to if αi then 
order oi is considered rejected and no transactions take place 
concerning this order for accepted orders αi the 
auctioneer receives the money lost by bidders and pays out 
the money won by bidders so the auctioneer s payoff vector 
is 
υauc 
x 
υi∈p 
−αiυi 
we also call the auctioneer s payoff vector the surplus vector 
since it is the possibly state-contingent money left over 
after all accepted orders are filled 
assume that the auctioneer wants to choose a set of orders 
so that it is guaranteed not to lose any money in any future 
state but that the auctioneer does not necessarily insist on 
obtaining a positive benefit from the transaction i e the 
auctioneer is content to break even 
definition matching problem indivisible case given 
a set of orders o does there exist αi ∈ with at least 
one αi such that 
∀ω υ ω 
auc ≥ 
in other words does there exist a nonempty subset of orders 
that the auctioneer can accept without risk 
if ∀ω υ 
ω 
auc c where c is nonnegative then the surplus 
leftover after processing this match is c dollars let m 
minω υ 
ω 
auc in general processing a match leaves m dollars 
in cash and υ 
ω 
auc − m in state-contingent dollars which can 
then be translated into securities 
example indivisible order matching suppose a 
 consider an order to buy one unit of a a at price 
 and an order to sell one unit of a at price the 
 
corresponding payoff vectors are 
υ υ 
a a 
 υ 
a 
¯a 
 υ 
¯a a 
 υ 
¯a 
¯a 
 
 − − − 
υ − − 
the auctioneer s payoff vector the negative of the 
componentwise sum of the above two vectors is 
υauc −υ − υ 
since all components are nonnegative the two orders match 
the auctioneer can process both orders leaving a surplus of 
 in cash and one unit of a 
¯a in securities 
now consider the divisible case where order can be 
partially filled 
definition matching problem divisible case given 
a set of orders o does there exist αi ∈ with at least 
one αi such that 
∀ω υ ω 
auc ≥ 
 
example divisible order matching suppose a 
consider an order to sell one unit of a at price an 
order to buy one unit of a a a ∨ a at price and 
an order to buy one unit of a ¯a at price the 
corresponding payoff vectors are 
υ υ 
a a 
 υ 
a 
¯a 
 υ 
¯a a 
 υ 
¯a 
¯a 
 
 − − 
υ − − 
υ − 
it is clear by inspection that no non-empty subset of whole 
orders constitutes a match in all cases where αi ∈ 
 other than all αi at least one state sums to a positive 
amount negative for the auctioneer however if α 
α and α then the auctioneer s payoff vector is 
υauc − 
 
 
υ − 
 
 
υ − υ 
constituting a match the auctioneer can process of the 
first and second orders and all of the third order leaving a 
surplus of units of ¯a 
¯a in this example a divisible 
match exists even though an indivisible match is not possible 
we examine the distinction in detail in section where we 
separate the two matching problems into distinct complexity 
classes 
the matching problems defined above are decision 
problems the task is only to show the existence or nonexistence 
of a match however there may be multiple matches from 
which the auctioneer can choose sometimes the choices are 
equivalent from the auctioneer s perspective alternatively 
an objective function can be used to find an optimal match 
according to that objective 
example auctioneer alternatives i suppose a 
 consider an order to sell one unit of a at price 
an order to sell one unit of a at price an order to 
buy one unit of a a at price an order to buy one 
unit of a 
¯a at price and an order to buy one unit 
of ¯a a at price the corresponding payoff vectors 
are 
υ − − 
υ − − 
υ − − − 
υ − − − 
υ − − − 
consider the indivisible case the auctioneer could choose 
to accept bids and together or the auctioneer could 
choose to accept bids and together both constitute 
matches and in fact both yield identical payoffs υauc 
 or in cash for the auctioneer 
example auctioneer alternatives ii suppose a 
 consider an order to sell two units of a at price 
an order to buy one unit of a a at price and an 
order to buy one unit of a 
¯a at price the 
corresponding payoff vectors are 
υ − − 
υ − − − 
υ − − − 
consider the divisible case the auctioneer could choose to 
accept one unit each of all three bids yielding a payoff to 
the auctioneer of in cash υauc 
alternatively the auctioneer could choose to accept units 
of bid and one unit each of bids and yielding a payoff 
to the auctioneer of units of security a both choices 
constitute matches in fact accepting any number of units 
of bid between and can be part of a match though 
depending on the auctioneer s objective one choice might 
be preferred over another for example if the auctioneer 
believes that a is very likely to occur it may prefer to accept 
 units of bid 
there are many possible criteria for the auctioneer to 
decide among matches all of which seem reasonable in some 
circumstances one natural quantity to maximize is the 
volume of trade among bidders another is the auctioneer s 
utility either with or without the arbitrage constraint 
definition trade maximization problem given a set 
of indivisible divisible orders o choose αi ∈ αi ∈ 
 to maximize 
x 
i 
αiqi 
under the constraint that 
∀ω υ ω 
auc ≥ 
 
another reasonable variation is to maximize the total 
percent of orders filled or 
p 
i αi under the same risk-free 
constraint that ∀ω υ 
ω 
auc ≥ 
definition auctioneer risk-free utility-maximization 
problem let the auctioneer s subjective probability for each 
state ω be pr ω and let the auctioneer s utility for y 
dollars be u y given a set of indivisible divisible orders o 
choose αi ∈ αi ∈ to maximize 
x 
ω∈ω 
pr ω u υ ω 
auc 
 
under the constraint that 
∀ω υ ω 
auc ≥ 
 
definition auctioneer standard utility-maximization 
problem let the auctioneer s subjective probability for each 
state ω be pr ω and let the auctioneer s utility for y 
dollars be u y given a set of indivisible divisible orders o 
choose αi ∈ αi ∈ to maximize 
x 
ω∈ω 
pr ω u 
 
υ ω 
auc 
 
 
 
this last objective function drops the risk-free arbitrage 
constraint in this case the auctioneer is a market maker 
with beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes and the 
auctioneer may actually lose money is some outcomes 
still other variations and other optimization criteria seem 
reasonable including social welfare etc it also seems 
reasonable to suppose that the surplus be shared among bidders 
and the auctioneer rather than retained solely by the 
auctioneer this is analogous to choosing a common transaction 
price in a double auction e g the midpoint between the bid 
and ask prices rather than the buyer paying the bid price 
and the seller receiving the ask price with the difference 
going to the auctioneer the problem becomes more 
complicated when dividing surplus securities in part because 
they are valued differently by different agents formulating 
reasonable sharing rules and examining the resulting 
incentive properties seems a rich and promising avenue for further 
investigation 
 matching algorithms 
the straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible 
matching problem is linear programming we set up an 
appropriate linear program in section the straightforward 
algorithm for solving the indivisible matching problem is 
integer programming with n events to set up the 
appropriate linear or integer programs simply writing out the payoff 
vectors in the straightforward way requires o n 
 space 
there is some hope that specialized algorithms that 
exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of 
average-case time and space complexity for example in 
some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction 
techniques without writing down the full payoff vectors so 
a match between the following bids 
 sell of a a at 
 sell of a 
¯a at 
 buy of a at 
can be identified by reducing the first two bids to an 
equivalent offer to sell a at that clearly matches with 
the third bid formalizing a logical-reduction algorithm for 
matching or other algorithms that can exploit special 
structure among the bids is a promising avenue for future work 
 the computational complexity 
of matching 
in this section we examine the computational complexity 
of the auctioneer s matching problem here n refers to the 
problem s input size that includes descriptions of all of the 
buy and sell orders we also assume that n bounds the 
number of base securities 
we consider four cases based on two parameters 
 whether to allow divisible or indivisible orders 
 the number of securities we consider two 
possibilities 
 a o log n base securities yielding a polynomial 
number of states 
 b an unlimited number of base securities yielding 
an exponential number of states 
we show the following results 
theorem the matching problem is 
 computable in polynomial-time for o log n base 
securities with divisible orders 
 co-np-complete for unlimited securities with divisible 
orders 
 np-complete for o log n base securities with 
indivisible orders 
 σp 
 -complete for unlimited securities with indivisible 
orders 
 small number of securities with divisible 
orders 
we can build a linear program based on definition we 
have variables αi for each i we have 
 ≤ αi ≤ 
and for each state ω in ω we have the constraint 
υ ω 
auc 
x 
i 
−αiυ 
ω 
i ≥ 
given these constraints we maximize 
x 
i 
αi 
a set of orders has a matching exactly when 
p 
i αi 
with o log n base securities we have ω bounded by a 
polynomial so we can solve this linear program in polynomial 
time 
note that one might argue that one should maximize some 
linear combination of the −υ 
ω 
i s to maximize the surplus 
however this approach will not find matchings that have 
zero surplus 
 large number of securities with divisible 
orders 
with unlimited base securities the linear program given 
in section has an exponential number of constraint 
equations each constraint is short to describe and easily 
computable given ω 
 
let m ≤ n be the total number of buy and sell orders 
by the theory of linear programming an upper bound on 
the objective function can be forced by a collection of m 
constraints so if no matching exists there must exist m 
constraints that force all the αi to zero in nondeterministic 
polynomial-time we can guess these constraints and solve 
the reduced linear program this shows that matching is in 
co-np 
to show co-np-completeness we reduce the np-complete 
problem of boolean formula satisfiability to the nonexistence 
of a matching fix a formula φ let the base securities be 
the variables of φ and consider the single security φ with 
a buy order of if the formula φ is satisfiable then there 
is some state with payoff and no fractional unit of the 
security φ is a matching if the formula φ is not satisfiable 
then every state has an auctioneer s payoff of and a single 
unit of the security φ is a matching 
one could argue that if the formula φ is not satisfiable 
then no fully rational buyer would want to buy φ for a cost 
of we can get around this problem by adding auxiliary 
base securities a and b and defining two securities 
τ φ ∧ a ∨ a ∧ b 
τ φ ∧ a ∨ a ∧ b 
with separate buy orders of on each 
if φ were satisfiable then in the state corresponding to 
the satisfying assignment and both a and b to be true τ 
and τ both have an auctioneer s payoff of − so even no 
divisible matching can exist 
if φ were not satisfiable then one unit of each would be a 
matching since in every state at least one of τ or τ are 
false

since ω and s are bounded by a polynomial in n the

to show that matching is np-complete we reduce the 
npcomplete problem exact cover by -sets x c to a 
matching of securities 
the input to x c consists of a set x and a collection c 
of -element subsets of x the input x c is in x c if c 
contains an exact cover of x i e there is a subcollection 
c of c such that every element of x occurs in exactly one 
member of c karp showed that x c is np-complete 
suppose we have an instance x c with the vector x 
 x x q and c c cm 
we set ω e e q r s and define securities labelled 
φ φm ψ ψq and τ as follows 
 security φi is true in state r and is true in state ek 
if k is not in ci 
 security ψj is true only in state s 
 security τ is true in each state ek but not r or s 
we have buy orders on each φi and ψj security for 
 − 
 q 
and a buy order on τ for 
we claim that a matching exists if and only if x c is 
in x c 
if x c is in x c let c be the subcollection that covers 
each element of x exactly once note that c q 
we claim the collection consisting of φi for each ci in

suppose now that x c is not in x c but there is a

 large number of securities with

the class σp 
 is the second level of the polynomial-time 
hierarchy a language l is in σp 
 if there exists a polynomial 
p and a set a in p such that x is in l if and only if there 
is a y with y p x such that for all z with z p x 
 x y z is in a the class σp 
 contains both np and 
conp unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses which 
is considered unlikely a problem that is complete for σp 
 is 
not contained in np or co-np 
we will show that computing a matching is σp 
 -complete 
and remains so even for quite restricted types of securities 
and hence is likely neither in np or co-np while it may 
seem that being np-complete or co-np-complete is hard 
enough there are further practical consequences of being 
outside of np and co-np if the matching problem were in 
np one could use heuristics to search for and verify a match 
if it exists even if such heuristics fail in the worst case they 
may succeed for most examples in practice similarly if 
the matching problem were in co-np one might hope to at 
least heuristically rule out the possibility of matching but 
for problems outside of np or co-np there is no framework 
for verifying that a heuristically derived answer is correct 
less formally for np or co-np -complete problems you 
have to be lucky for σp 
 -complete problems you can t even 
tell if you ve been lucky 
 
we note that the existence of a matching is in σp 
 we 
use y to choose a subset of the orders and z to represent 
a state ω with x y z in a if the set of orders has a total 
nonpositive auctioneer s payoff in state ω 
we prove a stronger theorem which implies that matching 
is in σp 
 let s sn be a set of securities where each 
security si has cost ci and pays off pi whenever formula ci 
is satisfied the − -matching problem asks whether one 
can by accepting either or of each security guarantee a 
worst-case payoff strictly larger than the total cost 
theorem the − -matching problem is σp 
 -complete 
furthermore the problem remains σp 
 -complete under the 
following two special cases 
 for all i ci is a conjunction of base events or their 
negations pi and ci cj for all i and j 
 for all i ci is a conjunction of at most base 
securities or their negations 
these hardness results hold even if there is a promise that 
no subset of the securities guarantees a worst-case payoff 
identical to their cost 
to prove theorem we reduce from the standard σp 
 
problem that we call t∃∀bf given a boolean formula φ 
with variables x xn and y yn is the following 
fullyquantified formula true 
∃x ∃xn∀y ∀yn φ x xn y yn 
the problem remains σp 
 -complete when 
φ x xn y yn 
is restricted to being a disjunction of conjunctions of at most 
 variables or their negations e g 
φ x xn y yn 
 x ∧ ¯x ∧ y ∨ x ∧ y ∧ y ∨ · · · 
this form without the bound on the conjunction size is 
known as disjunctive normal form dnf the restriction to 
conjunctions of variables is -dnf 
we reduce t∃∀bf to finding a matching for the simplest 
reduction we consider the matching problem where one has 
a set of arrow-debreu securities whose payoff events are 
conjunctions of the base securities or their negations the 
auctioneer has the option of accepting either or of each 
of the given securities 
we first reduce to the case where the payoff events are 
conjunctions of arbitrarily many base events or their 
negations by a standard trick we can reduce the number of 
base events in each conjunction to and with a slight twist 
we can even ensure that all securities have the same price as 
well as the same payoff finally we show that the problem 
remains hard even if only conjunctions of variables are 
allowed though with securities that deviate slightly from 
arrow-debreu securities in that they may have varying non 
unit payoffs 
 the basic reduction 
before describing the securities we give some intuition 
the t∃∀bfproblem may be viewed as a game between a 
selector and an adversary the selector sets the xi variables 
and then the adversary sets the yi variables so as to falsify 
the formula φ we can view the − -matching problem as 
one in which the auctioneer is a buyer who buys securities 
corresponding to disjunctions of the base events and then 
the adversary sets the values of the base events to minimize 
the payoff from the securities 
we construct our securities so that the optimal buying 
strategy is to buy n expensive securities along with a set 
of cheap securities of negligible cost for some cases we 
can modify the construction so that all securities have the 
same cost the total cost of the securities will be just 
under and each security pays off so the adversary must 
ensure that none of the securities pays off each expensive 
security forces the adversary to set some variable xi to a 
particular value to prevent the security from paying off this 
corresponds to setting the xi variables in the original game 
the cheap securities are such that preventing every one of 
of these securities from paying off is equivalent to falsifying 
φ in the original game 
among the technical difficulties we face is how to prevent 
the buyer from buying conflicting securities e g one that 
forces xi and the other that forces xi allowing for 
a trivial arbitrage secondly for our analysis we need to 
ensure that a trader cannot spend more to get more say by 
spending for a set of securities with the property that at 
least securities pay off under all possible events 
for each of the variables xi yi in φ we add a 
corresponding base security with the same labels for each 
existential variable xi we add additional base securities ni 
and zi we also include a base security q 
in our basic construction each expensive security costs c 
and each cheap security costs all securities pay off we 
require that cn cheap securities and c n 
that is one can buy n expensive securities and all of the 
cheap securities for less than but one cannot buy n 
expensive securities for less than we at times refer to a 
security by its payoff clause 
remark we may loosely think of as however this 
would allow one to buy a security for nothing that pays in 
the worst case nothing by making we can show 
it hard to distinguish portfolios that guarantee a positive 
profit from those that risk a positive loss setting will 
also allow us to show hardness results for the case where all 
securities have the same cost 
for ≤ i ≤ n we have two expensive securities with 
payoff clauses ¯xi ∧q and ¯ni ∧q and two cheap securities 
with payoff clauses xi ∧ ¯zi and ni ∧ ¯zi 
for each clause c ∈ φ we convert every negated variable 
¯xi into ni and add the conjunction z ∧ · · · ∧ zn thus for a 
clause c x ∧ ¯x ∧ ¯y we construct a cheap security sc 
with payoff clause 
 z ∧ · · · ∧ zn ∧ x ∧ n ∧ ¯y 
finally we have a cheap security with payoff clause ¯q 
we now argue that a matching exists iff 
∃x ∃xn∀y ∀yn φ x xn y yn 
we do this by successively constraining the buyer and the 
adversary eliminating behaviors that would cause the other 
player to win the resulting reasonable strategies 
correspond exactly to the game version of t∃∀bf 
first observe that if the adversary sets all of the base 
securities to false then only the ¯q security will pay off 
 
thus no buyer can buy more than n expensive securities 
and guarantee a profit the problem is thus whether one 
can buy n expensive securities and all the cheap securities 
so that at for any setting of the base events at least one 
security will pay off 
clearly the adversary must make q hold or the ¯q 
security will pay off next we claim that for each i ≤ i ≤ i 
the auctioneer must buy at least one of the ¯xi ∧ q and 
 ¯ni ∧ q securities this follow from the fact that if the 
adversary sets xi ni and zi to be false and every other base 
event to be true then only the ¯xi ∧ q and ¯ni ∧ q 
securities will pay off as no auctioneer can buy more than 
n expensive securities it must therefore buy exactly one of 
 ¯xi ∧ q or ¯ni ∧ q for each i ≤ i ≤ n for the rest 
of the analysis we assume that the auctioneer follows this 
constraint 
suppose that the buyer buys ¯xi ∧q then the adversary 
must set xi to be true since it must set q to be true or the 
security will pay off it must then set zi to be true or xi∧¯zi 
will pay off since the buyer doesn t buy ¯ni ∧ q by the 
above constraint and all the other securities pay the same 
or less when ni is made false we can assume without loss of 
generality that the adversary sets ni to be false similarly 
if the buyer buys ¯ni ∧ q then the adversary must set 
ni and zi to be true and we can assume without loss of 
generality that the adversary sets xi to be false note that 
the adversary must in all cases set each zi event to be true 
summarizing the preceding argument there is an exact 
correspondence between the rational strategies of the buyer 
and settings for the xi variables forced on the adversary 
furthermore the adversary is also constrained to set the 
variables q z zn to be true and without loss of 
generality may be assumed to set ni ¯xi under these 
constraints those securities not corresponding to clauses in φ 
are guaranteed to not pay off 
the adversary also decides the value of the y ym 
base events recall that for each clause c ∈ φ there is a 
corresponding security sc given that zi is true and ni ¯xi 
 without loss of generality it follows from the construction 
of sc that the setting of the yis causes sc to pay off iff it 
satisfies c this establishes the reduction from t∃∀bf to 
the matching problem when the securities are constrained 
to be a conjunction of polynomially many base events or 
their negations 
 reducing to -variable conjunctions 
there are standard methods for reducing dnf formulae to 
 -dnf formulae which are trivially modifiable to our 
securities framework we include the reduction for completeness 
given a security s whose payoff clause is 
c v ∧ v ∧ · · · ∧ vk 
 variable negations are irrelevant to this discussion cost 
c and payoff p introduce a new auxiliary variable w and 
replace the security with two securities s and s with 
payoff clauses 
c v ∧ v ∧ w and 
c ¯w ∧ v ∧ · · · ∧ vk 
the securities both have payoff p and their costs can be 
any positive values that sum to c note that at most one of 
the securities can pay off at a time if only one security is 
bought then the adversary can always set w so that it won t 
pay off hence the auctioneer will buy either both or neither 
for a total cost of c here we use the fact that one is only 
allowed to buy either or shares of each security then 
it may be verified that given the ability to set w arbitrarily 
the adversary can cause c to be unsatisfied iff it can cause 
both c and c to be unsatisfied hence owning one share 
each of s and s is equivalent to owning one share of s 
note that c has three variables and c has k− variables 
by applying the transformation successively one obtains an 
equivalent set of securities of polynomial size whose payoff 
clauses have at most variables 
we note that in the basic construction all of the clauses 
with more than variables are associated with cheap 
securities cost instead of subdividing costs we can simply 
make all of the resulting securities have cost the 
constraints on c and must reflect the new larger number of 
cheap securities 
one can ensure that all of the payoff clauses have exactly 
 variables with a similar construction a security s with 
cost c payoff p and defining clause x ∧ y can be replaced 
by securities s and s with cost c payoff p and defining 
clauses x∧y∧w and x∧y∧ ¯w where w is a new auxiliary 
variable essentially the same analysis as given above 
applies to this case the case of single-variable payoff clauses 
is handled by two applications of this technique 
 reducing to equi-cost securities 
by setting c and appropriately one can ensure that 
in the basic reduction every security costs a polynomially 
bounded integer multiple of call this ratio r we now 
show how to reduce this case to the case where every 
security costs recall that the expensive securities have 
payoff clauses ¯xi ∧ q or ¯ni ∧ q assume that 
security s has payoff clause ¯xi ∧ q the other case is handled 
identically replace s with security s with payoff clause 
 ¯xi ∧ q ∧ w w wr− are auxiliary variables fresh 
variables are chosen for each clause and also s sr− 
with payoff clauses 
 ¯w ∧ w ¯w ∧ w ¯wr− ∧ wr− and ¯wr− ∧ ¯w 
clearly buying none of the new securities is equivalent 
to not buying the original security we show that buying 
all of the new securities is equivalent to buying the original 
security and that buying a proper nonempty subset of the 
securities is irrational 
we first note that if the buyer buys securities s sr− 
then the adversary must set w to be true or one of the 
securities will pay off to see this note that if wi is set to 
false then ¯wi ∧wi will be true unless wi is set to false 
thus setting w to false forces the adversary to set wr− to 
false causing the final clause to be true having set w 
true the adversary can set w wr− to false ensuring 
that none of the securities s sr− pays out if wi is 
true then ¯xi ∧ q ∧ w is equivalent to ¯xi ∧ q so buying 
all of the replacement securities for each is equivalent to 
buying the original security for r 
it remains to show that buying a proper nonempty 
subset of the securities is irrational if one doesn t buy s 
then the adversary can set the w variables so that none of 
s sr− will pay off any money spent on these 
securities is wasted if one doesn t buy sr− the adversary can 
set all w to false in which case none of the new clauses will 
pay off regardless of the value of xi and q similarly if one 
 
doesn t buy si for ≤ i ≤ r − the adversary can set wi 
to be true all the other w variables to be false and again 
there is no payoff regardless of the value of xi and q thus 
buying a proper subset of these securities will not increase 
ones payoff 
we note that this reduction can be combined trivially with 
the reduction that ensures that all of the defining clauses 
have or fewer variables with a slightly messier argument 
all of the defining clauses can be set up to have exactly 
variables 
 reducing to clauses of at most variables 
if we allow securities to have variable payoffs and prices 
we can reduce to the case where each security s payoff clause 
is a conjunction of at most variables or their negations 
given a security s with payoff clause x ∧ y ∧ z cost c 
and payoff we introduce fresh auxiliary variables w w 
and w new variables are used for each clause and replace 
s with the following securities 
 securities s s and s each with cost c and payoff 
 with respective payoff clauses x ∧ w y ∧ w 
and z ∧ w 
 securities s s each with cost and payoff − 
 with payoff clauses 
 w ∧ w w ∧ w w ∧ w 
 ¯w ∧ ¯w ¯w ∧ ¯w ¯w ∧ ¯w 
here is a tiny positive quantity described later by a 
simple case analysis we have the following 
observations 
 for any i there exists a setting of w w an w such 
that of the s securities only si pays off 
 for any setting of w w and w at least one of the 
s securities will pay off 
 if w w and w are all false all of the s securities 
will pay off 
 setting one of w w or w to be true and the others 
to be will cause exactly one of the s securities to 
pay off 
by observation there is no point in buying a nonempty 
proper subset of the s securities the adversary can ensure 
that none of the bought securities will pay off and even if 
all the s securities pay off it will not be sufficient to recoup 
the cost of buying a single s security by observation if 
one buys all the s securities one is guaranteed to almost 
make back ones investment except for in which case by 
observations and the adversaries optimal strategy is to 
make exactly one of w w or w true we set c and 
so that 
cn cheap securities clauses 
thus the accumulated losses of can never spell the 
difference between making a guaranteed profit and making no 
profit at all note also that by making positive we prevent 
the existence of break-even buying strategies in which the 
buyer only purchases s securities 
summarizing the previous argument we may assume 
without loss of generality that the buyer buys all of the s 
securities for all clauses and that for each clause the adversary 
sets exactly one of that clause s auxiliary variables w w or 
w to be true for the rest of the discussion we assume that 
the players follow these constraints 
we next claim that a rational buyer will either buy all 
of s s or s or none of them if the buyer doesn t buy 
s then if the adversary makes w true and w and w 
false neither s nor s will pay off regardless of how the 
adversary sets x y and z hence there is no point in 
buying either s or s if one doesn t buy s applying the 
same argument to s and s establishes the claim 
clearly buying none of s s and s has up to negligible 
 factors the same price payoff behavior as not buying s 
we next argue that subject to the established constraints 
put on the players behaviors buying all of s s and s has 
the same price payoff behavior again ignoring factors as 
buying s regardless of how the adversary sets x y and z 
first in both cases the cost is c if the adversary makes 
x y and z true then s pays off and assuming that 
exactly one of w w and w is true exactly one of s s 
or s will pay off if x is false then s doesn t pay off 
and the adversary can set w true and w and w false 
ensuring that none of s s and s pays off the same 
argument holds if y or z are false 
 tractable cases 
the logical question to ask in light of these complexity 
results is whether further more severe restrictions on the space 
of securities can enable tractable matching algorithms 
although we have not systematically explored the possibilities 
the potential for useful tractable cases certainly exists 
suppose for example that bids are limited to unit 
quantities of securities of the following two forms 
 disjunctions of positive events a ∨ · · · ∨ ak 
 single negative events ¯ai 
let p be the price offered for a disjunction a ∨ · · · ∨ ak 
and qi the maximal price offered for the respective negated 
disjuncts this disjunction bid is part of a match iff p p 
i qi ≥ k evaluating whether this condition is satisfied by 
a subset of bids is quite straightforward 
although this example is contrived its application is not 
entirely implausible for example the disjunctions may 
correspond to insurance customers who want an insurance 
contract to cover all the potential causes of their asset loss the 
atomic securities are sold by insurers each of whom 
specialize in a different form of disaster cause 
 conclusions and 
future directions 
we have analyzed the computational complexity of 
matching for securities based on logical formulas many possible 
avenues for future work exist including 
 analyzing the agents optimization problem 
 how to choose quantities and bid ask prices for 
a collection of securities to maximizes one s 
expected utility both for linear and nonlinear utility 
functions 
 
 how to choose securities that is deciding on 
what collection of boolean formulas to offer to 
trade subject to constraints or penalties on the 
number or complexity of bids 
 how do make the above choices in a game 
theoretically sound way taking into account the choices 
of other traders their reasoning about other traders 
etc 
 although matching is likely intractable are there good 
heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or 
approximate a matching 
 exploring sharing rules for dividing the surplus and 
incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms 
 we may consider a market to be in computational 
equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find 
a strategy that increases utility with few exceptions 
 little is known about computational 
equilibriums a natural question is to determine whether a 
market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is 
not a true equilibrium and under what circumstances 
this may occur
