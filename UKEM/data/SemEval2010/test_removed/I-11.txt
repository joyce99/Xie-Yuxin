abstract 
reasoning about agents that we observe in the world is 
challenging our available information is often limited to observations of 
the agent s external behavior in the past and present to 
understand these actions we need to deduce the agent s internal state 
which includes not only rational elements such as intentions and 
plans but also emotive ones such as fear in addition we often 
want to predict the agent s future actions which are constrained 
not only by these inward characteristics but also by the dynamics 
of the agent s interaction with its environment bee behavior 
evolution and extrapolation uses a faster-than-real-time 
agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents internal 
state by evolution against observed behavior and then predict 
their future behavior taking into account the dynamics of their 
interaction with the environment

 introduction 
reasoning about agents that we observe in the world must 
integrate two disparate levels our observations are often limited 
to the agent s external behavior which can frequently be 
summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time perhaps 
punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary however this 
behavior is driven by the agent s internal state which in the case 
of a human may involve high-level psychological and cognitive 
concepts such as intentions and emotions a central challenge in 
many application domains is reasoning from external observations 
of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state such 
reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agent s behavior 
this problem has traditionally been addressed under the 
rubric of plan recognition or plan inference work to date 
focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state as opposed 
to the emotional state of a single agent as opposed to an 
interacting community and frequently takes advantage of explicit 
communications between agents as in managing conversational 
protocols many realistic problems deviate from these conditions 
increasing the number of agents leads to a combinatorial 
explosion that can swamp conventional analysis 
environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions 
the agents often are trying to hide their intentions and even 
their presence rather than intentionally sharing information 
an agent s emotional state may be at least as important as its 
rational state in determining its behavior 
domains that exhibit these constraints can often be 
characterized as adversarial and include military combat competitive 
business tactics and multi-player computer games 
bee behavioral evolution and extrapolation is a novel 
approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple 
interacting agents based solely on their behavior without recourse 
to intentional communications from them it is inspired by 
techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical 
systems in which a representation of the system is continually fit to 
its recent past behavior for nonlinear dynamical systems the 
representation is a closed-form mathematical equation in bee it is a 
set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents 
representing the individuals being analyzed the current version of 
bee characterizes and predicts the behavior of agents 
representing soldiers engaged in urban combat

 plan recognition in ai 
agent theory commonly describes an agent s cognitive state 
in terms of its beliefs desires and intentions the so-called bdi 
model an agent s beliefs are propositions about the state 
of the world that it considers true based on its perceptions its 
desires are propositions about the world that it would like to be 
true desires are not necessarily consistent with one another an 
agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same 
time an agent s intentions or goals are a subset of its desires 
that it has selected based on its beliefs to guide its future actions 
unlike desires goals must be consistent with one another or at 
least believed to be consistent by the agent 
an agent s goals guide its actions thus one ought to be able 
to learn something about an agent s goals by observing its past 
actions and knowledge of the agent s goals in turn enables 
conclusions about what the agent may do in the future 
this process of reasoning from an agent s actions to its goals 
is known as plan recognition or plan inference this body of 
work surveyed recently at is rich and varied it covers both 
single-agent and multi-agent e g robot soccer team plans 
intentional vs non-intentional actions speech vs non-speech 
behavior adversarial vs cooperative intent complete vs incomplete 
world knowledge and correct vs faulty plans among other 
dimensions 
plan recognition is seldom pursued for its own sake it 
usually supports a higher-level function for example in 
humancomputer interfaces recognizing a user s plan can enable the 
system to provide more appropriate information and options for user 
action in a tutoring system inferring the student s plan is a first 
step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate 
remediation in many cases the higher-level function is predicting 
likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred 
we focus on plan recognition in support of prediction an 
agent s plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future 
behavior but hardly a sufficient one at least two other influences 
one internal and one external need to be taken into account 
the external influence is the dynamics of the environment 
which may include other agents the dynamics of the real world 
impose significant constraints 
the environment may interfere with the desires of the agent 
 
most interactions among agents and between agents and the 
world are nonlinear when iterated these can generate chaos 
 extreme sensitivity to initial conditions 
a rational analysis of an agent s goals may enable us to 
predict what it will attempt but any nontrivial plan with several steps 
will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the 
environment and our prediction must take this reaction into account 
as well actual simulation of futures is one way the only one we 
know now to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on 
an agent s actions 
human agents are also subject to an internal 
influence the agent s emotional state can 
modulate its decision process and its focus of attention 
 and thus its perception of the environment in 
extreme cases emotion can lead an agent to 
choose actions that from the standpoint of a 
logical analysis may appear irrational 
current work on plan recognition for 
prediction focuses on the rational plan and does not 
take into account either external environmental 
influences or internal emotional biases bee 
integrates all three elements into its predictions 
 hidden markov models 
bee is superficially similar to hidden markov models 
 hmm s in both cases the agent has hidden internal state 
 the agent s personality and observable state its outward 
behavior and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable 
state by evolution in bee by the baum-welch algorithm in 
hmm s and then predict the agent s future behavior by 
extrapolation via ghosts in bee by the forward algorithm in hmm s 
bee offers two important benefits over hmm s 
first a single agent s hidden variables do not satisfy the 
markov property that is their values at t depend not only on 
their values at t but also on the hidden variables of other agents 
one could avoid this limitation by constructing a single hmm 
over the joint state space of all of the agents but this approach is 
combinatorially prohibitive bee combines the efficiency of 
independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking 
into account interactions among them 
second markov models assume that transition probabilities 
are stationary this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic 
situations bee s evolutionary process continually updates the agents 
personalities based on actual observations and thus automatically 
accounts for changes in the agents personalities 
 real-time nonlinear systems fitting 
many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real 
numbers that changes as a function of time the dimensions of the 
vector define the system s state space one typically analyzes 
such systems as vector differential equations e g 
 xf 
dt 
xd 
 
when f is nonlinear the system can be formally chaotic and 
starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to 
trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly long-range prediction of 
such a system is impossible however it is often useful to 
anticipate the system s behavior a short distance into the future a 
common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the 
system s trajectory in the recent past then extrapolate this fit into 
the future figure this process is repeated constantly 
providing the user with a limited look-ahead 
this approach is robust and widely applied but requires 
systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical 
equations bee extends this approach to agent behaviors which it fits 
to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm 
 architecture 
bee predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior 
of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained 
agent simulation key elements of the bee 
architecture include the model of an individual 
agent the pheromone infrastructure through 
which agents interact the information sources 
that guide them and the overall evolutionary 
cycle that they execute 
 agent model 
the agents in bee are inspired by two 
bodies of work our previous work on fine-grained 
agents that coordinate their actions through 
digital pheromones in a shared environment 
 and the success of previous 
agentbased combat modeling 
digital pheromones are scalar variables that 
agents deposit and sense at their current location

in the environment agents respond to local concentrations of 
these variables tropistically climbing or descending local 
gradients their movements change the deposit patterns this feedback 
loop together with processes of evaporation and propagation in 
the environment support complex patterns of interaction and 
coordination among the agents table shows the bee s 
current pheromone flavors for example a living member of the 
adversary emits a red-alive pheromone while roads emit a 
mobility pheromone 
our soldier agents are inspired by einstein and mana 
einstein represents an agent as a set of six weights each in 
 - describing the agent s response to six kinds of 
information four of these describe the number of alive friendly alive 
enemy injured friendly and injured enemy troops within the 
agent s sensor range the other two weights relate to the agent s 
distance to its own flag and that of the adversary representing 
objectives that it seeks to protect and attack respectively a 
positive weight indicates attraction to the entity described by the 
weight while a negative weight indicates repulsion 
mana extends the concepts in einstein friendly and 
enemy flags are replaced by the waypoints pursued by each side 
mana includes low medium and high threat enemies in 
addition it defines a set of triggers e g reaching a waypoint being 
shot at making contact with the enemy being injured that shift 
the agent from one personality vector to another a default state 
defines the personality vector when no trigger state is active 
the personality vectors in mana and einstein reflect both 
rational and emotive aspects of decision-making the notion of 
being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in 
various states of health is an important component of what we 
informally think of as emotion e g fear compassion 
aggression and the use of the term personality in both einstein and 
mana suggests that the system designers are thinking 
anthropomorphically though they do not use emotion to describe the 
effect they are trying to achieve the notion of waypoints to 
which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality 
bee uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model 
a bee agent s rationality is a vector of seven desires which 
are values in - protectred the adversary protectblue 
 friendly forces protectgreen civilians protectkeysites 
avoidcombat avoiddetection and survive negative values 
reverse the sense suggested by the label for example a negative 
value of protectred indicates a desire to harm red and an agent 
with a high positive desire to protectred will be attracted to 
redalive red-casualty and mobility pheromone and 
will move at maximum speed 
the emotive component of a bee s personality is based on 
the ortony-clore-collins occ framework and is described 
in detail elsewhere occ define emotions as valanced 
reactions to agents states or events in the environment this notion 
of reaction is captured in mana s trigger states an important 
advance in bee s emotional model is the recognition that agents 
may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers for example 
threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear but a 
given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than 
in a seasoned veteran thus our model includes not only 
emotions but dispositions each emotion has a corresponding 
disposition dispositions are relatively stable and considered constant 
over the time horizon of a run of the bee while emotions vary 
based on the agent s disposition and the stimuli to which it is 
exposed 
interviews with military domain experts identified the two 
most crucial emotions for combat behavior as anger with the 
corresponding disposition irritability and fear whose disposition 
is cowardice table shows which pheromones trigger which 
emotions for example red-casualty pheromone stimulates 
both anger and fear in a red agent but not in a blue agent 
emotions are modeled as agent hormones internal pheromones that 
are augmented in the presence of the triggering environmental 
condition and evaporate over time 
a non-zero emotion modifies the agent s actions elevated 
level anger increases movement likelihood weapon firing 
likelihood and tendency toward an exposed posture elevated fear 
decreases these likelihoods 
figure summarizes the bee s personality model the left 
side is a straightforward bdi model we prefer the term goal to 
intention the right side is the emotive component where an 
appraisal of the agent s beliefs moderated by the disposition 
leads to an emotion that in turn influences the bdi analysis

bee s major innovation is 
extending the nonlinear systems technique of

section describes this process at a high 
level then details the multi-page 
pheromone infrastructure that 
implements it 
 overview 
figure is an overview of 
behavior evolution and extrapolation each 
active entity in the battlespace has an 
persistent avatar that continuously 
generates a stream of ghost agents 
representing itself we call the combined 
modeling entity consisting of avatar and ghosts a polyagent 
ghosts live on a timeline indexed by that begins in the past 
and runs into the future is offset with respect to the current time 
t the timeline is divided into discrete pages each representing 
a successive value of the avatar inserts the ghosts at the 
insertion horizon in our current system the insertion horizon is at - t 
 - meaning that ghosts are inserted into a page representing 
the state of the world minutes ago at the insertion horizon 
each ghost s behavioral parameters desires and dispositions are 
sampled from distributions to explore alternative personalities of 
the entity it represents 
each page between the insertion horizon and t now 
records the historical state of the world at the point in the past to 
which it corresponds as ghosts move from page to page they 
interact with this past state based on their behavioral parameters 
these interactions mean that their fitness depends not just on their 
own actions but also on the behaviors of the rest of the 
population which is also evolving because advances faster than real 
time eventually t actual time at this point each ghost is 
evaluated based on its location compared with the actual location 
of its corresponding real-world entity 
the fittest ghosts have three functions 
 the personality of each entity s fittest ghost is reported to the 
rest of the system as the likely personality of that entity this 
information enables us to characterize individual warriors as 
unusually cowardly or brave 
 the fittest ghosts breed genetically and their offspring return 
to the insertion horizon to continue the fitting process 
 the fittest ghosts for each entity form the basis for a 
population of ghosts that run past the avatar s present into the 
future each ghost that runs into the future explores a 
different possible future of the battle analogous to how some 
people plan ahead by mentally simulating different ways that 
a situation might unfold analysis of the behaviors of these 
different possible futures yields predictions 
thus bee has three distinct notions of time all of which 
may be distinct from real-world time 
 domain time t is the current time in the domain being 
modeled if bee is applied to a real-world situation this time 
is the same as real-world time in our experiments we apply 
bee to a simulated battle and domain time is the time stamp 
published by the simulator during actual runs the simulator 
is often paused so domain time runs slower than real time 
when we replay logs from simulation runs we can speed 
them up so that domain time runs faster 
than real time 
 bee time for a page records the 
domain time corresponding to the state 
of the world represented on that page 
and is offset from the current domain 
time 
 shift time is incremented every time the 
ghosts move from one page to the next 
the relation between shift time and real 
time depends on the processing 
resources available 
 pheromone infrastructure 
bee must operate very rapidly to 
keep pace with the ongoing battle thus 
we use simple agents coordinated using pheromone mechanisms 
we have described the basic dynamics of our pheromone 
infrastructure elsewhere this infrastructure runs on the nodes of a 
graph-structured environment in the case of bee a rectangular 
lattice each node maintains a scalar value for each flavor of 
pheromone and provides three functions 
it aggregates deposits from individual agents fusing 
information across multiple agents and through time 
it evaporates pheromones over time providing an innovative 
alternative to traditional truth maintenance traditionally 
knowledge bases remember everything they are told unless 
they have a reason to forget pheromone-based systems 
immediately begin to forget everything they learn unless it is 
continually reinforced thus inconsistencies automatically 
remove themselves within a known period 
it diffuses pheromones to nearby places disseminating 
information for access by nearby agents 
the distribution of each pheromone flavor over the 
environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the 
world at an instant in time each page of the timeline is a 
complete pheromone field for the world at the bee time represented 
by that page the behavior of the pheromones on each page 
depends on whether the page represents the past or the future

the fittest ghosts run into the future to generate predictions 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
in pages representing the future t the usual pheromone 
mechanisms apply ghosts deposit pheromone each time they 
move to a new page and pheromones evaporate and propagate 
from one page to the next 
in pages representing the past t we have an observed 
state of the real world this has two consequences for pheromone 
management first we can generate the pheromone fields directly 
from the observed locations of individual entities so there is no 
need for the ghosts to make deposits second we can adjust the 
pheromone intensities based on the changed locations of entities 
from page to page so we do not need to evaporate or propagate 
the pheromones both of these simplifications reflect the fact that 
in our current system we have complete knowledge of the past 
when we introduce noise and uncertainty we will probably need 
to introduce dynamic pheromones in the past as well as the future 
execution of the pheromone infrastructure proceeds on two 
time scales running in separate threads 
the first thread updates the book of pages each time the 
domain time advances past the next page boundary at each step 
the former now page is replaced with a new current page 
whose pheromones correspond to the locations and strengths of 
observed units 
an empty page is added at the prediction horizon 
the oldest page is discarded since it has passed the insertion 
horizon 
the second thread moves the ghosts from one page to the 
next as fast as the processor allows at each step 
ghosts reaching the t page are evaluated for fitness and 
removed or evolved 
new ghosts from the avatars and from the evolutionary process 
are inserted at the insertion horizon 
a population of ghosts based on the fittest ghosts are inserted at 
 t to run into the future 
ghosts that have moved beyond the prediction horizon are 
removed 
all ghosts plan their next actions based on the pheromone field 
in the pages they currently occupy 
the system computes the next state of each page including 
executing the actions elected by the ghosts and in future 
pages evaporating pheromones and recording new deposits 
from the recently arrived ghosts 
ghost movement based on pheromone gradients is a simple 
process so this system can support realistic agent populations 
without excessive computer load in our current system each 
avatar generates eight ghosts per shift since there are about 
entities in the battlespace about units each of red and blue and 
about of green we must support about ghosts per page or 
about over the entire book 
how fast a processor do we need let p be the real-time 
duration of a page in seconds if each page represents seconds of 
domain time and we are replaying a simulation at x domain 
time p let n be the number of pages between the insertion 
horizon and t in our current system n then a shift rate 
of n p shifts per second will permit ghosts to run from the 
insertion horizon to the current time at least once before a new page is 
generated empirically this level is a lower bound for reasonable 
performance and easily achievable on stock wintel platforms 
 information sources 
the flexibility of the bee s pheromone infrastructure 
permits the integration of numerous information sources as input to 
our characterizations of entity personalities and predictions of 
their future behavior our current system draws on three sources 
of information but others can readily be added 
real-world observations -observations from the real 
world are encoded into the pheromone field each increment of 
bee time as a new current page is generated table identifies 
the entities that generate each flavor of pheromone 
statistical estimates of threat regions -statistical 
techniques estimate the level of threat to each force red or blue 
based on the topology of the battlefield and the known disposition 
of forces for example a broad open area with no cover is 
threatening especially if the opposite force occupies its margins the 
results of this process are posted to the pheromone pages as 
redthreat pheromone representing a threat to red and 
bluethreat pheromone representing a threat to blue 
ai-based plan recognition -while plan recognition is not 
sufficient for effective prediction it is a valuable input we 
dynamically configure a bayes net based on heuristics to identify 
the likely goals that each entity may hold the destinations of 
these goals function as virtual pheromones ghosts include their 
distance to such points in their action decisions achieving the 
result of gradient following without the computational expense of 
maintaining a pheromone field 
 experimental results 
we have tested bee in a series of experiments in which 
human wargamers make decisions that are played out in a battlefield 
simulator the commander for each side red and blue has at his 
disposal a team of pucksters human operators who set waypoints 
for individual units in the simulator each puckster is responsible 
for four to six units the simulator moves the units determines 
firing actions and resolves the outcome of conflicts it is 
important to emphasize that this simulator is simply a surrogate 
for a sensor feed from a real-world battlefield 
 fitting dispositions 
to test our ability to fit personalities based on behavior one 
red puckster responsible for four units is designated the 
emotional puckster he selects two of his units to be cowardly 
 chickens and two to be irritable rambos he does not 
disclose this assignment during the run he moves each unit 
according to the commander s orders until the unit encounters 
circumstances that would trigger the emotion associated with the unit s 
disposition then he manipulates chickens as though they are 
fearful avoiding combat and moving away from blue and 
moves rambos into combat as quickly as possible our software 
receives position reports on all units every twenty seconds 
 
this process known as sad statistical anomaly detection is 
developed by our colleagues rafael alonso hua li and john 
asmuth at sarnoff corporation alonso and li are now at set

this process known as kip knowledge-based intention 
projection is developed by our colleagues paul nielsen jacob 
crossman and rich frederiksen at soar technology 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the difference between the two disposition values 
 irritability - cowardice of the fittest ghosts proves a better indicator of 
the emotional state of the corresponding entity than either value 
by itself figure shows the delta disposition for each of the eight 
fittest ghosts at each time step plotted against the time in seconds 
for a unit played as a chicken the values clearly trend negative 
figure shows a similar plot for a rambo rambos tend to die 
early and often do not give their ghosts enough time to evolve a 
clear picture of their personality but in 
this case the positive delta disposition is 
evident before the unit s demise 
to characterize a unit s personality 
we maintain a -second exponentially 
weighted moving average of the delta 
disposition and declare the unit to be a 
chicken or rambo if this value passes a 
negative or positive threshold respectively currently this 
threshold is set at we are exploring additional filters for example 
a rapid rate of increase enhances the likelihood of calling a 
rambo units that seek to avoid detection and avoid combat are 
more readily called chicken 
table shows the detection results for emotional units in a 
recent series of experiments we never called a rambo a chicken 
in the one case where we called a chicken a rambo logs show 
that in fact the unit was being played aggressively rushing toward 
oncoming blue forces the brave die young so we almost never 
detect units played intentionally as rambos 
figure shows a comparison on a separate series of 
experiments of our emotion detector compared with humans two 
cowards were played in each of eleven games human observers in 
each game were able to detect a total of of the cowards bee 
was able to detect cowards chickens much earlier than the 
human while missing only one chicken that the humans detected 
in addition to these results on units intentionally played as 
emotional bee sometimes detects other units as cowardly or 
brave analysis of these units shows that these characterizations 
were appropriate units that flee in the face of enemy forces or 
weapons fire are detected as chickens while those that stand their 
ground or rush the adversary are denominated as rambos 
 integrated predictions 
each ghost that runs into the future generates a possible path 
that its unit might follow the paths in the resulting set over all 
ghosts vary in how likely they are the risk they pose to their own 
or the opposite side and so forth in the experiments reported 
here we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance 
from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way 
in this sense it is the most likely future in these experiments we 
receive position reports only on units that have actually come 
within visual range of blue units or on average fewer than half of 
the live red units at any time 
we evaluate predictions spatially comparing an entity s 
actual location with the location predicted 
for it minutes earlier we compare 
bee with two baselines a 
gametheoretic predictor based on linguistic 
geometry and estimates by military 
officers in both cases we use a cep 
 circular error probable measure of 
accuracy the radius of the circle that one 
would have to draw around each prediction to capture of the 
actual unit locations the higher the cep measure the worse the 
accuracy 
figure compares our accuracy with that of the 
gametheoretic predictor each point gives the median cep measure 
over all predictions in a single run points above the diagonal 
favor bee while points below the line favor the game-theoretic 
predictor in all but two missions bee is more accurate in one

 conclusions 
in many domains it is important to reason from an entity s 
observed behavior to an estimate of its internal state and then to 
extrapolate that estimate to predict the entity s future behavior 
bee performs this task using a faster-than-real-time simulation of 
swarming agents coordinated through digital pheromones this 
simulation integrates knowledge of threat regions a cognitive 
analysis of the agent s beliefs desires and intentions a model of 
the agent s emotional disposition and state and the dynamics of 
interactions with the environment by evolving agents in this rich 
environment we can fit their internal state to their observed 
behavior in realistic wargames the system successfully detects 
deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions 
about the entities future behaviors 
bee can only model internal state variables that impact the 
agent s external behavior it cannot fit variables that the agent 
does not manifest externally since the basis for the evolutionary 
cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated 
agent with that of the real entity this limitation is serious if our 
purpose is to understand the entity s internal state for its own 
sake if our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent 
behavior the limitation is much less serious state variables that 
do not impact behavior while invisible to a behavior-based 
analysis are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction 
the bee architecture lends itself to extension in several 
promising directions 
the various inputs being integrated by the bee are only an 
example of the kinds of information that can be handled the 
basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a 
wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as 
well requiring much less additional engineering than other 
more traditional ways of reasoning about how different 
knowledge sources come together in impacting an agent s behavior 
with such a change in inputs bee could be applied more 
widely than its current domain of adversarial reasoning in 
urban warfare potential applications of interest include computer 
games business strategy and sensor fusion 
our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of 
those that have been distinguished by psychologists and that 
might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior we 
expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting 
dispositions that bee can detect 
the mapping between an agent s psychological cognitive and 
emotional state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one 
several different internal states might be consistent with a 
given observed behavior under one set of environmental 
conditions but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions 
if the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such 
distinct internal states we will be unable to distinguish them 
as long as the environment stays in this state our predictions 
will be accurate whichever of the internal states we assign to 
the agent if the environment then shifts to one under which the 
different internal states lead to different behaviors using the 
previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate 
predictions one way to address these concerns is to probe the real 
world perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct 
behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise 
indistinguishable such probing is an important intelligence 
technique bee s faster-than-real-time simulation may enable us to 
identify appropriate probing actions greatly increasing the 
effectiveness of intelligence efforts
