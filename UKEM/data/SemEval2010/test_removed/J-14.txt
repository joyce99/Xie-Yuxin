abstract 
this paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in 
graphical games our approach is based on the data structure called 
the best response policy which was proposed by kearns et al 
as a way to represent all nash equilibria of a graphical game in 
it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as 
long as the underlying graph is a path in this paper we show 
that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best 
response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient 
algorithm which constructs a nash equilibrium that guarantees certain 
payoffs to all participants another attractive solution concept is a 
nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare we show that 
while exactly computing the latter is infeasible we prove that 
solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily 
high degree there exists an fptas for finding such an equilibrium 
as long as the best response policy has polynomial size these two 
algorithms can be combined to produce nash equilibria that satisfy 
various fairness criteria

 introduction 
in a large community of agents an agent s behavior is not likely 
to have a direct effect on most other agents rather it is just the 
agents who are close enough to him that will be affected however 
as these agents respond by adapting their behavior more agents 
will feel the consequences and eventually the choices made by a 
single agent will propagate throughout the entire community 
this is the intuition behind graphical games which were 
introduced by kearns littman and singh in as a compact 
representation scheme for games with many players in an n-player 
graphical game each player is associated with a vertex of an underlying 
graph g and the payoffs of each player depend on his action as 
well as on the actions of his neighbors in the graph if the 
maximum degree of g is δ and each player has two actions available 
to him then the game can be represented using n δ 
numbers 
in contrast we need n n 
numbers to represent a general n-player 
 -action game which is only practical for small values of n for 
graphical games with constant δ the size of the game is linear in n 
one of the most natural problems for a graphical game is that 
of finding a nash equilibrium the existence of which follows from 
nash s celebrated theorem as graphical games are just a special 
case of n-player games the first attempt to tackle this problem 
was made in where the authors consider graphical games with 
two actions per player in which the underlying graph is a 
boundeddegree tree they propose a generic algorithm for finding nash 
equilibria that can be specialized in two ways an exponential-time 
algorithm for finding an exact nash equilibrium and a fully 
polynomial time approximation scheme fptas for finding an 
approximation to a nash equilibrium for any this algorithm 
outputs an -nash equilibrium which is a strategy profile in which 
no player can improve his payoff by more than by unilaterally 
changing his strategy 
while -nash equilibria are often easier to compute than exact 
nash equilibria this solution concept has several drawbacks first 
the players may be sensitive to a small loss in payoffs so the 
strategy profile that is an -nash equilibrium will not be stable this 
will be the case even if there is only a small subset of players who 
are extremely price-sensitive and for a large population of players 
it may be difficult to choose a value of that will satisfy everyone 
second the strategy profiles that are close to being nash equilibria 
may be much better with respect to the properties under 
consideration than exact nash equilibria therefore the approximation to 
the value of the best solution that corresponds to an -nash 
equilibrium may not be indicative of what can be achieved under an 
exact nash equilibrium this is especially important if the purpose 
of the approximate solution is to provide a good benchmark for a 
system of selfish agents as the benchmark implied by an -nash 
equilibrium may be unrealistic for these reasons in this paper we 
focus on the problem of computing exact nash equilibria 
building on ideas of elkind et al showed how to find an 
 exact nash equilibrium in polynomial time when the underlying 
 
graph has degree that is when the graph is a collection of paths 
and cycles by contrast finding a nash equilibrium in a general 
degree-bounded graph appears to be computationally intractable it 
has been shown see to be complete for the complexity 
class ppad extends this hardness result to the case in which 
the underlying graph has bounded pathwidth 
a graphical game may not have a unique nash equilibrium 
indeed it may have exponentially many moreover some nash 
equilibria are more desirable than others rather than having an 
algorithm which merely finds some nash equilibrium we would like to 
have algorithms for finding nash equilibria with various 
sociallydesirable properties such as maximizing overall payoff or 
distributing profit fairly 
a useful property of the data structure of is that it 
simultaneously represents the set of all nash equilibria of the underlying 
game if this representation has polynomial size as is the case for 
paths as shown in one may hope to extract from it a nash 
equilibrium with the desired properties in fact in the authors 
mention that this is indeed possible if one is interested in finding 
an approximate -nash equilibrium the goal of this paper is to 
extend this to exact nash equilibria 
 our results 
in this paper we study n-player -action graphical games on 
bounded-degree trees for which the data structure of has size 
poly n we focus on the problem of finding exact nash equilibria 
with certain socially-desirable properties in particular we show 
how to find a nash equilibrium that nearly maximizes the social 
welfare i e the sum of the players payoffs and we show how 
to find a nash equilibrium that nearly satisfies prescribed payoff 
bounds for all players 
graphical games on bounded-degree trees have a simple 
algebraic structure one attractive feature which follows from is 
that every such game has a nash equilibrium in which the strategy 
of every player is a rational number section studies the algebraic 
structure of those nash equilibria that maximize social welfare we 
show theorems and that surprisingly the set of nash 
equilibria that maximize social welfare is more complex in fact for 
any algebraic number α ∈ with degree at most n we exhibit 
a graphical game on a path of length o n such that in the unique 
social welfare-maximizing nash equilibrium of this game one of 
the players plays the mixed strategy α 
this result shows that it 
may be difficult to represent an optimal nash equilibrium it seems 
to be a novel feature of the setting we consider here that an optimal 
nash equilibrium is hard to represent in a situation where it is easy 
to find and represent a nash equilibrium 
as the social welfare-maximizing nash equilibrium may be hard 
to represent efficiently we have to settle for an approximation 
however the crucial difference between our approach and that of 
previous papers is that we require our algorithm to 
output an exact nash equilibrium though not necessarily the optimal 
one with respect to our criteria in section we describe an 
algorithm that satisfies this requirement namely we propose an 
algorithm that for any finds a nash equilibrium whose total 
payoff is within of optimal it runs in polynomial time theorem 
for any graphical game on a bounded-degree tree for which the data 
structure proposed by the so-called best response policy 
defined below is of size poly n note that as shown in this is 
always the case when the underlying graph is a path more 
pre 
a related result in a different context was obtained by datta 
who shows that n-player -action games are universal in the sense 
that any real algebraic variety can be represented as the set of totally 
mixed nash equilibria of such games 
cisely the running time of our algorithm is polynomial in n pmax 
and where pmax is the maximum absolute value of an entry of 
a payoff matrix i e it is a pseudopolynomial algorithm though it 
is fully polynomial with respect to we show section that 
under some restrictions on the payoff matrices the algorithm can 
be transformed into a truly polynomial-time algorithm that 
outputs a nash equilibrium whose total payoff is within a − factor 
from the optimal 
in section we consider the problem of finding a nash 
equilibrium in which the expected payoff of each player vi exceeds 
a prescribed threshold ti using the idea from section we give 
 theorem a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this 
problem the running time of the algorithm is bounded by a 
polynomial in n pmax and if the instance has a nash equilibrium 
satisfying the prescribed thresholds then the algorithm constructs a 
nash equilibrium in which the expected payoff of each player vi is 
at least ti − 
in section we introduce other natural criteria for selecting 
a good nash equilibrium and we show that the algorithms 
described in the two previous sections can be used as building blocks 
in finding nash equilibria that satisfy these criteria in particular in 
section we show how to find a nash equilibrium that 
approximates the maximum social welfare while guaranteeing that each 
individual payoff is close to a prescribed threshold in section 
we show how to find a nash equilibrium that nearly maximizes 
the minimum individual payoff finally in section we show 
how to find a nash equilibrium in which the individual payoffs of 
the players are close to each other 
 related work 
our approximation scheme theorem and theorem shows 
a contrast between the games that we study and two-player n-action 
games for which the corresponding problems are usually intractable 
for two-player n-action games the problem of finding nash 
equilibria with special properties is typically np-hard in particular this 
is the case for nash equilibria that maximize the social welfare 
 moreover it is likely to be intractable even to approximate such 
equilibria in particular chen deng and teng show that there 
exists some inverse polynomial in n for which computing an 
-nash equilibrium in -player games with n actions per player is 
ppad-complete 
lipton and markakis study the algebraic properties of nash 
equilibria and point out that standard quantifier elimination 
algorithms can be used to solve them note that these algorithms are 
not polynomial-time in general the games we study in this 
paper have polynomial-time computable nash equilibria in which all 
mixed strategies are rational numbers but an optimal nash 
equilibrium may necessarily include mixed strategies with high algebraic 
degree 
a correlated equilibrium ce introduced by aumann is a 
distribution over vectors of players actions with the property that 
if any player is told his own action the value of his own 
component from a vector generated by that distribution then he cannot 
increase his expected payoff by changing his action any nash 
equilibrium is a ce but the converse does not hold in general in 
contrast with nash equilibria correlated equilibria can be found for 
low-degree graphical games as well as other classes of 
conciselyrepresented multiplayer games in polynomial time but for 
graphical games it is np-hard to find a correlated equilibrium that 
maximizes total payoff however the np-hardness results 
apply to more general games than the one we consider here in 
particular the graphs are not trees from it is also known that there 
exist -player -action games for which the expected total payoff 
 
of the best correlated equilibrium is higher than the best nash 
equilibrium and we discuss this issue further in section 
 preliminaries and notation 
we consider graphical games in which the underlying graph g is 
an n-vertex tree in which each vertex has at most δ children each 
vertex has two actions which are denoted by and a mixed 
strategy of a player v is represented as a single number v ∈ 
which denotes the probability that v selects action 
for the purposes of the algorithm the tree is rooted arbitrarily 
for convenience we assume without loss of generality that the root 
has a single child and that its payoff is independent of the action 
chosen by the child this can be achieved by first choosing an 
arbitrary root of the tree and then adding a dummy parent of this 
root giving the new parent a constant payoff function e g 
given an edge v w of the tree g and a mixed strategy w 
for w let g v w w w be the instance obtained from g by 
deleting all nodes z which are separated from v by w i e all 
nodes z such that the path from z to v passes through w and 
 restricting the instance so that w is required to play mixed 
strategy w 
definition suppose that v w is an edge of the tree that 
v is a mixed strategy for v and that w is a mixed strategy for w 
we say that v is a potential best response to w denoted by v ∈ 
pbrv w if there is an equilibrium in the instance g v w w w in 
which v has mixed strategy v we define the best response policy 
for v given w as b w v w v v ∈ pbrv w w ∈ 
 
the upstream pass of the generic algorithm of considers 
every node v other than the root and computes the best response 
policy for v given its parent with the above assumptions about 
the root the downstream pass is straightforward the root selects a 
mixed strategy w for the root w and a mixed strategy v ∈ b w v 
for each child v of w it instructs each child v to play v the 
remainder of the downward pass is recursive when a node v is 
instructed by its parent to adopt mixed strategy v it does the 
following for each child u - it finds a pair v u ∈ b v u with 
the same v value that it was given by its parent and instructs u to 
play u 
the best response policy for a vertex u given its parent v can be 
represented as a union of rectangles where a rectangle is defined 
by a pair of closed intervals iv iu and consists of all points in 
iv × iu it may be the case that one or both of the intervals iv 
and iu consists of a single point in order to perform computations 
on b v u and to bound the number of rectangles used the 
notion of an event point which is defined as follows for any set 
a ⊆ 
that is represented as a union of a finite number of 
rectangles we say that a point u ∈ on the u-axis is a 
uevent point of a if u or u or the representation of a 
contains a rectangle of the form iv × iu and u is an endpoint of 
iu v -event points are defined similarly 
for many games considered in this paper the underlying graph is 
an n-vertex path i e a graph g v e with v v vn 
and e v v vn− vn in it was shown that for 
such games the best response policy has only polynomially-many 
rectangles the proof that the number of rectangles in b vj vj 
is polynomial proceeds by first showing that the number of event 
points in b vj vj cannot exceed the number of event points 
in b vj vj− by more than and using this fact to bound the 
number of rectangles in b vj vj 
let p 
 v and p 
 v be the expected payoffs to v when it 
plays and respectively both p 
 v and p 
 v are multilinear 
functions of the strategies of v s neighbors in what follows we 
will frequently use the following simple observation 
claim for a vertex v with a single child u and parent w 
given any a b c d ∈ q a b c d ∈ q one can select the 
payoffs to v so that p 
 v auw bu cw d p 
 v 
a uw b u c w d moreover if all a b c d a b 
c d are integer the payoffs to v are integer as well 
proof we will give the proof for p 
 v the proof for p 
 v 
is similar for i j let pij be the payoff to v when u 
plays i v plays and w plays j we have p 
 v p − 
u − w p u − w p − u w p uw we have 
to select the values of pij so that p − p − p p a 
−p p b −p p c p d it is easy to 
see that the unique solution is given by p d p c d 
p b d p a b c d 
the input to all algorithms considered in this paper includes the 
payoff matrices for each player we assume that all elements of 
these matrices are integer let pmax be the greatest absolute value 
of any element of any payoff matrix then the input consists of 
at most n δ 
numbers each of which can be represented using 
log pmax bits 
 nash equilibria that maximize 
the social welfare solutions 
in r \ q 
from the point of view of social welfare the best nash 
equilibrium is the one that maximizes the sum of the players expected 
payoffs unfortunately it turns out that computing such a strategy 
profile exactly is not possible in this section we show that even if 
all players payoffs are integers the strategy profile that maximizes 
the total payoff may have irrational coordinates moreover it may 
involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrary degree 
 warm-up quadratic irrationalities 
we start by providing an example of a graphical game on a path 
of length with integer payoffs such that in the nash equilibrium 
that maximizes the total payoff one of the players has a strategy in 
r \ q in the next subsection we will extend this example to 
algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree n to do so we have to consider 
paths of length o n 
theorem there exists an integer-payoff graphical game g 
on a -vertex path uv w such that in any nash equilibrium of g 
that maximizes social welfare the strategy u of the player u and 
the total payoff p satisfy u p ∈ r \ q 
proof the payoffs to the players in g are specified as follows 
the payoff to u is identically i e p 
 u p 
 u using 
claim we select the payoffs to v so that p 
 v −uw w 
and p 
 v p 
 v w u − u where u and w are 
the mixed strategies of u and w respectively it follows that v 
is indifferent between playing and if and only if w f u 
u 
u 
 observe that for any u ∈ we have f u ∈ the 
payoff to w is if it selects the same action as v and otherwise 
claim all nash equilibria of the game g are of the form 
 u f u that is in any nash equilibrium v plays v 
and w plays w f u moreover for any value of u the vector 
of strategies u f u constitutes a nash equilibrium 
proof it is easy to check that for any u ∈ the vector 
 u f u is a nash equilibrium indeed u is content to play 
 
any mixed strategy u no matter what v and w do furthermore 
v is indifferent between and as long as w f u so it can 
play finally if v plays and with equal probability w is 
indifferent between and so it can play f u 
conversely suppose that v then w strictly prefers to 
play i e w then for v we have p 
 v p 
 v − u 
 i e p 
 v p 
 v which implies v a contradiction 
similarly if v player w prefers to play so we have 
w hence p 
 v p 
 v u − u i e 
p 
 v p 
 v which implies v a contradiction finally 
if v but w f u player v is not indifferent between 
and so he would deviate from playing this completes the 
proof of claim 
by claim the total payoff in any nash equilibrium of this game 
is a function of u more specifically the payoff to u is the payoff 
to v is −uf u f u and the payoff to w is therefore 
the nash equilibrium with the maximum total payoff corresponds 
to the value of u that maximizes

this concludes the proof of theorem 
 strategies of arbitrary degree 
we have shown that in the social welfare-maximizing nash 
equilibrium some players strategies can be quadratic irrationalities 
and so can the total payoff in this subsection we will extend this 
result to show that we can construct an integer-payoff graphical 
game on a path whose social welfare-maximizing nash equilibrium 
involves arbitrary algebraic numbers in 
theorem for any degree-n algebraic number α ∈ 
there exists an integer payoff graphical game on a path of length 
o n such that in all social welfare-maximizing nash equilibria 
of this game one of the players plays α 
proof our proof consists of two steps first we construct a 
rational expression r x and a segment x x such that x x ∈ 
q and α is the only maximum of r x on x x second we 
construct a graphical game whose nash equilibria can be 
parameterized by u ∈ x x so that at the equilibrium that corresponds 
to u the total payoff is r u and moreover some player s 
strategy is u it follows that to achieve the payoff-maximizing nash 
equilibrium this player has to play α the details follow 
lemma given an algebraic number α ∈ deg α 
n there exist k k n ∈ q and x x ∈ ∩ q such 
that α is the only maximum of 
r x 
k

 · · · 
k n 
x n 
on x x 
proof let p x be the minimal polynomial of α i e a 
polynomial of degree n with rational coefficients whose leading 
coefficient is such that p α let a α αn be the set of 
all roots of p x consider the polynomial q x −p 
 x it 
has the same roots as p x and moreover for any x ∈ a we have 
q x hence a is the set of all maxima of q x now set 
r x q x 
 x x n x n 
 observe that r x ≤ for all 
x ∈ and r x if and only if q x hence the set 
a is also the set of all maxima of r x on 
let d min αi − α αi ∈ a αi α and set α 
max α − d α min α d clearly α is the 
only zero and hence the only maximum of r x on α α 
let x and x be some rational numbers in α α and α α 
respectively note that by excluding the endpoints of the intervals 
we ensure that x x as x x ⊂ α α we have that 
α is the only maximum of r x on x x 
as r x is a proper rational expression and all roots of its 
denominator are simple by partial fraction decomposition theorem 
r x can be represented as 
r x 
k 
x 
 · · · 
k n 
x n 
 
where k k n are rational numbers 
consider a graphical game on the path 
u− v− u v u v uk− vk− uk 
where k n intuitively we want each triple ui− vi− 
ui to behave similarly to the players u v and w from the game 
described in the previous subsection more precisely we define the 
payoffs to the players in the following way 
 the payoff to u− is no matter what everyone else does 
 the expected payoff to v− is if it plays and u − x − 
x u− −x if it plays where u and u− are the strategies 
of u and u− respectively 
 the expected payoff to v is if it plays and u u − 
u if it plays where u and u are the strategies of u and 
u respectively 
 for each i k − the expected payoff to vi when 
it plays is p 
 vi aiuiui − aiui and the 
expected payoff to vi when it plays is p 
 vi p 
 vi 
ui − ui − where ai −ki and ui and ui are 
the strategies of ui and ui respectively 
 for each i k the payoff to ui does not depend 
on vi and is if ui and vi− select different actions and 
otherwise 
we will now characterize the nash equilibria of this game using a 
sequence of claims 
claim in all nash equilibria of this game v− plays 
and the strategies of u− and u satisfy u x − x u− x 
consequently in all nash equilibria we have u ∈ x x 
 
proof the proof is similar to that of claim let f u− 
 x − x u− x clearly the player v− is indifferent between 
playing and if and only if u f u− suppose that v− 
 then u strictly prefers to play i e u so we have 
p 
 v− p 
 v− − x − x u− − x 
as 
 − x ≤ − x − x u− − x ≤ − x 
for u− ∈ and x we have p 
 v− p 
 v− so 
v− prefers to play a contradiction similarly if v− the 
player u strictly prefers to play i e u so we have 
p 
 v− p 
 v− − x − x u− − x 
as x x x we have p 
 v− p 
 v− so v− 
prefers to play a contradiction finally if v− plays but 
u f u− player v− is not indifferent between and so he 
would deviate from playing 
also note that f x f x and moreover f u− ∈ 
 x x if and only if u− ∈ hence in all nash equilibria of 
this game we have u ∈ x x 
claim in all nash equilibria of this game for each i 
 k − we have vi and the strategies of the 
players ui and ui satisfy ui fi ui where f u u u 
and fi u − u for i 
proof the proof of this claim is also similar to that of claim 
we use induction on i to prove that the statement of the claim is true 
and additionally ui for i 
for the base case i note that u by the previous claim 
 recall that x x are selected so that x x and consider 
the triple u v u let v be the strategy of v first suppose 
that v then u strictly prefers to play i e u 
then for v we have p 
 v p 
 v − u as u we 
have p 
 v p 
 v which implies v a contradiction 
similarly if v player u prefers to play so we have 
u hence p 
 v p 
 v it follows that p 
 v 
p 
 v which implies v a contradiction finally if v 
 but u u u player v is not indifferent between 
and so he would deviate from playing moreover as u 
u u and u ∈ we have u 
the argument for the inductive step is similar namely suppose 
that the statement is proved for all i i and consider the triple 
 ui vi ui 
let vi be the strategy of vi first suppose that vi then 
ui strictly prefers to play i e ui then for vi we 
have p 
 vi p 
 vi − i e p 
 vi p 
 vi which implies 
vi a contradiction similarly if vi player ui prefers 
to play so we have ui hence p 
 vi p 
 vi 
 − ui by inductive hypothesis we have ui consequently 
p 
 vi p 
 vi which implies vi a contradiction finally 
if vi but ui − ui player vi is not indifferent 
between and so he would deviate from playing moreover 
as ui − ui and ui we have ui 
claim any strategy profile of the form 
 u− u u uk− uk 
where u− ∈ u x − x u− x u u u 
and ui − ui for i ≥ constitutes a nash equilibrium 
proof first the player u− s payoffs do not depend on other 
players actions so he is free to play any strategy in as long 
as u x −x u− x player v− is indifferent between and 
 so he is content to play a similar argument applies to players 
v vk− finally for each i k the payoffs of player 
ui only depend on the strategy of player vi− in particular as 
long as vi− player ui is indifferent between playing and 
 so he can play any mixed strategy ui ∈ to complete the 
proof note that x − x u− x ∈ for all u− ∈ 
u u ∈ for all u ∈ and − ui ∈ 
for all ui ∈ so we have ui ∈ for all i k 
now let us compute the total payoff under a strategy profile of 
the form given in claim the payoff to u− is and the 
expected payoff to each of the ui i k is the expected 
payoffs to v− and v are finally for any i k − 
the expected payoff to vi is ti aiuiui − aiui it 
follows that to find a nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff 
we have to maximize 
pk− 
i ti subject to conditions u− ∈ 
u x −x u− x u u u and ui −ui 
for i k − 
we would like to express 
pk− 
i ti as a function of u to 
simplify notation set u u 
lemma for i k we have ui u i− 
u i 
 
proof the proof is by induction on i for i we have 
u u u now for i ≥ suppose that ui− u i − 
 u i − we have ui − ui− u i − u 
 i − − u − i u i − u i 
it follows that for i k − we have 
ti ai 
u i − 
u i 
u i 
u i 
− ai 
u i 
u i 
 
−ai 
 
u i 
 
ki 
u i 
 
observe that as u− varies from to u varies from x to x 
therefore to maximize the total payoff we have to choose u ∈ 
 x x so as to maximize 
k 
u 
 · · · 
kk 
u k 
 r u 
by construction the only maximum of r u on x x is α it 
follows that in the payoff-maximizing nash equilibrium of our game 
u plays α 
finally note that the payoffs in our game are rational rather than 
integer however it is easy to see that we can multiply all payoffs 
to a player by their greatest common denominator without affecting 
his strategy in the resulting game all payoffs are integer this 
concludes the proof of theorem 
 approximating the socially 
optimal nash equilibrium 
we have seen that the nash equilibrium that maximizes the 
social welfare may involve strategies that are not in q hence in this 
section we focus on finding a nash equilibrium that is almost 
optimal from the social welfare perspective we propose an algorithm 
that for any finds a nash equilibrium whose total payoff 
is within from optimal the running time of this algorithm is 
polynomial in n and pmax recall that pmax is the maximum 
absolute value of an entry of a payoff matrix 
while the negative result of the previous section is for graphical 
games on paths our algorithm applies to a wider range of 
scenarios namely it runs in polynomial time on bounded-degree trees 
 
as long as the best response policy of each vertex given its parent 
can be represented as a union of a polynomial number of 
rectangles note that path graphs always satisfy this condition in we 
showed how to compute such a representation given a graph with 
maximum degree consequently for path graphs the running time 
of our algorithm is guaranteed to be polynomial note that 
exhibits a family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees for 
which the best response policies of some of the vertices given their 
parents have exponential size when represented as unions of 
rectangles 
due to space restrictions in this version of the paper we present 
the algorithm for the case where the graph underlying the graphical 
game is a path we then state our result for the general case the 
proof can be found in the full version of this paper 
suppose that s is a strategy profile for a graphical game g that 
is s assigns a mixed strategy to each vertex of g let epv s 
be the expected payoff of player v under s and let ep s p 
v epv s let 
m g max ep s s is a nash equilibrium for g

proof let v vn be the set of all players we start by 
constructing the best response policies for all vi i n − 
as shown in this can be done in time o n 
 
let n n be a parameter to be selected later set δ n 
and define x jδ j n we say that vj is an event 
point for a player vi if it is a vi-event point for b vi vi− or 
b vi vi for each player vi consider a finite set of strategies 
xi given by 
xi x ∪ vj vj is an event point for vi 
it has been shown in that for any i n the best response 
policy b vi vi− has at most n vi-event points as we 
require n n we have xi ≤ n assume without loss of 
generality that xi n order the elements of xi in increasing 
order as x 
i x 
i · · · x n 
i we will refer to the strategies 
in xi as discrete strategies of player vi a strategy profile in which 
each player has a discrete strategy will be referred to as a discrete 
strategy profile 
we will now show that even we restrict each player vi to 
strategies from xi the players can still achieve a nash equilibrium and 
moreover the best such nash equilibrium with respect to the 
social welfare has total payoff at least m g − as long as n is 
large enough 
let s be a strategy profile that maximizes social welfare that is 
let s s sn where si is the mixed strategy of player vi and 
ep s m g for i n let ti max xj 
i xj 
i ≤ si 
first we will show that the strategy profile t t tn is a 
nash equilibrium for g 
fix any i i ≤ n and let r v v × u u be the 
rectangle in b vi vi− that contains si si− as v is a vi-event 
point of b vi vi− we have v ≤ ti so the point ti si− is 
inside r similarly the point u is a vi− -event point of b vi vi− 
so we have u ≤ ti− and therefore the point ti ti− is inside r 
this means that for any i i ≤ n we have ti− ∈ pbrvi− 
 ti 
which implies that t t tn is a nash equilibrium for g 
now let us estimate the expected loss in social welfare caused 
by playing t instead of s 
lemma for any pair of strategy profiles t s such that ti − 
si ≤ δ we have epvi s − epvi t ≤ pmaxδ for any i

lemma implies 
pn 
i epvi s − epvi t ≤ npmaxδ 
so by choosing δ npmax or equivalently setting n 
 npmax we can ensure that the total expected payoff for the 
strategy profile t is within from optimal 
we will now show that we can find the best discrete nash 
equilibrium with respect to the social welfare using dynamic 
programming as t is a discrete strategy profile this means that the strategy 
profile found by our algorithm will be at least as good as t 
define ml k 
i to be the maximum total payoff that v vi− 
can achieve if each vj j ≤ i chooses a strategy from xj for each 
j i the strategy of vj is a potential best response to the strategy 
of vj and moreover vi− plays xl 
i− vi plays xk 
i if there is 
no way to choose the strategies for v vi− to satisfy these 
conditions we set ml k 
i −∞ the values ml k 
i i n 
k l n can be computed inductively as follows 
we have ml k 
 for k l n now suppose that we 
have already computed ml k 
j for all j i k l n to 
compute mk l 
i we first check if xk 
i xl 
i− ∈ b vi vi− if this 
is not the case we have ml k 
i −∞ otherwise consider the set 
y xi− ∩ pbrvi− 
 xl 
i− i e the set of all discrete strategies 
of vi− that are potential best responses to xl 
i− the proof of 
theorem in implies that the set pbrvi− 
 xl 
i− is non-empty 
the player vi− has a potential best response to any strategy of 
vi− in particular xl 
i− by construction of the set xi− this 
implies that y is not empty for each xj 
i− ∈ y let pjlk be the 
payoff that vi− receives when vi− plays xj 
i− vi− plays xl 
i− 
and vi plays xk 
i clearly pjlk can be computed in constant time 
then we have ml k 
i max mj l 
i− pjlk xj 
i− ∈ y 
finally suppose that we have computed ml k 
n for l k n 
we still need to take into account the payoff of player vn hence 
 
we consider all pairs xk 
n xl 
n− that satisfy xl 
n− ∈ pbrvn− 
 xk 
n 
and pick the one that maximizes the sum of mk l 
n and the payoff of 
vn when he plays xk 
n and vn− plays xl 
n− this results in the 
maximum total payoff the players can achieve in a nash 
equilibrium using discrete strategies the actual strategy profile that 
produces this payoff can be reconstructed using standard dynamic 
programming techniques 
it is easy to see that each ml k 
i can be computed in time o n 
i e all of them can be computed in time o nn 
 recall that 
we have to select n ≥ npmax to ensure that the strategy 
profile we output has total payoff that is within from optimal we 
conclude that we can compute an -approximation to the best nash 
equilibrium in time o n

 this completes the proof of 
theorem 
to state our result for the general case i e when the underlying 
graph is a bounded-degree tree rather than a path we need 
additional notation if g has n players let q n be an upper bound 
on the number of event points in the representation of any best 
response policy that is we assume that for any vertex u with 
parent v b v u has at most q n event points we will be 
interested in the situation in which q n is polynomial in n 
theorem let g be an n-player graphical game on a tree 
in which each node has at most δ children suppose we are given a 
set of best-response policies for g in which each best-response 
policy b v u is represented by a set of rectangles with at most q n 
event points for any there is an algorithm that constructs a 
nash equilibrium s for g that satisfies ep s ≥ m g − the 
running time of the algorithm is polynomial in n pmax and − 
provided that the tree has bounded degree that is δ o and 
q n is a polynomial in n in particular if 
n max δ q n n δ 
 δ pmax 
− 
 
and δ then the running time is o nδ n δ 
 
for the proof of this theorem see 
 a polynomial-time algorithm for 
multiplicative approximation 
the running time of our algorithm is pseudopolynomial rather 
than polynomial because it includes a factor which is polynomial 
in pmax the maximum in absolute value entry in any payoff 
matrix if we are interested in multiplicative approximation rather than 
additive one this can be improved to polynomial 
first note that we cannot expect a multiplicative 
approximation for all inputs that is we cannot hope to have an algorithm 
that computes a nash equilibrium with total payoff at least − 
 m g if we had such an algorithm then for graphical games 
g with m g the algorithm would be required to output 
the optimal solution to show that this is infeasible observe that 
we can use the techniques of section to construct two 
integercoefficient graphical games on paths of length o n such that for 
some x ∈ r the maximal total payoff in the first game is x 
the maximal total payoff in the second game is −x and for both 
games the strategy profiles that achieve the maximal total payoffs 
involve algebraic numbers of degree n by combining the two 
games so that the first vertex of the second game becomes 
connected to the last vertex of the first game but the payoffs of all 
players do not change we obtain a graphical game in which the 
best nash equilibrium has total payoff yet the strategies that lead 
to this payoff have high algebraic complexity 
however we can achieve a multiplicative approximation when 
all entries of the payoff matrices are positive and the ratio between 
any two entries is polynomially bounded recall that we assume 
that all payoffs are integer and let pmin be the smallest entry 
of any payoff matrix in this case for any strategy profile the payoff 
to player i is at least pmin so the total payoff in the social-welfare 
maximizing nash equilibrium s satisfies m g ≥ npmin 
moreover lemma implies that by choosing δ pmax pmin 
we can ensure that the nash equilibrium t produced by our 
algorithm satisfies 
nx 
i 
epvi s − 
nx 
i 
epvi t ≤ pmaxδn ≤ npmin ≤ m g 
i e for this value of δ we have 
pn 
i epvi t ≥ − m g 
recall that the running time of our algorithm is o nn 
 where n 
has to be selected to satisfy n n n δ it follows that if 
pmin pmax pmin poly n we can choose n so that our 
algorithm provides a multiplicative approximation guarantee and 
runs in time polynomial in n and 
 bounded payoff nash equilibria 
another natural way to define what is a good nash equilibrium 
is to require that each player s expected payoff exceeds a certain 
threshold these thresholds do not have to be the same for all 
players in this case in addition to the payoff matrices of the n players 
we are given n numbers t tn and our goal is to find a nash 
equilibrium in which the payoff of player i is at least ti or report 
that no such nash equilibrium exists it turns out that we can 
design an fptas for this problem using the same techniques as in the 
previous section 
theorem given a graphical game g on an n-vertex path 
and n rational numbers t tn suppose that there exists a 
strategy profile s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and 
epvi s ≥ ti for i n then for any we can 
find in time o max np 
max 
 n 
 
 a strategy profile s such 
that s is a nash equilibrium for g and epvi s ≥ ti − for 
i n 
proof the proof is similar to that of theorem first we 
construct the best response policies for all players choose n n 
and construct the sets xi i n as described in the proof 
of theorem 
consider a strategy profile s such that s is a nash equilibrium 
for g and epvi s ≥ ti for i n we construct a 
strategy profile ti max xj 
i xj 
i ≤ si and use the same 
argument as in the proof of theorem to show that t is a nash 
equilibrium for g by lemma we have epvi s − epvi t ≤ 
 pmaxδ so choosing δ pmax or equivalently n 
max n pmax we can ensure epvi t ≥ ti − for i 
 n 
now we will use dynamic programming to find a discrete nash 
equilibrium that satisfies epvi t ≥ ti − for i n as t 
is a discrete strategy profile our algorithm will succeed whenever 
there is a strategy profile s with epvi s ≥ ti− for i n 
let zl k 
i if there is a discrete strategy profile such that for any 
j i the strategy of the player vj is a potential best response to the 
strategy of vj the expected payoff of vj is at least tj − and 
moreover vi− plays xl 
i− vi plays xk 
i otherwise let zl k 
i 
we can compute zl k 
i i n k l n inductively 
as follows 
we have zl k 
 for k l n now suppose that we 
have already computed zl k 
j for all j i k l n to 
compute zk l 
i we first check if xk 
i xl 
i− ∈ b vi vi− if this 
 
is not the case clearly zk l 
i otherwise consider the set y 
xi− ∩pbrvi− 
 xl 
i− i e the set of all discrete strategies of vi− 
that are potential best responses to xl 
i− it has been shown in the 
proof of theorem that y ∅ for each xj 
i− ∈ y let pjlk be the 
payoff that vi− receives when vi− plays xj 
i− vi− plays xl 
i− 
and vi plays xk 
i clearly pjlk can be computed in constant time if 
there exists an xj 
i− ∈ y such that zj l 
i− and pjlk ≥ ti− − 
set zl k 
i otherwise set zl k 
i 
having computed zl k 
n l k n we check if zl k 
n 
 for some pair l k if such a pair of indices exists we 
instruct vn to play xk 
n and use dynamic programming techniques 
 or equivalently the downstream pass of the algorithm of 
to find a nash equilibrium s that satisfies epvi s ≥ ti − for 
i n recall that vn is a dummy player i e we assume 
tn epn s for any choice of s if zl k 
n for all 
l k n there is no discrete nash equilibrium s that 
satisfies epvi s ≥ ti − for i n and hence no nash 
equilibrium s not necessarily discrete such that epvi s ≥ ti 
for i n 
the running time analysis is similar to that for theorem we 
conclude that the running time of our algorithm is o nn 
 
o max np 
max 
 n 
 
 
remark theorem can be extended to trees of bounded 
degree in the same way as theorem 
 exact computation 
another approach to finding nash equilibria with bounded 
payoffs is based on inductively computing the subsets of the best 
response policies of all players so as to exclude the points that do 
not provide sufficient payoffs to some of the players formally we 
say that a strategy v of the player v is a potential best response 
to a strategy w of its parent w with respect to a threshold vector 
t t tn denoted by v ∈ pbrv w t if there is an 
equilibrium in the instance g v w w w in which v plays mixed 
strategy v and the payoff to any player vi downstream of v 
 including v is at least ti the best response policy for v with respect 
to a threshold vector t is defined as b w v t w v v ∈ 
pbrv w t w ∈ 
it is easy to see that if any of the sets b vj vj− t j 
 n is empty it means that it is impossible to provide all 
players with expected payoffs prescribed by t otherwise one 
can apply the downstream pass of the original algorithm of to 
find a nash equilibrium as we assume that vn is a dummy 
vertex whose payoff is identically the nash equilibrium with these 
payoffs exists as long as tn ≤ and b vn vn− t is not empty 
using the techniques developed in it is not hard to show that 
for any j n the set b vj vj− t consists of a finite 
number of rectangles and one can compute b vj vj t given 
b vj vj− t the advantage of this approach is that it allows 
us to represent all nash equilibria that provide required payoffs 
to the players however it is not likely to be practical since it 
turns out that the rectangles that appear in the representation of 
b vj vj− t may have irrational coordinates 
claim there exists a graphical game g on a -vertex path 
uv w and a vector t t t t such that b v w t 
cannot be represented as a union of a finite number of rectangles with 
rational coordinates 
proof we define the payoffs to the players in g as follows 
the payoff to u is identically i e p 
 u p 
 u 
using claim we select the payoffs to v so that p 
 v uw 
p 
 v p 
 v w − u − where u and w are the mixed 
strategies of u and w respectively it follows that v is indifferent 
between playing and if and only if w f u u 
observe that for any u ∈ we have f u ∈ it is not hard 
to see that we have 
b w v × ∪ × ∪ × 
the payoffs to w are not important for our construction for 
example set p w p w 
now set t i e we are interested in nash 
equilibria in which v s expected payoff is at least suppose w ∈ 
 the player v can play a mixed strategy v when w is 
playing w as long as u plays u f− 
 w w − to ensure 
that v is indifferent between and and p 
 v p 
 v 
uw w w − ≥ the latter condition is satisfied if 
w ≤ − 
√ 
 or w ≥ 
√ 
 note that we 
have 
√ 
 for any other value of w any 
strategy of u either makes v prefer one of the pure strategies or 
does not provide it with a sufficient expected payoff there are also 
some values of w for which v can play a pure strategy or 
as a potential best response to w and guarantee itself an expected 
payoff of at least it can be shown that these values of w form 
a finite number of segments in we conclude that any 
representation of b w v t as a union of a finite number of rectangles 
must contain a rectangle of the form 
√ 
 w × v v 
for some w v v ∈ 
on the other hand it can be shown that for any integer payoff 
matrices and threshold vectors and any j n − the sets 
b vj vj t contain no rectangles of the form u u × v or 
 v × w w where v ∈ r\q this means that if b vn vn− t 
is non-empty i e there is a nash equilibrium with payoffs 
prescribed by t then the downstream pass of the algorithm of 
can always pick a strategy profile that forms a nash equilibrium 
provides a payoff of at least ti to the player vi and has no 
irrational coordinates hence unlike in the case of the nash 
equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare working with irrational 
numbers is not necessary and the fact that the algorithm discussed 
in this section has to do so can be seen as an argument against using 
this approach 
 other criteria for selecting a 
nash equilibrium 
in this section we consider several other criteria that can be 
useful in selecting a nash equilibrium 
 combining welfare maximization with 
bounds on payoffs 
in many real life scenarios we want to maximize the social 
welfare subject to certain restrictions on the payoffs to individual 
players for example we may want to ensure that no player gets a 
negative expected payoff or that the expected payoff to player i is 
at least pi 
max − ξ where pi 
max is the maximum entry of i s 
payoff matrix and ξ is a fixed parameter formally given a graphical 
game g and a vector t tn let s be the set of all nash 
equilibria s of g that satisfy ti ≤ epvi s for i n and let 
ˆs argmaxs∈s ep s 
if the set s is non-empty we can find a nash equilibrium ˆs that 
is -close to satisfying the payoff bounds and is within from ˆs with 
respect to the total payoff by combining the algorithms of section 
and section 
namely for a given choose δ as in the proof of theorem 
and let xi be the set of all discrete strategies of player vi for a 
 
formal definition see the proof of theorem combining the 
proofs of theorem and theorem we can see that the strategy 
profile ˆt given by ˆti max xj 
i xj 
i ≤ ˆsi satisfies epvi ˆt ≥ 
ti − ep ˆs − ep ˆt ≤ 
define ˆml k 
i to be the maximum total payoff that v vi− 
can achieve if each vj j ≤ i chooses a strategy from xj for each 
j i the strategy of vj is a potential best response to the strategy 
of vj and the payoff to player vj is at least tj − and 
moreover vi− plays xl 
i− vi plays xk 
i if there is no way to choose 
the strategies for v vi− to satisfy these conditions we set 
ml k 
i −∞ the ˆml k 
i can be computed by dynamic 
programming similarly to the ml k 
i and zl k 
i in the proofs of theorems 
and finally as in the proof of theorem we use ml k 
n to select 
the best discrete nash equilibrium subject to the payoff constraints 
even more generally we may want to maximize the total payoff 
to a subset of players who are assumed to be able to redistribute 
the profits fairly among themselves while guaranteeing certain 
expected payoffs to a subset of the other players this problem can 
be handled similarly 
 a minimax approach 
a more egalitarian measure of the quality of a nash equilibrium 
is the minimal expected payoff to a player the optimal solution 
with respect to this measure is a nash equilibrium in which the 
minimal expected payoff to a player is maximal to find an 
approximation to such a nash equilibrium we can combine the 
algorithm of section with binary search on the space of potential 
lower bounds note that the expected payoff to any player vi given 
a strategy s always satisfies −pmax ≤ epvi s ≤ pmax 
for a fixed we start by setting t −pmax t pmax 
t 
 t t we then run the algorithm of section with 
t · · · tn t 
 if the algorithm succeeds in finding a 
nash equilibrium s that satisfies epvi s ≥ t 
− for all i 
 n we set t t 
 t 
 t t otherwise we set 
t t 
 t 
 t t and loop we repeat this process 
until t − t ≤ it is not hard to check that for any p ∈ r 
if there is a nash equilibrium s such that mini n epvi s ≥ 
p then our algorithm outputs a nash equilibrium s that satisfies 
mini n epvi s ≥ p− the running time of our algorithm 
is o max np 
max log − 
 
 n 
log − 
 
 
 equalizing the payoffs 
when the players payoff matrices are not very different it is 
reasonable to demand that the expected payoffs to the players do 
not differ by much either we will now show that nash equilibria 
in this category can be approximated in polynomial time as well 
indeed observe that the algorithm of section can be easily 
modified to deal with upper bounds on individual payoffs rather 
than lower bounds moreover we can efficiently compute an 
approximation to a nash equilibrium that satisfies both the upper 
bound and the lower bound for each player more precisely 
suppose that we are given a graphical game g n rational numbers 
t tn t tn and then if there exists a 
strategy profile s such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and ti ≤ 
epvi s ≤ ti for i n we can find a strategy profile s 
such that s is a nash equilibrium for g and ti − ≤ epvi s ≤ 
ti for i n the modified algorithm also runs in time 
o max np 
max 
 n 
 
 
this observation allows us to approximate nash equilibria in 
which all players expected payoffs differ by at most ξ for any fixed 
ξ given an we set t · · · tn −pmax 
t · · · tn −pmax ξ and run the modified version 
of the algorithm of section if it fails to find a solution we 
increment all ti ti by and loop we continue until the algorithm 
finds a solution or ti ≥ pmax 
suppose that there exists a nash equilibrium s that satisfies 
 epvi s − epvj s ≤ ξ for all i j n set r 
mini n epvi s we have r ≤ epvi s ≤ r ξ for all 
i n there exists a k ≥ such that −pmax k − ≤ 
r ≤ −pmax k during the kth step of the algorithm we set 
t · · · tn −pmax k− i e we have r− ≤ ti ≤ r 
r ξ ≤ ti ≤ r ξ that is the nash equilibrium s satisfies 
ti ≤ r ≤ epvi s ≤ r ξ ≤ ti which means that when ti is 
set to −pmax k − our algorithm is guaranteed to output a 
nash equilibrium t that satisfies r − ≤ ti − ≤ epvi t ≤ 
ti ≤ r ξ we conclude that whenever such a nash 
equilibrium s exists our algorithm outputs a nash equilibrium t that 
satisfies epvi t − epvj t ≤ ξ for all i j n 
the running time of this algorithm is o max np 
max 
 n 
 
 
note also that we can find the smallest ξ for which such a nash 
equilibrium exists by combining this algorithm with binary search 
over the space ξ pmax this identifies an approximation 
to the fairest nash equilibrium i e one in which the players 
expected payoffs differ by the smallest possible amount 
finally note that all results in this section can be extended to 
bounded-degree trees 
 conclusions 
we have studied the problem of equilibrium selection in 
graphical games on bounded-degree trees we considered several criteria 
for selecting a nash equilibrium such as maximizing the social 
welfare ensuring a lower bound on the expected payoff of each 
player etc first we focused on the algebraic complexity of a 
social welfare-maximizing nash equilibrium and proved strong 
negative results for that problem namely we showed that even for 
graphical games on paths any algebraic number α ∈ may 
be the only strategy available to some player in all social 
welfaremaximizing nash equilibria this is in sharp contrast with the fact 
that graphical games on trees always possess a nash equilibrium in 
which all players strategies are rational numbers 
we then provided approximation algorithms for selecting nash 
equilibria with special properties while the problem of finding 
approximate nash equilibria for various classes of games has 
received a lot of attention in recent years most of the existing work 
aims to find -nash equilibria that satisfy or are -close to 
satisfying certain properties our approach is different in that we insist 
on outputting an exact nash equilibrium which is -close to 
satisfying a given requirement as argued in the introduction there are 
several reasons to prefer a solution that constitutes an exact nash 
equilibrium 
our algorithms are fully polynomial time approximation schemes 
i e their running time is polynomial in the inverse of the 
approximation parameter though they may be pseudopolynomial with 
respect to the input size under mild restrictions on the inputs they 
can be modified to be truly polynomial this is the strongest 
positive result one can derive for a problem whose exact solutions may 
be hard to represent as is the case for many of the problems 
considered here while we prove our results for games on a path they can 
be generalized to any tree for which the best response policies have 
compact representations as unions of rectangles in the full version 
of the paper we describe our algorithms for the general case 
further work in this vein could include extensions to the kinds 
of guarantees sought for nash equilibria such as guaranteeing total 
payoffs for subsets of players selecting equilibria in which some 
players are receiving significantly higher payoffs than their peers 
etc at the moment however it is perhaps more important to 
inves 
tigate whether nash equilibria of graphical games can be computed 
in a decentralized manner in contrast to the algorithms we have 
introduced here 
it is natural to ask if our results or those of can be generalized 
to games with three or more actions however it seems that this 
will make the analysis significantly more difficult in particular 
note that one can view the bounded payoff games as a very limited 
special case of games with three actions per player namely given 
a two-action game with payoff bounds consider a game in which 
each player vi has a third action that guarantees him a payoff of 
ti no matter what everyone else does then checking if there is 
a nash equilibrium in which none of the players assigns a 
nonzero probability to his third action is equivalent to checking if there 
exists a nash equilibrium that satisfies the payoff bounds in the 
original game and section shows that finding an exact solution 
to this problem requires new ideas 
alternatively it may be interesting to look for similar results in 
the context of correlated equilibria ce especially since the best 
ce may have higher value total expected payoff than the best ne 
the ratio between these values is called the mediation value in 
it is known from that the mediation value of -player -action 
games with non-negative payoffs is at most 
 
 and they exhibit a 
 -player game for which it is infinite furthermore a -player 
 action example from also has infinite mediation value
