 introduction 
security communication is an important requirement in many 
sensor network applications so shared secret keys are used 
between communicating nodes to encrypt data as one of the 
most fundamental security services pairwise key establishment 
enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other 
using cryptographic techniques however due to the sensor 
nodes limited computational capabilities battery energy and 
available memory it is not feasible for them to use traditional 
pairwise key establishment techniques such as public key 
cryptography and key distribution center kdc several 
alternative approaches have been developed recently to perform 
pairwise key establishment on resource-constrained sensor 
networks without involving the use of traditional cryptography 
 
eschenauer and gligor proposed a basic probabilistic key 
predistribution scheme for pairwise key establishment in the 
scheme each sensor node randomly picks a set of keys from a key 
pool before the deployment so that any two of the sensor nodes 
have a certain probability to share at least one common key chan 
et al further extended this idea and presented two key 
predistribution schemes a q-composite key pre-distribution scheme 
and a random pairwise keys scheme the q-composite scheme 
requires any two sensors share at least q pre-distributed keys the 
random scheme randomly picks pair of sensors and assigns each 
pair a unique random key inspired by the studies above and 
the polynomial-based key pre-distribution protocol liu et al 
further developed the idea addressed in the previous works and 
proposed a general framework of polynomial pool-based key 
predistribution the basic idea can be considered as the 
combination of the polynomial-based key pre-distribution and the 
key pool idea used in and based on such a framework 
they presented two pairwise key pre-distribution schemes a 
random subset assignment scheme and a grid-based scheme a 
polynomial pool is used in those schemes instead of using a key 
pool in the previous techniques the random subset assignment 
scheme assigns each sensor node the secrets generated from a 
random subset of polynomials in the polynomial pool the 
gridbased scheme associates polynomials with the rows and the 
columns of an artificial grid assigns each sensor node to a unique 
coordinate in the grid and gives the node the secrets generated 
from the corresponding row and column polynomials based on 
this grid each sensor node can then identify whether it can 
directly establish a pairwise key with another node and if not 
what intermediate nodes it can contact to indirectly establish the 
pairwise key 
a similar approach to those schemes described by liu et al was 
independently developed by du et a rather than on blundo s 
scheme their approach is based on blom s scheme in some 
cases it is essentially equivalent to the one in all of those 
schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic 
key pre-distribution scheme however the pairwise key 
establishment problem in sensor networks is still not well solved 
for the basic probabilistic and the q-composite key 
predistribution schemes as the number of compromised nodes 
increases the fraction of affected pairwise keys increases quickly 
as a result a small number of compromised nodes may affect a 
large fraction of pairwise keys though the random pairwise 
keys scheme doses not suffer from the above security problem it 
incurs a high memory overhead which increases linearly with the 
number of nodes in the network if the level of security is kept 
constant for the random subset assignment scheme it 
suffers higher communication and computation overheads 
in liu proposed a new hypercube-based pairwise key 
predistribution scheme which extends the grid-based scheme 
from a two dimensional grid to a multi-dimensional hypercube 
the analysis shows that hypercube-based scheme keeps some 
attractive properties of the grid-based scheme including the 
guarantee of establishing pairwise keys and the resilience to node 
compromises also when perfect security against node 
compromise is required the hypercube-based scheme can support 
a larger network by adding more dimensions instead of increasing 
the storage overhead on sensor nodes though hypercube-based 
scheme we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case of 
hypercube-based scheme has many attractive properties it 
requires any two nodes in sensor networks can communication 
directly with each other this strong assumption is impractical in 
most of the actual applications of the sensor networks 
in this paper we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution 
model of sensor networks and for which we propose a new 
pairwise key pre-distribution scheme the main contributions of 
this paper are as follows 
combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the 
polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution we setup a 
clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor 
networks based on the topology we propose a novel cluster 
distribution based hierarchical hypercube model to establish the 
pairwise key the key contribution is that our scheme dose not 
require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate 
with each other as the previous schemes do and it still maintains 
high probability of key establishment low memory overhead and 
good security performance we develop a kind of new pairwise 
key establishment algorithm with our hierarchical hypercube 
model 
the structure of this paper is arranged as follows in section a 
new distribution model of cluster deployed sensor networks is 
presented in section a new hierarchical hypercube model is 
proposed in section the mapping relationship between the 
clusters deployed sensor network and hierarchical hypercube 
model is discussed in section and section new pairwise key 
establishment algorithm are designed based on the hierarchical 
hypercube model and detailed analyses are described finally 
section presents a conclusion 
 preliminary 
definition key predistribution the procedure which is used 
to encode the corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms 
in sensor nodes before distribution is called key predistribution 
definition pairwise key for any two nodes a and b if they 
have a common key e then the key e is called a pairwise key 
between them 
definition key path for any two nodes a and ak when there 
has not a pairwise key between them if there exists a path 
a a a   ak- ak and there exists at least one pairwise key 
between the nodes ai and aj for ≤i≤k- and ≤j≤k then the path 
consisted of a a a   ak- ak is called a key path between a 
and ak 
definition n-dimensional hypercube an n-dimensional 
hypercube or n−cube h v n is a topology with the following 
properties it is consisted of n·vn- 
edges each node can be 
coded as a string with n positions such as b b  bn where 
 ≤b b   bn≤v- any two nodes are called neighbors which 
means that there is an edge between them iff there is just one 
position different between their node codes 
 model of clusters deployed 
sensor networks 
in some actual applications of sensor networks sensors can be 
deployed through airplanes supposing that the deployment 
rounds of sensors are k and the communication radius of any 
sensors is r then the sensors deployed in the same round can be 
regarded as belonging to a same cluster we assign a unique 
cluster number l ≤ l ≤ k for each cluster supposing that the 
sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment 
through airplanes and then the fig presents an actual model of 
clusters deployed sensor networks 
figure an actual model of clusters deployed sensor 
networks 
from figure it is easy to know that for a given node a there 
exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of a which can be 
communicated directly with a since the nodes are deployed 
densely in a cluster but there exist much less nodes in a cluster 
neighboring to the cluster of a which can be communicated 
directly with a since the two clusters are not deployed at the 
same time 
 hierarchical hypercube model 
definition k-levels hierarchical hypercube let there are n 
nodes totally then a k-levels hierarchical hypercube named 
h k u m v n can be constructed as follows 
 the n nodes are divided into k clusters averagely and 
the n k nodes in any cluster are connected into an n-dimensional 
hypercube in the n-dimensional hypercube any node is encoded 
 
as i i  in which are called in-cluster-hypercube-node-codes 
where ≤ i i  in ≤ v- v n 
kn j equals to an integer not 
less than j so we can obtain k such kind of different hypercubes 
 the k different hypercubes obtained above are encoded 
as j j  jm which are called out-cluster-hypercube-node-codes 
where ≤ j j  jm ≤ u- u m 
k and the nodes in the k 
different hypercubes are connected into m-dimensional 
hypercubes according to the following rules the nodes with same 
in-cluster-hypercube-node-codes and different 
out-clusterhypercube-node-codes are connected into an m-dimensional 
hypercube 
 the graph constructed through above steps is called a k-levels 
hierarchical hypercube abbreviated as h k u m v n 
 any node a in h k u m v n can be encoded as i j 
where i i i i  in ≤ i i  in ≤ v- is the 
in-cluster-hypercubenode-code of node a and j j j j  jm ≤ j j  jm ≤ u- is the 
out-cluster-hypercube-node-code of node a 
obviously the h k u m v n model has the following good 
properties 
property the diameter of h k u m v n model is m n 
proof since the diameter of n-dimensional hypercube is n 
and the diameter of m-dimensional hypercube is m so it is easy to 
know that the diameter of h k u m v n model is m n from the 
definition 
property the distance between any two nodes a i j and b i 
j in h k u m v n model is d a b dh i i dh j j where dh 
represents the hamming distance 
proof since the distance between any two nodes in 
hypercube equals to the hamming distance between them so it is 
obvious that the theorem s conclusion stands from definition 
 mapping clusters deployed 
sensor networks to h k u m v n 
obviously from the description in section and we can know 
that the clusters deployed sensor network can be mapped into a 
klevels- hierarchical hypercube model as follows 
at first the k clusters in the sensor network can be mapped into k 
different levels or hypercubes in the k-levels- hierarchical 
hypercube model then the sensor nodes in each cluster can be 
encoded with the in-cluster-hypercube-node-codes and the 
sensor nodes in the k different clusters with the same 
in-clusterhypercube-node-codes can be encoded with the 
out-clusterhypercube-node-codes according to the definition respectively 
consequently the whole sensor network has been mapped into a 
k-levels- hierarchical hypercube model 
 h k u m v n model-based 
pairwise key predistribution 
algorithm for sensor networks 
in order to overcome the drawbacks of polynomial-based and 
polynomial pool-based key predistribution algorithms this paper 
proposed an innovative h k u m v n model-based key 
predistribution scheme and pairwise key establishment algorithm 
which combines the advantages of polynomial-based and key 
pool-based encryption schemes and is based on the kdc and 
polynomials pool-based key predistribution models 
the new h k u m v n model-based pairwise key establishment 
algorithm includes three main steps generation of the 
polynomials pool and key predistribution direct pairwise key 
discovery path key discovery 
 generation of polynomials pool and key 
predistribution 
supposing that the sensor network includes n nodes and is 
deployed through k different rounds then we can predistribute 
keys for each sensor node on the basis of the h k u m v n model 
as follows

 direct pairwise key discovery 
if the node a i i  in j j  jm in the sensor network wants to 
establish pairwise key with a node b i i  i n j j  j m then 
node a can establish pairwise key with the node b trough the 
following methods 
firstly node a computes out the distance between itself and node 
b d d d where d dh i i  in i i  i n and d dh j j  jm 
j j  j m if d then node a obtains the direct pairwise key 
between itself and node b according to the following theorem 
theorem for any two sensor nodes a i i  in j j  jm and b 
 i i  i n j j  j m in the sensor network supposing that the 
 
distance between nodes a and b is d d d where d dh i i  in 
i i  i n and d dh j j  jm j j  j m if d then there exists a 
direct pairwise key between nodes a and b 
poof since d then there is d d or d d 
 if d d from d there is nodes a b belong to the 
same cluster supposing that nodes a b belong to the same 
cluster l then from d ⇒ there is only one position different 
between i i  in and i i  i n let it i t when ≤ t ≤ n- and 
in ≠ i n ⇒ f n 
iiil n − in i n f n 
iiil n ′′′ − i n in so there 
exists a direct pairwise key f n 
iiil n − in i n between nodes a 
and b 
 if d d from d ⇒ there is only one position 
different between j j  jm and j j  j m let jt j t when ≤ t ≤

i i  i n ⇒ f m

according to theorem we present the detailed description of the 
direct pairwise key discovery algorithm as follows

 to establish direct 
pairwise key 
step otherwise there exists no direct pairwise key 
between nodes a and b and then turn to the following path key 
discovery process 
 path key discovery 
if d then node a can establish path key with node b according 
to the following theorem 
theorem for any two sensor nodes a i i  in j j  jm and b 
 i i  i n j j  j m in the sensor network supposing that the 
distance between nodes a and b is d d d where d dh i i  in 
i i  i n and d dh j j  jm j j  j m if d then there exists a 
path key between nodes a and b 
proof let d a d b then we can think that it ≠ i t when 
 ≤ t ≤ a but it i t when t a and jt ≠ j t when ≤ t ≤ b but jt j t 
when t b obviously nodes a i i  in j j  jm i i i  in 
j j  jm i i i  in j j  jm   i i  i n j j  jm belong to the 
same cluster so according to the supposing condition of the 
nodes in the same cluster form a connected graph there is a 
route among those nodes in addition in those nodes the distance 
between any two neighboring nodes is so from theorem it is 
easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any 
two neighboring nodes among those nodes 
for nodes i i  i n j j  jm i i  i n j j j  jm 
 i i  i n j j j  jm- jm   i i  i n j j  j m- jm since they 
have the same out-cluster-hypercube-node-codes with the node 
b i i  i n j j  j m so nodes i i  i n j j  jm i i  i n j j 
j  jm i i  i n j j j  jm- jm   i i  i n j j  j m- jm and 
node b belong to a same logical hypercube obviously from the 
supposing condition of the whole sensor network forms a 
connected graph there is a route among those nodes in addition 
in those nodes the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 
 so from theorem it is easy to know that there exists direct 
pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those 
nodes 
so it is obvious that there exists a path key between nodes a 
and b 
according to theorem we present the detailed description of the 
path key discovery algorithm as follows 
step compute out the intermediate nodes i i 
i  in j j  jm i i i  in j j  jm   i i  i n j j  jm and 
 i i  i n j j j  jm i i  i n j j j  j m- 
jm   i i  i n j j  j m- jm from the source node 
a i i  in j j  jm and the destination node b i i  i n j j  j m 
step in those nodes series a i i  in j j  jm i i 
i  in j j  jm i i i  in j j  jm   i i  i n j j  jm and 
 i i  i n j j j  jm i i  i n j j j  j m- jm   i i  i n 
j j  j m- jm b i i  i n j j  j m the neighboring nodes select 
their common polynomial share to establish direct pairwise key 
from theorem it is easy to know that any source node a 
can compute out a key path p to the destination node b according 
to the above algorithm when there are no compromised nodes in 
the sensor network once the key path p is computed out then 
node a can send messages to b along the path p to establish 
indirect pairwise key with node b fig presents a example of 
key path establishment 
figure key path establishment example 
for example in the above figure node a can 
establish pairwise key with node b through the 
following key path a → c → 
d → e → f → 
b where node f shall route through nodes g h i 
j to establish direct pairwise key with node b 
 
according to the properties of h k u m v n model we can prove 
that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 
theorem supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in 
the sensor network and the distance between node a and b then 
there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node a 
and b logically that is to say node a can establish indirect 
pairwise key with node b through t- intermediate nodes 
proof supposing that the distance between node a i i  in 
j j  jm and b i i  i n j j  j m is d d d where 
d dh i i  in i i  i n d dh j j  jm j j  j m since d t 
according to the construction properties of h k u m v n it is easy 
to know that there exist t- intermediate nodes i   it- in the 
logical space h k u m v n which satisfy that the distance 
between any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series a 
i   it b equals to so according to the theorem we can know that 
nodes a i   it- b form a correct key path between node a and 
b if any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series a i   it- b 
can communicate directly then node a can establish indirect 
pairwise key with node b through those t- intermediate nodes 
 dynamic path key discovery 
the path key discovery algorithm proposed in the above section 
can establish a key path correctly only when there exist no 
compromised nodes in the whole sensor network since the key 
path is computed out beforehand and the proposed algorithm 
cannot find an alternative key path when there exist some 
compromised nodes or some intermediate nodes not in the 
communication radius even that there exists other alternative key 
paths in the sensor network from the following example we can 
know that there are many parallel paths in the h k u m v n model 
for any two given source and destination nodes since the 
h k u m v n model is high fault-tolerant 
 
figure alternative key path establishment example 
for example considering the key path establishment example 
given in the above section based on figure 
a → c → d → 
e → f → b 
supposing that node f has compromised then from 
figure we can know that there exists another alternative key 
path as a → c → d 
→e → m → b which 
can be used to establish the indirect pairwise key between node a 
and b where node e shall route through nodes d and k to 
establish direct pairwise key with node m and node m shall route 
through nodes n o g h i j to establish direct pairwise key 
with node b 
since the sensors are source limited so they are easy to die or out 
of the communication radius therefore the algorithm proposed in 
the above section cannot guarantee to establish correct key path 
efficiently in this section we will propose a dynamic path key 
discovery algorithm as follows which can improve the 
probability of key path effectively 
algorithm i dynamic key path establishment algorithm based on 
h k u m v n model for cluster deployed sensor networks 
input sub-sensor network h k u m v n which has some 
compromised fault sensors and fault links and two reachable 
nodes a a  an a  a m and b b  bn b  b m in h k u m v n 
where a t ≠ b t t∈ s a t b t t s 
output a correct key path from node a to b in h k u m v n 
step obtain the code strings of node a and b a ← 
 a  an a  a m b ← b  bn b  b m where aj bj ∈ u- 
a j b j ∈ v- 
step if a  a m b  b m then node a can find a route 
to b according to the routing algorithms of hypercube - 
step otherwise node a can find a route to c b  bn 
a  a m according to the algorithm i or algorithm ii then let 
i c b  bn a  a m i b  bn b a  a m   
is b b  bn b b  b s a s  a m and each node it in the above 
nodes series find a route to its neighboring node it on the basis 
of the location information detailed routing algorithms based on 
location information can see the references - 
step algorithm exits if such kind of a correct key path 
exists then through which node a can establish an indirect 
pairwise key with node b otherwise node a fails to establish an 
indirect pairwise key with node b and node a will tries again to 
establish an indirect pairwise key with node b some time later 
 algorithm analyses 
 practical analyses 
according to the former description and analyses it is easy to 
know that the above newly proposed algorithm has the following 
properties 
property when there exist no fault and compromised nodes by 
using new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on 
h k u m v n model the probability of direct pairwise key 
establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as 
p m u- n v- n- where n is the total number of nodes in 
the sensor network and n um

hypercube formed by the nodes in different clusters from that of 
node a there are m u- nodes which have direct pairwise key 
with node a therefore there are totally m u- n v- nodes 
which have direct pairwise key with node a so the probability of 
pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be 
estimated as p m u- n v- n- since the whole sensor

figure comparision between the probability of direct

based on h v n model 
from figure it is easy to know that by using new pairwise key 
predistribution scheme based on h k u m v n model the 
probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two 
nodes decreases with the increasing of the scale of the sensor 
networks and in addition the probability of direct pairwise key 
establishment between any two nodes decreases with the 
increasing of the dimension n when the scale of the sensor 
network is fixed 
theorem supposing that the total sensors is n in the sensor 
network then when u ≥ v 
 the probability of direct pairwise key 
establishment between any two nodes when using the key 
distribution scheme based on the hypercube model h v p is 
smaller than that when using the key distribution scheme based on 
the h k u m v n model 
proof since u ≥ v then we can let u vt 
 where t ≥ since 
the total number of nodes in h v p is vp

from the property it is easy to know that the probability of 
direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be 
estimated as p m u- n v- n- according to the 
description in it is well know that the probability of direct 
pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be 
estimated as p p v- n- x v- n v- n- 
next we will prove that m u- ≥ x v-

- v ≥ v- v v 
so there is f t ≥ ⇒ vt

therefore the conclusion of the theorem stands 
as for the conclusion of theorem we give an example to 
illustrate 
supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is

theorem supposing that the total sensors is n in the sensor

hypercube model h v p is only a special case of the pairwise key 
distribution scheme based on the h k u m v n model 
proof as for the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the 
h k u m v n model let k u m which means that the 
total sensor network includes only one cluster then obviously 
the h k u m v n model will degrade into the h v n model 
according to the former anayses in this paper and the definition 
of the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the hypercube 
model h v p in it is easy to know that the conclusion of the 
theorem stands 
 
 security analyses 
by using the pairwise key establishment algorithm based on the 
h k u m v n model the intruders can launch two kinds of attacks 
 the attackers may target the pairwise key between two 
particular sensor node in order to compromise the pairwise key 
between them or prevent them to establish pairwise key the 
attackers may attack against the whole sensor network inorder to 
decrease the probability of the pairwise key establishment or 
increase the cost of the pairwise key establishment 
attacks against a pair of sensor nodes 
 supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor 
nodes u v where u v are all not compromised nodes but the 
intruders want to compromise the pairwise key between them 
 if u v can establish direct pairwise key then the only way to 
compromise the key is to compromise the common bivariate 
polynomial f x y between u v since the degree of the bivariate 
polynomial f x y is t so the intruders need to compromise at least 
t sensor nodes that have a share of the bivariate polynomial f x y 
 if u v can establish indirect pairwise key through intermediate 
nodes then the intruders need to compromise at least one 
intermediate node or compromise the common bivariate 
polynomial f x y between two neighboring intermediate nodes but 
even if the intruders succeed to do that node u and v can still 
reestablish indirect pairwise key through alternative intermediate 
nodes 
 supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor 
nodes u v where u v are all not compromised nodes but the 
intruders want to prevent them to establish the pairwise key 
then the intruders need to compromise all of the m n bivariate 
polynomials of node u or v since the degree of the bivariate 
polynomial f x y is t so for bivariate polynomial the intruders need 
to compromise at least t sensor nodes that have a share of the 
given bivariate polynomial therefore the intruders need to 
compromise m n t sensor nodes altogether to prevent u v to 
establish the pairwise key 
attacks against the sensor network 
supposing that the attackers know the distribution of the 
polynomials over sensor nodes it may systematically attack the 
network by compromising the polynomials in f one by one in order 
to compromise the entire network assume the fraction of the 
compromised polynomials is pc then there are up to 
n pc × vn

sensor nodes that have at least one compromised polynomial share 
among all of the remaining n- n sensor nodes none of them 
includes a compromised polynomial share so the remaining n- n 
sensor nodes can establish direct pairwise key by using any one of 
their polynomial shares however the indirect pairwise keys in the 
remaining n- n sensor nodes may be affected and they may need 
to re-establish a new indirect pairwise key between them by select 
alternative intermediate nodes that do not belong to the n 
compromised nodes 
supposing that the scale of the sensor network is n figure 
presents the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes 
with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks 
based on different h k u m v n distribution models 
from figure it is easy to know that when the scale of the sensor 
network is fixed the number of the affected sensor nodes in the 
sensor network increases with the increasing of the number of 
compromised nodes

theorem supposing that the total sensors is n in the sensor 
network and the fraction of compromised nodes is pc then when 
u v the number of affected nodes of the h v p model based key 
predistribution scheme is bigger than that of the h k u m v n model 
based key predistribution scheme 
proof since the number of affected nodes of the h k u m v n 
model based key predistribution scheme is pc ××n m n and it is 
proved in that the number of affected nodes of the h v p model

correct and the number of the affected sensor nodes in the sensor

 conclusion 
a new hierarchical hypercube model named h k u m v n is 
proposed which can be used for pairwise key predistribution for 
cluster deployed sensor networks and based on the h k u m v n 
model an innovative pairwise key predistribution scheme and 
algorithm are designed respectively by combing the good 
properties of the polynomial key and key pool encryption 
schemes 
the new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes 
and high fault-tolerance of h k u m v n model to route and 
predistribute pairwise keys in which nodes are not needed to be 
able to communicate with each other directly such as that the 
algorithms proposed by shall need so the traditional pairwise 
key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model is 
only a special case of the new algorithm proposed in this paper 
theoretical and experimental analyses show that the newly 
proposed algorithm is an efficient pairwise key establishment 
algorithm that is suitable for the cluster deployed sensor networks
