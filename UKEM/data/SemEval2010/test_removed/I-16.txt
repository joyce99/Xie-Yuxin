abstract 
in this paper we present an advanced bidding agent that 
participates in first-price sealed bid auctions to allocate advertising space 
on bluscreen - an experimental public advertisement system that 
detects users through the presence of their bluetooth enabled 
devices our bidding agent is able to build probabilistic models of 
both the behaviour of users who view the adverts and the auctions 
that it participates within it then uses these models to maximise the 
exposure that its adverts receive we evaluate the effectiveness of 
this bidding agent through simulation against a range of alternative 
selection mechanisms including a simple bidding strategy random 
allocation and a centralised optimal allocation with perfect 
foresight our bidding agent significantly outperforms both the simple 
bidding strategy and the random allocation and in a mixed 
population of agents it is able to expose its adverts to more users than 
the simple bidding strategy moreover its performance is within 
 of that of the centralised optimal allocation despite the highly 
uncertain environment in which it must operate

 introduction 
electronic displays are increasingly being used within public 
environments such as airports city centres and retail stores in order to 
advertise commercial products or to entertain and inform 
passersby recently researchers have begun to investigate how the 
content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order 
to increase its variety relevance and exposure particular 
research attention has focused on the need to take into account the 
dynamic nature of the display s audience and to this end a number 
of interactive public displays have been proposed these displays 
have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users 
with pre-defined interests and requirements and have facilitated 
communication with these users through the active use of handheld 
devices such as pdas or phones as such these systems 
assume prior knowledge about the target audience and require 
either that a single user has exclusive access to the display or that 
users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be 
identified however these approaches fail to work in 
public spaces where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may 
view the display exists and where such displays need to react to 
the presence of several users simultaneously 
by contrast payne et al have developed an intelligent public 
display system named bluscreen that detects and tracks users 
through the bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them 
everyday within this system a decentralised multi-agent auction 
mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each 
public display each advert is represented by an individual 
advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been 
exposed to the advert this agent then seeks to acquire advertising 
cycles during which it can display its advert on the public displays 
by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed 
bid auction the value of these bids is based upon the number of 
users who are currently present in front of the screen the history 
of these users and an externally derived estimate of the value of 
exposing an advert to a user 
in this paper we present an advanced bidding agent that 
significantly extends the sophistication of this approach in particular 
we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to 
determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user 
this is likely to be the case for bluscreen installations within 
private organisations where the items being advertised are 
forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors and 
thus have no direct monetary value indeed in this case bidding is 
likely to be conducted in some virtual currency in addition it 
is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations 
where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation 
impossible in both cases it is more appropriate to assume that an 
advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget and 
that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this 
budget particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events 
the advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget 
to maximum effect i e to achieve the maximum possible advert 
exposure within this time period 
now in order to achieve this goal the advertising agent must be 
capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict 
the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle in 
addition it must also understand the auction environment in which 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
it competes in order that it may make best use of its limited budget 
thus in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this 
we advance the state of the art in four key ways 
 we enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and 
departure of users as independent poisson processes and to 
make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these 
processes based on their observations we show how these 
agents can then calculate the expected number of users who 
will be present during any future advertising cycle 
 using a decision theoretic approach we enable the 
advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given 
auction when a specific amount is bid the cumulative form of 
the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability 
and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the 
closing price of previous auctions and the bids that that 
advertising agent itself submits 
 we show that our explicit assumption that the advertising 
agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to 
a single user more than once causes the expected utility of 
each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected 
outcome of all the auctions that precede it we thus present a 
stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated 
annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the 
optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility 
 finally we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy 
outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features 
 within an heterogenous population the advertising agents 
who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose 
their adverts to more users than those using the simple 
bidding strategy and we show that it performs within 
of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of 
the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future 
advertising cycles 
the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 
discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces 
are used to allocated advertising space section describes the 
prototype bluscreen system that motivates our work in section we 
present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism 
and in section we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the 
advertising agents in section we present an empirical validation 
of our approach and finally we conclude in section 
 related work 
the commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been 
amply demonstrated on the internet where recommendation systems 
and contextual banner adverts are the norm these systems 
typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual 
viewing the material and such systems work well on personal 
devices where the owner s preferences and interests can be gathered 
and cached locally or within interactive environments which utilise 
some form of credential to identify the user e g e-commerce sites 
such as amazon com 
attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have 
been much more limited gerding et al present a simulated system 
 casy whereby a vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell 
advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall the 
auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by 
different retail outlets and the top ranking advertisements are 
selected for presentation on public displays feedback is provided 
through subsequent sales information allowing the model to build 
up a profile of a user s preferences however unlike the bluscreen 
figure a deployed bluscreen prototype 
system that we consider here it is not suitable for advertising to 
many individuals simultaneously as it requires explicit interaction 
with a single user to acquire the user s preferences 
by contrast mccarthy et al have presented a prototype 
implementation of a system groupcast that attempts to respond to a 
group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several 
members of the audience user identification is based on infrared 
badges and embedded sensors within an office environment when 
several users pass by the display a centralised system compares 
the user s profiles to identify common areas of interest and content 
that matches this common interest is shown 
thus whilst casy is a simulated system that allows advertisers 
to compete for the attention of single user groupcast is a 
prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects 
content to match their profiles despite their similarities neither 
system addresses the settings that interests us here how to allocate 
advertising space between competing advertisers who face an 
audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile 
information thus in the next section we describe the prototype 
bluscreen system that motivates our work 
 the bluscreen prototype 
bluscreen is based on the notion of a scalable extendable 
advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to 
as many relevant users as possible within a knowledge-poor 
environment to achieve these goals several requirements have been 
identified 
 adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as 
possible whilst minimising the number of times the advert is 
presented to any single user 
 users should be identified by existing ubiquitous consumer 
devices so that future deployments within public arenas will 
not require uptake of new hardware 
 the number of displays should be scalable such that adverts 
appear on different displays at different times 
 knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the 
audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user 
interests which can be exploited by the system 
to date a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has 
been demonstrated this system uses a inch flat-screen 
display deployed within an office environment to advertise events and 
news items rather than requiring the deployment of specialised 
hardware such as active badges see for details bluscreen 
detects the presence of users in the vicinity of each display through 
the bluetooth-enabled devices that they carry with them everyday

table number of bluetooth devices observed at different 
frequencies over a six month sample period 
this approach is attractive since the bluetooth wireless protocol 
is characterised by its relative maturity market penetration and 
emphasis on short-range communication table summarises the 
number of devices detected by this prototype installation over a 
six month period of the bluetooth devices detected 
approximately were detected regularly showing that bluetooth is a 
suitable proxy for detecting individuals in front of the screen 
in order to achieve a scalable and extendable solution a 
multiagent systems design philosophy is adopted whereby a number of 
different agents types interact see figure the interactions of 
these agents are implemented through a web services protocol 
 
and they constitute a decentralised marketplace that allocates 
advertising space in an efficient and timely manner in more detail 
the responsibilities of each agent types are 
bluetooth device detection agent this agent monitors the 
environment in the vicinity of a bluscreen display and 
determines the number and identity of any bluetooth devices that 
are close by it keeps historical records of the arrival and 
departure of bluetooth devices and makes this information 
available to advertising agents as requested 
marketplace agent this agent facilitates the sale of advertising 
space to the advertising agents a single marketplace agent 
represents each bluscreen display and access to this screen 
is divided into discrete advertising cycles of fixed duration 
before the start of each advertising cycle the marketplace 
agent holds a sealed-bid auction see section for more 
details the winner of this auction is allocated access to the 
display during the next cycle 
advertising agent this agent represents a single advert and is 
responsible for submitting bids to the marketplace agent in 
order that it may be allocated advertising cycles and thus 
display its advert to users it interacts with the device 
detection agent in order to collect information regarding the 
number and identity of users who are currently in front of 
the display on the basis of this information its past 
experiences and its bidding strategy it calculates the value of the 
bid that it should submit to the marketplace agent 
thus having described the prototype bluscreen system we next go 
on to describe the details of the auction mechanism that we consider 
in this work and then the advanced bidding agent that operates bids 
within this auction 
 the auction mechanism 
as described above bluscreen is designed to efficiency allocate 
advertising cycles in a distributed and timely manner thus 
oneshot sealed bid auctions are used for the market mechanism of the 
marketplace agent in previous work each advertising agent was 
assumed to have an externally derived estimate of the value of 
exposing an advert to a user under this assumption a 
secondprice sealed-bid auction was shown to be effective since

figure the bluscreen agent architecture for a single display 
ing agents have a simple strategy of truthfully bidding their 
valuation in each auction 
however as described earlier in this paper we consider the more 
general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori 
valuation for exposing an advert to a single user this may be because 
the bluscreen installation is within a private organisation where 
what is being advertised e g news items or forthcoming events 
has no monetary value or it may be a new commercial installation 
where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation 
impossible in the absence of such a valuation the attractive 
economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved 
in practise and thus in our work there is no need to limit our 
attention to the second-price auction indeed since these auctions are 
actually extremely rare within real world settings in this work 
we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this 
increases the applicability of our results 
thus in more detail we consider an instance of a bluscreen 
installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single 
marketplace agent 
 we consider that access to the display screen 
is divided into discrete advertising cycles each of length tc and a 
first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of 
each advertising cycle the marketplace agent announces the start 
and deadline of the auction and collects sealed bids from each 
advertising agent at the closing time of the auction the marketplace 
agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the 
winning bid and informs the winning advertising agent that it was 
successful the identity of the winning advertising agent is not 
announced to all observers in the case that no bids are placed within 
any auction a default advert is displayed 
having described the market mechanism that the marketplace 
agent implements we now go on to describe and evaluate an 
advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents to adopt 
 advanced bidding strategy 
as described above we consider the case that the advertising agents 
do not have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing 
the advert to a single user rather they have a constrained budget 
b and a limited period of interest during which they wish to 
display their advert their goal is then to find the appropriate amount 
to bid within each auction in this period in order to maximise the 
exposure of their advert 
in attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced 
with a high level of uncertainty about future events it will be 
uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any 
advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 
 
this assumption of having a single bluscreen instance is made 
to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency 
of the proposed mechanism and strategy and generalising these 
results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
is known some may leave before the advert commences and 
others may arrive moreover the amount that must be bid to ensure 
that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number 
and behaviour of the competing advertising agents 
thus we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival 
and departure of users to build a probabilistic model based upon 
independent poisson processes that describes the number of users 
who are likely to be exposed to any advert in addition we enable 
the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle 
auctions and use the observations of the closing price and the success 
or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted to build a 
probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction the agent then uses 
these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising 
cycle and in turn determine the optimal sequence of bids that 
maximises this utility given its constrained budget having calculated 
this sequence of bids then the first bid in the sequence is actually 
used in the auction for the next advertising cycle however at the 
close of this cycle the process is repeated with a new optimal 
sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what 
actually happened in the preceding auction i e whether the bid 
was successful or not and how many users arrived or departed 
thus in the next three subsections we describe these two 
probabilistic models and their application within the bidding strategy of 
the advertising agent 
 predicting the number of users 
in order to predict the number of users that will be present in any 
future advertising cycle it is necessary to propose a probabilistic 
model for the behaviour of the users thus our advanced bidding 
strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by 
two independent poisson processes 
with arrival rate λa and 
departure rate λd this represents a simple model that is commonly 
applied within queuing theory 
 yet is one that we believe well 
describes the case where bluscreen displays are placed in 
communal areas where people meet and congregate given the history of 
users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection 
agent the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood 
estimation of the values of λa and λd 
in more detail if the advertising agent has observed n users 
arriving within a time period t then the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by 
λa 
n 
t 
 
likewise if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay 
of t t tn time periods then the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the departure rate λd is given by 
 
λd 
 
 
n 
n 
i 
ti 
 
given a poisson distribution with rate parameter λ the number of 
events n within an interval of time t is given by 
p n 
e−λt 
 λt n 
n 
in addition the probability of having to wait a period of time t 
before the next event is determined by 
p t λeλt 
 
note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate 
and service times of customers that are modelled as poisson 
processes our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the 
duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users

figure example showing how to predict the number of users 
who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc 
commencing at time t in the future 
in environments where these rates are subject to change the agent 
can use a limited time window over which observations are used 
to estimate these rates alternatively in situations where cyclic 
changes in these rates are likely to occur i e changing arrival and 
departure rates at different times of the day as may be seen in areas 
where commuters pass through the agent can estimate separate 
values over each hour long period 
having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users and 
knowing the number of users who are present at the current time 
the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users 
who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle 
 thus 
we consider the problem of predicting this number for an 
advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future given 
that n users are currently present see figure this number will 
be composed of three factors i the fraction of the n users that are 
initially present who do not leave in the interval ≤ τ t before 
the advertising cycle commences ii users that actually arrive in 
the interval ≤ τ t and are still present when the advertising 
cycle actually commences and finally iii users that arrive during 
the course of the advertising cycle t ≤ τ t tc 
now considering case i above the probability of one of the n 
users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given 
by 
∞

dτ e−λdt 
 thus we expect ne−λdt 
of these 
users to be present in case ii we expect λat new users to 
arrive before the advertising cycle commences and the probability 
that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is 
given by

 − e−λdt 
 thus we expect 
λa 
λd 
 − e−λdt 
of these users to be present finally in case iii 
we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising 
cycle thus the combination of these three factors gives an 
expression for the expected number of users who will be present within 
an advertising cycle of length tc that commencing at time t in the 
future given that there are n users currently present 
nn t ne−λdt

note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the 
initial number of users n the mean number of users present at 
any time is simply λa λd and the mean number of users exposed 
to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc 
λd 
 
 predicting the probability of winning 
in addition to estimating the number of users who will be present 
in any advertising cycle an effective bidding agent must also be 
able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it 
submits any specified bid this is a common problem within 
bidding agents and approaches can generally be classified as game 
theoretic or decision theoretic since our advertising agents are 
unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 
 
note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire 
advertising cycle in order to be counted as present 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
agents the game theoretic approach is precluded thus we take a 
decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within 
continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price 
of goods by observing transaction prices 
thus our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to 
describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted 
bid p b this function must have support ∞ since bids must 
be positive in addition we expect it to exhibit by an  s shaped 
curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when 
the submitted bid is very low the probability is close to one when 
the bid is very high and there is a transition point that characterises 
the change from a losing to a wining bid to this end we use the 
cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function 
p b 
γ k b θ 
γ k 
 
where γ k is the standard gamma function and γ k b θ is the 
incomplete gamma function this function has the necessary 
properties described above and has two parameters k and θ the 
transition point where p b is given by kθ and the sharpness of 
the transition is described by kθ 
 in figure we show examples of 
this function for three different values of k and θ 
the advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k 
and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous 
auctions an observation is a pair bi oi consisting of the bid 
bi and an auction outcome oi each auction generates at least one 
pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction and 
oi in addition another pair is generated for each unsuccessful 
bid submitted by the advertising agent itself and in this case oi 
 thus having collected n such pairs 
 the agent finds the values 
of k and θ by evaluating 
arg min 
k θ 
n 
i 
oi − 
γ k bi θ 
γ k 
 
 
this expression can not be evaluated analytically but can be simply 
found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the 
values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the 
transition point described above the gradient of this expression 
is then numerically evaluated at these points and new estimates of 
k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction 
of maximum gradient this process is repeated until k and θ have 
converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy 
 expected utility of an advertising cycle 
the goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure 
for its advert given its constrained budget we define the utility 
of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will 
see the advert for the first time during that cycle and hence we 
explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing 
the advert to any user more than once 
 thus we can use the results 
of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each 
advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agent s period of 
 
in the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed there is 
no evidence of where the transition point between successful and 
unsuccessful bids is likely to occur thus in this case an 
additional pair with value α min b bn is automatically 
created here α ∈ determines how far below the lowest 
successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be we 
have typically used α within our experiments 
 
as noted before we assume that a user has seen the advert if they 
are present during any part of the advertising cycle and we do not 
differentiate between users who see the entire advert or users who 
see a fraction of it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probability of winning auction p b

k 
k 
figure cumulative gamma distribution representing the 
probability of winning an auction θ and k 
interest in the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by 
the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction given 
that it submits a bid b and the number of users who are currently in 
front of the bluscreen display but have not seen the advert before 
is n thus the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply 
described by 
u p b nn 
now in the second advertising cycle the expected utility will clearly 
depend on the outcome of the auction for the first if the first 
auction was indeed won by the agent then there will be no users who 
have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second 
advertising cycle thus in this case the expected number of new users 
who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described 
by n i e only newly arriving users will contribute any utility 
by contrast if the first auction was not won by the agent then the 
expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by 
nn tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle i e 
exactly the case described in section where there are n users 
initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the 
future thus the expected utility of the second advertising cycle 
is given by 
u p b p b n − p b nn tc 
we can generalise this result by noting that the number of users 
expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend 
on the number of cycles since an auction was last won since at this 
point the number of users who are present but have not seen the 
advert must be equal to zero thus we must sum over all possible 
ways in which this can occur and weight each by its probability 
hence the general case for any advertising cycle is described by 
the rather complex expression

thus given this expression the goal of the advertising agent is to 
calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions such 
that the total expected utility is maximised whilst ensuring that the

having calculated this sequence a bid of b is submitted in the next 
auction once the outcome of this auction is known the process 
repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for 
the remaining advertising cycles of the agent s period of interest 
 optimal sequence of bids 
solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 
can not be performed analytically instead we develop a numerical 
routine to perform this maximisation however it is informative to 
initially consider the simple case of just two auctions 
 two auction example 
in this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply 
given by u u as described in equations and and the 
bidding sequence is solely dependent on b since b b−b thus 
we can plot the total expected utility against b and graphically 
determine the optimal value of b and thus also b 
to this end figure shows an example calculated using 
parameter values λa λd and tc in this case we 
assume that k and θ and thus given that kθ describes 
the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution a bid of 
represents a chance of winning any auction i e p 
in addition we assume that n λa λd and thus the initial 
number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect 
to find present at any time the plot indicates that when the budget 
is small then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values 
of b this corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions 
 i e b and b b or b b and b however as the 
budget increases the plot passes through a transition whereby the 
maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis 
corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions i e b b b 
this is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate 
the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the 
probability of actually winning this auction approaches one 
in this case the plot is completely symmetrical since the 
number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value i e 
n λa λd if however n λa λd the plot is skewed such that 
when the budget is small it should be allocated to the second 
auction since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising 
cycle commences conversely when n λa λd the entire 
budget should be allocated to the first auction since the users who are 
currently present are likely to depart in the near future however 
in both cases a transition occurs whereby given sufficient budget it 
is preferable to allocate the budget evenly between both auctions

optimal sequence of bids in the general case of multiple auctions 
 general case 
in general the behaviour seen in the previous example 
characterises the optimal bidding behaviour of the advertising agent if 
there is sufficient budget bidding equally in all auctions results in 
the maximum expected utility however typically this is not 
possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget 
is available into a subset of the available auction the choice of 
this subset is determined by a number of factors if there are very 
few users currently present it is optimal to allocate the budget to 
later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive 
conversely if there are many users present a significant proportion of 
the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is 
indeed won and these users see the advert finally since no utility 
is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once 
the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between 
showings of the advert in order that new users may arrive 
now due to the complex form of the expression for the expected 
utility of the agent shown in equation it is not possible to 
analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids however the inverse 
problem that of calculating the expected utility for any given 
sequence of bids is easy thus we can use a stochastic optimisation 
routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation 
problem this algorithm starts by assuming some initial random 
allocation of bids normalised such that the total of all the bids is 
equal to the budget b it then makes small adjustments to this 
allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to 
another if this transfer results in an increase in expected utility 
then it is accepted if it results in a decrease in expected utility it 
might still be accepted but with a probability that is determined by 
a temperature parameter this temperature parameter is annealed 
such that the probability of accepting such transfers decreases over 
time in figure we present this algorithm in pseudo-code 
 evaluation 
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced bidding 
strategy developed within this paper we compare its performance to 
three alternative mechanisms one of these mechanisms represents 
a simple alternative bidding strategy for the advertising agents whilst 
the other two are centralised allocation mechanisms that represent 
expected utility between this and an even allocation is negliable

figure comparison of four different allocation mechanisms for allocating advertising cycles to advertising agents results are 
averaged over simulation runs and error bars indicate the standard error in the mean 
the upper and lower bounds to the overall performance of the 
system in more detail the four mechanisms that we compare are 
random allocation rather than implementing the auction 
mechanism the advertising cycle is randomly allocated to one of 
the advertising agents 
simple bidding strategy we implement the full auction 
mechanism but with a population of advertising agents that 
employ a simple bidding strategy these advertising agents do 
not attempt to model the users or the auction environment in 
which they bid but rather they simply evenly allocate their 
remaining budget over the remaining advertising cycles 
advanced bidding strategy we implement the full auction 
mechanism with a population of advertising agents using the 
probabilistic models and the bidding strategy described here 
optimal allocation rather than implementing the auction 
mechanism the advertising cycle is allocated to the advertising 
agent that will derive the maximum utility from it given 
perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrive and 
depart in all future advertising cycles 
using these four alternative allocation mechanisms we ran repeated 
simulations of two hours of operation of the entire bluscreen 
environment for a default set of parameters whereby the arrival and 
departure rate of the users are given by λa s and λd 
 s and the length of an advertising cycle is s each 
advertising agent is assigned an advert with a period of interest drawn 
from a poisson distribution with a mean of advertising cycles and 
these agents are initially allocated a budget equal to times their 
period of interest for each simulation run we measure the mean 
normalised exposure of each advert that is the fraction of users 
who were detected by the bluscreen display during the period of 
interest of the advertising agent who were actually exposed to the 
agent s advert thus a mean normalised exposure of indicates 
that the agent managed to expose its advert to all of the users who 
were present during its period of interest and a mean normalised 
exposure of means that no users were exposed to the advert 
figure shows the results of this experiments we first observe 
the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases 
and thus the competition between them increases then the mean 
normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases we 
then observe that in all cases there is no statistically significant 
improvement in using the simple bidding strategy compared to 
random allocation p in student s t-test since this simple 
bidding strategy does not take account of the number of users present 
and in general simply increases its bid price in each auction until it 
does in fact win one this is not unexpected however in all cases 
the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform 
the simple bidding agent p in student s t-test and its 
performance is within of that of the optimal allocation that 
has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and 
depart in all future advertising cycles 
in addition we present results of experiments performed over a 
range of parameter values and also with a mixed population of 
advertising agents using both the advanced and simple bidding 
strategies this is an important scenario since advertisers may wish to 
supply their own bidding agents and thus a homogeneous 
population is not guaranteed in each case keeping all other parameters 
fixed we varied one parameter and these results are shown in 
figure in general we see the similar trends as before increasing 
the departure rate causes an decrease in the mean normalised 
exposure since advertising agents have less opportunities to expose 
users to their adverts increasing the period of interest of each 
agent decreases the mean normalised exposure since more 
advertising agents are now competing for the same users finally 
increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple 
and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another since the 
variance in the number of users who are present during any 
advertising cycle decreases and thus modelling their behaviour provides 
less gain however in all cases the advanced bidding strategy 
significantly outperforms the simple one p in student s 
t-test on average we observe that advertising agents who use the 
advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 
more users than those using the simple bidding strategy 
finally we show that a rational advertising agent who has a 
choice of bidding strategy would always opt to use the advanced 
bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy regardless of the 
composition of the population that it finds itself in figure shows 
the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when 
the population is composed of different fractions of the two 
bidding strategies in each case the advanced bidding strategy shows 
a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding 
strategy p in student s t-test and thus gains improved 
exposure over all population compositions 
 conclusions 
in this paper we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by 
advertising agents within the bluscreen advertising system this 
bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict 
the arrival and departure of users and also to model their 
success within a first-price sealed bid auction by observing both the 
bids that they themselves submitted and the winning bid the

pected utility measured as the number of users who the advertising 
agent exposes its advert to was shown to depend on these factors 
and resulted in a complex expression where the expected utility of 
each auction depended on the success or otherwise of earlier 
auctions we presented an algorithm based upon simulated annealing 
to solve for the optimal bidding strategy and in simulation this 
bidding strategy was shown to significantly outperform a simple 
bidding strategy that had none of these features its performance 
closely approached that of a central optimal allocation with 
perfect knowledge of the arrival and departure of users despite the 
uncertain environment in which the strategy must operate 
our future work in this area consists of extending this bidding 
strategy to richer environments where there are multiple 
interrelated display screens where maintaining profiles of users allows 
a richer matching of user to advert and where alternative auction 
mechanisms are applied we a particularly interesting in 
introducing a  pay per user auction setting similar to the  pay per click 
auctions employed by internet search websites this work will 
continue to be done in conjunction with the deployment of more 
bluscreen prototypes in order to gain further real world experience
