abstract 
in multiagent systems strategic settings are often analyzed 
under the assumption that the players choose their strategies 
simultaneously however this model is not always realistic 
in many settings one player is able to commit to a 
strategy before the other player makes a decision such models 
are synonymously referred to as leadership commitment or 
stackelberg models and optimal play in such models is often 
significantly different from optimal play in the model where 
strategies are selected simultaneously 
the recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic 
solutions has so far ignored leadership models with the 
exception of the interest in mechanism design where the 
designer is implicitly in a leadership position in this 
paper we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit 
to under both commitment to pure strategies and 
commitment to mixed strategies in both normal-form and bayesian 
games we give both positive results efficient algorithms

 introduction 
in multiagent systems with self-interested agents 
 including most economic settings the optimal action for one agent 
to take depends on the actions that the other agents take 
to analyze how an agent should behave in such settings the 
tools of game theory need to be applied typically when a 
strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game 
theory it is assumed that players choose their strategies 
simultaneously this is especially true when the setting is 
modeled as a normal-form game which only specifies each 
agent s utility as a function of the vector of strategies that 
the agents choose and does not provide any information on 
the order in which agents make their decisions and what 
the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents 
given that the game is modeled in normal form it is 
typically analyzed using the concept of nash equilibrium a 
nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player such 
that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from 
this profile of strategies typically the strategies are 
allowed to be mixed that is probability distributions over the 
original pure strategies a mixed-strategy nash 
equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games but one 
problem is that there may be multiple nash equilibria this 
leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent 
can know which strategy to play if it does not know which 
equilibrium is to be played 
when the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game 
it is possible to specify that some players receive some 
information about actions taken by others earlier in the game 
before deciding on their action nevertheless in general 
the players do not know everything that happened earlier 
in the game because of this these games are typically still 
analyzed using an equilibrium concept where one specifies 
a mixed strategy for each player and requires that each 
player s strategy is a best response to the others strategies 
 typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now 
imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is 
irrational with respect to the information that they have 
received so far this leads to refinements of nash equilibrium 
such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium 
however in many real-world settings strategies are not 
selected in such a simultaneous manner oftentimes one 
player the leader is able to commit to a strategy before 
another player the follower this can be due to a 
variety of reasons for example one of the players may 
arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before 
another agent e g in economic settings one player may 
enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing 
busi 
ness such commitment power has a profound impact on 
how the game should be played for example the leader 
may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the 
normal-form representation of the game perhaps the 
earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is 
that by von stackelberg who showed that in cournot s 
duopoly model if one firm is able to commit to a 
production quantity first that firm will do much better than in 
the simultaneous-move nash solution in general if 
commitment to mixed strategies is possible then under minor 
assumptions it never hurts and often helps to commit to 
a strategy being forced to commit to a pure strategy 
sometimes helps and sometimes hurts for example 
committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the 
other player s decision will naturally result in a loss in 
this paper we will assume commitment is always forced if 
it is not the player who has the choice of whether to 
commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the 
non-commitment simultaneous-move outcome 
models of leadership are especially important in settings 
with multiple self-interested software agents once the code 
for an agent or for a team of agents is finalized and the 
agent is deployed the agent is committed to playing the 
 possibly randomized strategy that the code prescribes thus 
as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the 
code later the code serves as a commitment device this 
holds true for recreational tournaments among agents e g 
poker tournaments robosoccer and for industrial 
applications such as sensor webs 
finally there is also an implicit leadership situation in the 
field of mechanism design in which one player the designer 
gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining 
players then play mechanism design is an extremely important 
topic to the ec community the papers published on 
mechanism design in recent ec conferences are too numerous 
to cite indeed the mechanism designer may benefit from 
committing to a choice that if the remaining agents 
actions were fixed would be suboptimal for example in a 
 first-price auction the seller may wish to set a positive 
 artificial reserve price for the item below which the item 
will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at in 
hindsight after the bids have come in this na¨ıvely 
appears suboptimal if a bid exceeding the reserve price came 
in the reserve price had no effect and if no such bid came 
in the seller would have been better off accepting a lower 
bid of course the reason for setting the reserve price is 
that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher and because 
of this setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase 
expected revenue to the seller 
a significant amount of research has recently been 
devoted to the computation of solutions according to various 
solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose 
their strategies simultaneously such as dominance 
and especially nash equilibrium 
 however the computation of the optimal strategy to 
commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored 
theoretically leadership situations can simply be thought of as 
an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a 
strategy for the original game first the number of strategies 
in this extensive-form game however can be exceedingly 
large for example if the leader is able to commit to a 
mixed strategy in the original game then every one of the 
 continuum of mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy 
in the extensive-form representation of the leadership 
situation we note that a commitment to a distribution is not 
the same as a distribution over commitments moreover 
if the original game is itself an extensive-form game the 
number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of 
the leadership situation which is a different extensive-form 
game becomes even larger because of this it is usually 
not computationally feasible to simply transform the 
original game into the extensive-form representation of the 
leadership situation instead we have to analyze the game in its 
original representation 
in this paper we study how to compute the optimal 
strategy to commit to both in normal-form games section 
and in bayesian games which are a special case of 
extensiveform games section 
 normal-form games 
in this section we study how to compute the optimal 
strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form 
 definitions 
in a normal-form game every player i ∈ n has a 
set of pure strategies or actions si and a utility function 
ui s ×s × ×sn → r that maps every outcome a vector 
consisting of a pure strategy for every player also known 
as a profile of pure strategies to a real number to ease 
notation in the case of two players we will refer to player 
 s pure strategy set as s and player s pure strategy set 
as t such games can be represented in bi- matrix form 
in which the rows correspond to player s pure strategies 
the columns correspond to player s pure strategies and 
the entries of the matrix give the row and column player s 
utilities in that order for the corresponding outcome of the 
game in the case of three players we will use r s and t 
for player and s pure strategies respectively a mixed 
strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that 
player s pure strategies in the case of two-player games 
we will refer to player as the leader and player as the 
follower 
before defining optimal leadership strategies consider the 
following game which illustrates the effect of the leader s 
ability to commit 
 
 
in this normal-form representation the bottom strategy 
for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy 
nevertheless if the row player has the ability to commit to 
a pure strategy before the column player chooses his 
strategy the row player should commit to the bottom strategy 
doing so will make the column player prefer to play the 
right strategy leading to a utility of for the row player 
by contrast if the row player were to commit to the top 
strategy the column player would prefer to play the left 
strategy leading to a utility of only for the row player if 
the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy then 
she can get an even greater expected utility if the row 
player commits to placing probability p on the 
bottom strategy then the column player will still prefer to play 
the right strategy and the row player s expected utility will 
be p − p − p ≥ if the row player plays each 
strategy with probability exactly the column player is 
 
indifferent between the strategies in such cases we will 
assume that the column player will choose the strategy that 
maximizes the row player s utility in this case the right 
strategy hence the optimal mixed strategy to commit to 
for the row player is p there are a few good 
reasons for this assumption if we were to assume the opposite 
then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row 
player in the example game the row player would play the 
bottom strategy with probability p with 
and the smaller the better the utility for the row player 
by contrast if we assume that the follower always breaks 
ties in the leader s favor then an optimal mixed strategy 
for the leader always exists and this corresponds to a 
subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form 
representation of the leadership situation in any case this is a 
standard assumption for such models e g although some 
work has investigated what can happen in the other 
subgame perfect equilibria for generic two-player games 
the leader s subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique 
also the same assumption is typically used in mechanism 
design in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent 
between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them 
falsely he will report them truthfully given this 
assumption we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies 
rather than having to use some equilibrium notion 
hence for the purposes of this paper an optimal strategy 
to commit to in a -player game is a strategy s ∈ s that 
maximizes maxt∈br s ul s t where br s 
arg maxt∈t uf s t ul and uf are the leader and follower s 
utility functions respectively we can have s s for the 
case of commitment to pure strategies or s ∆ s the 
set of probability distributions over s for the case of 
commitment to mixed strategies we note that replacing t 
by ∆ t makes no difference in this definition for games 
with more than two players in which the players commit 
to their strategies in sequence we define optimal strategies 
to commit to recursively after the leader commits to a 
strategy the game to be played by the remaining agents is 
itself a smaller leadership game thus we define an 
optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes 
the leader s utility assuming that the play of the remaining 
agents is itself optimal under this definition and maximizes 
the leader s utility among all optimal ways to play the 
remaining game again commitment to mixed strategies may 
or may not be a possibility for every player although for the 
last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to 
mixed strategies 
 commitment to pure strategies 
we first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy 
to commit to this is relatively simple because the number 
of strategies to commit to is not very large in the following 
 outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles 
theorem under commitment to pure strategies the 
set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game 
can be found in o players · outcomes time 
proof each pure strategy that the first player may 
commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players we 
can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its 
optimal strategy profiles each of these will give the 
original leader some utility those that give the leader maximal 
utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of 
the original game 
we now present the algorithm formally let su g s be 
the subgame that results after the first remaining player 
in g plays s ∈ sg 
 a game with players is simply an 
outcome of the game the function append s o appends 
the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set 
o let e be the empty vector with no elements in a slight 
abuse of notation we will write ug 
 c when all strategy 
profiles in the set c give player the same utility in the 
game g here player is the first remaining player in the 
subgame g not necessarily player in the original game 
we note that arg max is set-valued then the following 
algorithm computes all optimal strategy profiles 
algorithm solve g 
if g has players 
return e 
c ← ∅ 
for all s ∈ sg 
 
o ← solve su g s 
o ← arg maxo∈o ug 
 s o 
if c ∅ or ug 
 s o ug 
 c 
c ← c∪append s o 
if ug 
 s o ug 
 c 
c ←append s o 
 
return c 
every outcome is potentially examined by every player 
which leads to the given runtime bound 
as an example of how the algorithm works consider the 
following -player game in which the first player chooses 
the left or right matrix the second player chooses a row 
and the third player chooses a column 
 
 
 
 
 
 
first we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond 
to best responses for the third player removing them from 
the matrix 
 
 
 
 
 
 
next we remove the entries in which the third player 
does not break ties in favor of the second player as well 
as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the 
second player 
 
 
 
finally we remove the entries in which the second and 
third players do not break ties in favor of the first player as 
well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for 
the first player 
 
 
hence in optimal play the first player chooses the left 
matrix the second player chooses the middle row and the 
third player chooses the left column we note that this 
outcome is pareto-dominated by right middle left 
for general normal-form games each player s utility for 
each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the 
input so that the input size is itself ω players · outcomes 
therefore the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm 
 commitment to mixed strategies 
in the special case of two-player zero-sum games 
computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to 
is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy which 
minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can 
obtain minimax strategies constitute the only natural 
solution concept for two-player zero-sum games von neumann s 
minimax theorem states that in two-player zero-sum 
games it does not matter in terms of the players utilities 
which player gets to commit to a mixed strategy first and a 
profile of mixed strategies is a nash equilibrium if and only 
if both strategies are minimax strategies it is well-known 
that a minimax strategy can be found in polynomial time 
using linear programming our first result in this 
section generalizes this result showing that an optimal mixed 
strategy for the leader to commit to can be efficiently 
computed in general-sum two-player games again using linear 
programming 
theorem in -player normal-form games an optimal 
mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time 
using linear programming 
proof for every pure follower strategy t we compute a 
mixed strategy for the leader such that playing t is a best 
response for the follower and under this constraint the 
mixed strategy maximizes the leader s utility such a mixed 
strategy can be computed using the following simple linear 
program 
maximize 
s∈s 
psul s t 
subject to 
for all t ∈ t 
s∈s 
psuf s t ≥ 
s∈s 
psuf s t 
s∈s 
ps 
we note that this program may be infeasible for some 
follower strategies t for example if t is a strictly 
dominated strategy nevertheless the program must be feasible 
for at least some follower strategies among these follower 
strategies choose a strategy t 
that maximizes the linear 
program s solution value then if the leader chooses as her 
mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps for 
the linear program for t 
 and the follower plays t 
 this 
constitutes an optimal strategy profile 
in the following result we show that we cannot expect to 
solve the problem more efficiently than linear programming 
because we can reduce any linear program with a probability 
constraint on its variables to a problem of computing the 
optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a -player 
normalform game 
theorem any linear program whose variables xi with 
xi ∈ r≥ 
 must satsify 
i 
xi can be modeled as a 
problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in 
a -player normal-form game 
proof let the leader have a pure strategy i for every 
variable xi let the column player have one pure 
strategy j for every constraint in the linear program other than 
i 
xi and a single additional pure strategy let the 
utility functions be as follows writing the objective of the 
linear program as maximize 
i 
cixi for any i let ul i 
ci and uf i writing the jth constraint of the linear 
program not including 
i 
xi as 
i 
aijxi ≤ bj for any 
i j let ul i j mini ci − and uf i j aij − bj 
for example consider the following linear program 
maximize x x 
subject to 
x x 
 x x ≤ 
 x − x ≤ 
the optimal solution to this program is x x 
 our reduction transforms this program into the 
following leader-follower game where the leader is the row 
player 
 
 - - 
indeed the optimal strategy for the leader is to play the 
top strategy with probability and the bottom strategy 
with probability we now show that the reduction works 
in general 
clearly the leader wants to incentivize the follower to play 
 because the utility that the leader gets when the follower 
plays is always greater than when the follower does not 
play in order for the follower not to prefer playing j 
rather than it must be the case that 
i 
pl i aij − bj ≤ 
 or equivalently 
i 
pl i aij ≤ bj hence the leader will 
get a utility of at least mini ci if and only if there is a 
feasible solution to the constraints given that the pl i 
incentivize the follower to play the leader attempts to 
maximize 
i 
pl i ci thus the leader must solve the original 
linear program 
as an alternative proof of theorem one may observe 
that it is known that finding a minimax strategy in a 
zerosum game is as hard as the linear programming problem 
and as we pointed out at the beginning of this section 
computing a minimax strategy in a zero-sum game is a special 
case of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy 
to commit to 
this polynomial-time solvability of the problem of 
computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in two-player 
normal-form games contrasts with the unknown complexity 
of computing a nash equilibrium in such games as well 
as with the np-hardness of finding a nash equilibrium with 
maximum utility for a given player in such games 
unfortunately this result does not generalize to more than 
two players-here the problem becomes np-hard to show 
this we reduce from the vertex-cover problem 
definition in vertex-cover we are given a graph 
g v e and an integer k we are asked whether there 
 
exists a subset of the vertices s ⊆ v with s k such 
that every edge e ∈ e has at least one of its endpoints in s 
balanced-vertex-cover is the special case of 
vertex-cover in which k v 
vertex-cover is np-complete the following 
lemma shows that the hardness remains if we require k 
 v similar results have been shown for other np-complete 
problems 
lemma balanced-vertex-cover is 
np-complete 
proof membership in np follows from the fact that 
the problem is a special case of vertex-cover which 
is in np to show np-hardness we reduce an arbitrary 
vertex-cover instance to a 
balanced-vertexcover instance as follows if for the vertex-cover 
instance k v then we simply add isolated vertices 
that are disjoint from the rest of the graph until k v 
if k v we add isolated triangles that is the 
complete graph on three vertices to the graph increasing k by 
 every time until k v 
theorem in -player normal-form games finding an 
optimal mixed strategy to commit to is np-hard 
proof we reduce an arbitrary 
balanced-vertexcover instance to the following -player normal-form game 
for every vertex v each of the three players has a pure 
strategy corresponding to that vertex rv sv tv respectively in 
addition for every edge e the third player has a pure 
strategy te and finally the third player has one additional pure 
strategy t the utilities are as follows 
 for all r ∈ r s ∈ s u r s t u r s t 
 for all r ∈ r s ∈ s t ∈ t− t u r s t u r s t 
 
 for all v ∈ v s ∈ s u rv s tv 
 for all v ∈ v r ∈ r u r sv tv 
 for all v ∈ v for all r ∈ r − rv s ∈ s − sv 
u r s tv v 
 v − 
 
 for all e ∈ e s ∈ s for both v ∈ e u rv s te 
 for all e ∈ e s ∈ s for all v ∈ e u rv s te v 
 v − 
 
 for all r ∈ r s ∈ s u r s t 
we note that players and have the same utility function 
we claim that there is an optimal strategy profile in which 
players and both obtain their maximum utility if 
and only if there is a solution to the 
balanced-vertexcover problem otherwise these players will both obtain 
 
first suppose there exists a solution to the 
balancedvertex-cover problem then let player play every 
rv such that v is in the cover with probability 
 v 
 and let 
player play every sv such that v is not in the cover with 
probability 
 v 
 then for player the expected utility 
of playing tv for any v is − 
 v 
 v 
 v − 
 because 
there is a chance of 
 v 
that rv or sv is played 
additionally the expected utility of playing te for any e is at most 
 − 
 v 
 v 
 v − 
 because there is a chance of at least 
 
 v 
that some rv with v ∈ e is played because player is 
randomizing over the pure strategies corresponding to the 
cover it follows that playing t is a best response for player 
 giving players and a utility of 
now suppose that players and obtain in optimal 
play then it must be the case that player plays t hence 
for every v ∈ v there must be a probability of at least 
 v 
that either rv or sv is played for otherwise player would 
be better off playing tv because players and have only 
a total probability of to distribute it must be the case 
that for each v either rv or sv is played with probability 
 
 v 
 and the other is played with probability it is not 
possible for both to have nonzero probability because then 
there would be some probability that both are played 
simultaneously correlation is not possible hence the total 
probability of at least one being played could not be high 
enough for all vertices thus for exactly half the v ∈ v 
player places probability 
 v 
on rv moreover for every 
e ∈ e there must be a probability of at least 
 v 
that some 
rv with v ∈ e is played for otherwise player would be 
better off playing te thus the v ∈ v such that player places 
probability 
 v 
on rv constitute a balanced vertex cover 
 bayesian games 
so far we have restricted our attention to normal-form 
games in a normal-form game it is assumed that every 
agent knows every other agent s preferences over the 
outcomes of the game in general however agents may have 
some private information about their preferences that is not 
known to the other agents moreover at the time of 
commitment to a strategy the agents may not even know their 
own final preferences over the outcomes of the game yet 
because these preferences may be dependent on a context 
that has yet to materialize for example when the code for 
a trading agent is written it may not yet be clear how that 
agent will value resources that it will negotiate over later 
because this depends on information that is not yet 
available at the time at which the code is written such as orders 
that will have been placed to the agent before the 
negotiation in this section we will study commitment in bayesian 
games which can model such uncertainty over preferences 
 definitions 
in a bayesian game every player i has a set of actions si 
a set of types θi with an associated probability distribution 
πi θi → and for each type θi a utility function 
uθi 
i s × s × × sn → r a pure strategy in a bayesian 
game is a mapping from the player s types to actions σi 
θi → si bayesian games can be rewritten in normal form 
by enumerating every pure strategy σi but this will cause 
an exponential blowup in the size of the representation of 
the game and therefore cannot lead to efficient algorithms 
the strategy that the leader should commit to depends 
on whether at the time of commitment the leader knows 
her own type if the leader does know her own type the 
other types that the leader might have had become 
irrelevant and the leader should simply commit to the strategy 
that is optimal for the type however as argued above the 
leader does not necessarily know her own type at the time of 
commitment e g the time at which the code is submitted 
in this case the leader must commit to a strategy that is 
 
dependent upon the leader s eventual type we will study 
this latter model although we will pay specific attention to 
the case where the leader has only a single type which is 
effectively the same as the former model 
 commitment to pure strategies 
it turns out that computing an optimal pure strategy to 
commit to is hard in bayesian games even with two players 
theorem finding an optimal pure strategy to commit 
to in -player bayesian games is np-hard even when the 
follower has only a single type 
proof we reduce an arbitrary vertex-cover 
instance to the following bayesian game between the leader 
and the follower the leader has k types θ θ θk 
each occurring with probability k and for every vertex 
v ∈ v the leader has an action sv the follower has only a 
single type for each edge e ∈ e the follower has an action 
te and the follower has a single additional action t the 
utility function for the leader is given by for all θl ∈ θl and 
all s ∈ s u 
θl 
l s t and for all e ∈ e u 
θl 
l s te 
the follower s utility is given by 
 for all v ∈ v for all e ∈ e with v ∈ e uf sv te 
 for all v ∈ v for all e ∈ e with v ∈ e uf sv te 
−k 
 for all v ∈ v uf sv t 
we claim that the leader can get a utility of if and only if 
there is a solution to the vertex-cover instance 
first suppose that there is a solution to the 
vertexcover instance then the leader can commit to a pure 
strategy such that for each vertex v in the cover the leader 
plays sv for some type then the follower s utility for 
playing te for any e ∈ e is at most k− 
k 
 
k 
 −k − 
k 
 
so that the follower will prefer to play t which gives the 
leader a utility of as required 
now suppose that there is a pure strategy for the leader 
that will give the leader a utility of then the follower 
must play t in order for the follower not to prefer playing te 
 for any e ∈ e instead for at least one v ∈ e the leader must 
play sv for some type θl hence the set of vertices v that the 
leader plays for some type must constitute a vertex cover 
and this set can have size at most k because the leader 
has only k types so there is a solution to the 
vertexcover instance 
however if the leader has only a single type then the 
problem becomes easy again types is the number of types 
for the follower 
theorem in -player bayesian games in which the 
leader has only a single type an optimal pure strategy to 
commit to can be found in o outcomes · types time 
proof for every leader action s we can compute for 
every follower type θf ∈ θf which actions t maximize the 
follower s utility call this set of actions brθf s then the 
utility that the leader receives for committing to action s 
can be computed as 
θf ∈θf 
π θf maxt∈brθf 
 s ul s t and 
the leader can choose the best action to commit to 
 commitment to mixed strategies 
in two-player zero-sum imperfect information games with 
perfect recall no player ever forgets something that it once 
knew a minimax strategy can be constructed in polynomial 
time unfortunately this result does not extend to 
computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to in the 
general-sum case-not even in bayesian games we will 
exhibit np-hardness by reducing from the 
independentset problem 
definition in independent-set we are given a 
graph g v e and an integer k we are asked whether 
there exists a subset of the vertices s ⊆ v with s k 
such that no edge e ∈ e has both of its endpoints in s 
again this problem is np-complete 
theorem finding an optimal mixed strategy to 
commit to in -player bayesian games is np-hard even when 
the leader has only a single type and the follower has only 
two actions 
proof we reduce an arbitrary independent-set 
instance to the following bayesian game between the leader 
and the follower the leader has only a single type and for 
every vertex v ∈ v the leader has an action sv the follower 
has a type θv for every v ∈ v occurring with probability 
 
 e v 
 and a type θe for every e ∈ e occurring with 
probability 
 e 
 the follower has two actions t and t 
the leader s utility is given by for all s ∈ s ul s t 
and ul s t the follower s utility is given by 
 for all v ∈ v uθv 
f sv t 
 for all v ∈ v and s ∈ s − sv uθv 
f s t k 
k− 
 
 for all v ∈ v and s ∈ s uθv 
f s t 
 for all e ∈ e s ∈ s uθe

we claim that an optimal strategy to commit to gives the 
leader an expected utility of at least e

if 
and only if there is a solution to the independent-set 
instance 
first suppose that there is a solution to the 
independent-set instance then the leader could 
commit to the following strategy for every vertex v in the 
independent set play the corresponding sv with probability 
 k if the follower has type θe for some e ∈ e the expected 
utility for the follower of playing t is at most 
k 
 k 
 
 
because there is at most one vertex v ∈ e such that sv is 
played with nonzero probability hence the follower will 
play t and obtain a utility of if the follower has type 
θv for some vertex v in the independent set the expected 
utility for the follower of playing t is k− 
k 
k 
k− 
 because 
the leader plays sv with probability k it follows that the 
follower who breaks ties to maximize the leader s utility 
will play t which also gives a utility of and gives the 
leader a higher utility hence the leader s expected utility 
for this strategy is at least e 
 e 
 k 
 e v 
 as required 
 
now suppose that there is a strategy that gives the leader 
an expected utility of at least e 
 e 
 k 
 e v 
 then this 
strategy must induce the follower to play t whenever it 
has a type of the form θe because otherwise the utility 
could be at most e −

 e v

 e v 
 thus it cannot be the case that for some edge 
e v v ∈ e the probability that the leader plays one of 
sv and sv is at least k because then the expected utility 
for the follower of playing t when it has type θe would be at 
least 
k 
 k 
 
 moreover the strategy must induce 
the follower to play t for at least k types of the form θv 
inducing the follower to play t when it has type θv can 
be done only by playing sv with probability at least k 
which will give the follower a utility of at most k− 
k 
k 
k− 
 
for playing t but then the set of vertices v such that sv 
is played with probability at least k must constitute an 
independent set of size k because if there were an edge e 
between two such vertices it would induce the follower to 
play t for type θe by the above 
by contrast if the follower has only a single type then we 
can generalize the linear programming approach for 
normalform games 
theorem in -player bayesian games in which the 
follower has only a single type an optimal mixed strategy 
to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear 
programming 
proof we generalize the approach in theorem as 
follows for every pure follower strategy t we compute a mixed 
strategy for the leader for every one of the leader s types 
such that playing t is a best response for the follower 
and under this constraint the mixed strategy maximizes 
the leader s ex ante expected utility to do so we generalize 
the linear program as follows 
maximize

π θl

for all θl ∈ θl 
s∈s

as in theorem the solution for the linear program that 
maximizes the solution value is an optimal strategy to 
commit to 
this shows an interesting contrast between commitment 
to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in 
bayesian games for pure strategies the problem becomes 
easy if the leader has only a single type but not if the 
follower has only a single type whereas for mixed strategies 
the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single 
type but not if the leader has only a single type 
 conclusions and future 
research 
in multiagent systems strategic settings are often 
analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their 
strategies simultaneously this requires some equilibrium 
notion nash equilibrium and its refinements and often 
leads to the equilibrium selection problem it is unclear to 
each individual player according to which equilibrium she 
should play however this model is not always realistic in 
many settings one player is able to commit to a strategy 
before the other player makes a decision for example one 
agent may arrive at the real or virtual site of the game 
before the other or in the specific case of software agents 
the code for one agent may be completed and committed 
before that of another agent such models are synonymously 
referred to as leadership commitment or stackelberg 
models and optimal play in such models is often significantly 
different from optimal play in the model where strategies 
are selected simultaneously specifically if commitment to 
mixed strategies is possible then optimal commitment 
never hurts the leader and often helps 
the recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic 
solutions has so far ignored leadership models with the 
exception of the interest in mechanism design where the 
designer is implicitly in a leadership position in this paper 
we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit 
to under both commitment to pure strategies and 
commitment to mixed strategies in both normal-form and bayesian 
games for normal-form games we showed that the optimal 
pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any 
number of players an optimal mixed strategy to commit 
to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two 
players using linear programming and no more efficiently 
than that in the sense that any linear program with a 
probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem this 
is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of 
minimax strategies in normal-form games the problem 
becomes np-hard for three or more players in bayesian 
games the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to 
commit to is np-hard even in two-player games in which the 
follower has only a single type although two-player games 
in which the leader has only a single type can be solved 
efficiently the problem of finding an optimal mixed 
strategy to commit to in a bayesian game is np-hard even in 
two-player games in which the leader has only a single type 
although two-player games in which the follower has only a 
single type can be solved efficiently using a generalization 
of the linear progamming approach for normal-form games

future research can take a number of directions first 
we can empirically evaluate the techniques presented here on 
test suites such as gamut we can also study the 
computation of optimal strategies to commit to in other 
 
concise representations of normal-form games-for example in 
graphical games or local-effect action graph games 
 for the cases where computing an optimal strategy to 
commit to is np-hard we can also study the computation 
of approximately optimal strategies to commit to while the 
correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in 
this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a 
strategy that if the following players play optimally performs 
almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this 
definition becomes problematic when we consider that the 
other players may also be playing only approximately 
optimally one may also study models in which multiple but 
not all players commit at the same time 
another interesting direction to pursue is to see if 
computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us 
in or otherwise shed light on computing nash equilibria 
often optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also nash 
equilibrium strategies for example in two-player zero-sum 
games this is always true although this is not always the 
case for example as we already pointed out sometimes the 
optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated 
strategy which can never be a nash equilibrium strategy
