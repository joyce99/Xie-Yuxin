abstract 
we consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in 
both time and frequency domains with the specific goal of 
identifying important and less-reported periodic and 
aperiodic words a set of words with identical trends can be 
grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely 
unsupervised manner the document frequency of each word 
across time is treated like a time series where each element 
is the document frequency - inverse document frequency 
 dfidf score at one time point in this paper we first 
applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different 
event characteristics important and less-reported periodic 
and aperiodic modeled aperiodic features with gaussian 
density and periodic features with gaussian mixture 
densities and subsequently detected each feature s burst by the 
truncated gaussian approach proposed an unsupervised 
greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic 
and periodic events all of the above methods can be 
applied to time series data in general we extensively 
evaluated our methods on the -year reuters news corpus and 
showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic 
and periodic events

 introduction 
there are more than online news sources in the 
world manually monitoring all of them for important events 
has become difficult or practically impossible in fact the 
topic detection and tracking tdt community has for many 
years been trying to come up with a practical solution to 
help people monitor news effectively unfortunately the 
holy grail is still elusive because the vast majority of tdt 
solutions proposed for event detection 
 are either too simplistic based on cosine similarity 
or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of 
parameters the ineffectiveness of current tdt 
technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of 
the many online news alerts services such as the 
industryleading google news alerts which generates more than 
 false alarms as further proof portals like yahoo 
take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine 
generated news alerts to go through a human operator for 
confirmation before sending them out to subscribers 
instead of attacking the problem with variations of the 
same hammer cosine similarity and tfidf a 
fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data 
is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in 
tdt thus in this paper we look at news stories and 
feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series 
word signal previous work like has attempted to 
reconstruct an event with its representative features however 
in many predictive event detection tasks i e retrospective 
event detection there is a vast set of potential features 
only for a fixed set of observations i e the obvious bursts 
of these features often only a small number are expected 
to be useful in particular we study the novel problem of 
analyzing feature trajectories for event detection 
borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing 
identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral 
analysis to evaluate our method we subsequently propose 
an unsupervised event detection algorithm for news streams

figure feature correlation dfidf time 
between a easter and april b unaudited and ended 
as an illustrative example consider the correlation 
between the words easter and april from the reuters 
corpus 
 from the plot of their normalized dfidf in figure 
 a we observe the heavy overlap between the two words 
circa which means they probably both belong to 
the same event during that time easter feast in this 
example the hidden event easter feast is a typical important 
aperiodic event over -year data another example is given 
by figure b where both the words unaudited and ended 
 
reuters corpus is the default dataset for all examples 
exhibit similar behaviour over periods of months these 
two words actually originated from the same periodic event 
net income-loss reports which are released quarterly by 
publicly listed companies 
other observations drawn from figure are the bursty 
period of april is much longer than easter which suggests 
that april may exist in other events during the same period 
 unaudited has a higher average dfidf value than ended 
which indicates unaudited to be more representative for the 
underlying event these two examples are but the tip of 
the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden 
in a news stream like reuters if a large number of them 
can be uncovered it could significantly aid tdt tasks in 
particular it indicates the significance of mining correlating 
features for detecting corresponding events to summarize 
we postulate that an event is described by its 
representative features a periodic event has a list of periodic 
features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic 
features representative features from the same event share 
similar distributions over time and are highly correlated 
an important event has a set of active largely reported 
representative features whereas an unimportant event has 
a set of inactive less-reported representative features 
a feature may be included by several events with overlaps 
in time frames based on these observations we can 
either mine representative features given an event or detect 
an event from a list of highly correlated features in this 
paper we focus on the latter i e how correlated features can 
be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner 
 contributions 
this paper has three main contributions 
 to the best of our knowledge our approach is the first 
to categorize word features for heterogenous events 
specifically every word feature is categorized into one 
of the following five feature types based on its power 
spectrum strength and periodicity hh high power 
and high long periodicity important aperiodic events 
 hl high power and low periodicity important 
periodic events lh low power and high periodicity 
unimportant aperiodic events ll low power and 
low periodicity non-events and sw stopwords 
a higher power and periodicity subset of ll comprising 
stopwords which contains no information 
 we propose a simple and effective mixture 
densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts 
 we come up with an unsupervised event detection 
algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events 
our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream 
to show its effectiveness 
 related work 
this work is largely motivated by a broader family of 
problems collectively known as topic detection and 
tracking tdt moreover most tdt 
research so far has been concerned with clustering classifying 
documents into topic types identifying novel sentences 
for new events etc without much regard to analyzing the 
word trajectory with respect to time swan and allan 
first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event 
however they only considered named entities and noun 
phrase pairs without considering their periodicities on the 
contrary our paper considers all of the above 
recently there has been significant interest in modeling 
an event in text streams as a burst of activities by 
incorporating temporal information kleinberg s seminal work 
described how bursty features can be extracted from text 
streams using an infinite automaton model which 
inspired a whole series of applications such as kumar s 
identification of bursty communities from weblog graphs mei s 
summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams 
he s clustering of text streams using bursty features etc 
nevertheless none of the existing work specifically identified 
features for events except for fung et al who clustered 
busty features to identify various bursty events our work 
differs from in several ways we analyze every 
single feature not only bursty features we classify features 
along two categorical dimensions periodicity and power 
yielding altogether five primary feature types we do not 
restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event 
spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by 
vlachos et al to identify periodicities and bursts from 
query logs their focus was on detecting multiple 
periodicities from the power spectrum graph which were then used 
to index words for query-by-burst search in this paper 
we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two 
dimensions namely periodicity and power spectrum with 
the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic 
bursty events 
 data representation 
let t be the duration period in days of a news stream 
and f represents the complete word feature space in the 
classical static vector space model vsm 
 event periodicity classification 
within t there may exist certain events that occur only 
once e g tony blair elected as prime minister of u k and 
other recurring events of various periodicities e g weekly 
soccer matches we thus categorize all events into two types 
aperiodic and periodic defined as follows 
definition aperiodic event an event is aperiodic 
within t if it only happens once 
definition periodic event if events of a certain event 
genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity p ≤ t we 
say that this particular event genre is periodic with each 
member event qualified as a periodic event 
note that the definition of aperiodic is relative i e it is 
true only for a given t and may be invalid for any other 
t t for example the event christmas feast is aperiodic 
for t ≤ but periodic for t ≥ 
 representative features 
intuitively an event can be described very concisely by 
a few discriminative and representative word features and 
vice-versa e g hurricane sweep and strike could be 
representative features of a hurricane genre event likewise 
a set of strongly correlated features could be used to 
reconstruct an event description assuming that strongly 
correlated features are representative the representation vector 
of a word feature is defined as follows 
definition feature trajectory the trajectory of a 
word feature f can be written as the sequence 
yf yf yf yf t 
where each element yf t is a measure of feature f at time t 
which could be defined using the normalized dfidf score 
yf t 
dff t 
n t 
× log 
n 
dff 
 
where dff t is the number of documents local df 
containing feature f at day t dff is the total number of 
documents global df containing feature f over t n t is the 
number of documents for day t and n is the total number 
of documents over t 
 identifying features for events 
in this section we show how representative features can 
be extracted for un important or a periodic events 
 spectral analysis for dominant period 
given a feature f we decompose its feature trajectory 
yf yf yf yf t into the sequence of t 
complex numbers x xt via the discrete fourier 
transform dft 
xk

yf t e− πi

where the fourier coefficient xk denotes the amplitude of 
the sinusoid with frequency k t 
the original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the 
dominant frequencies which can be determined from the 
power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator 
the periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of 
the fourier coefficients xk 
 
 k t which 
indicates the signal power at frequency k t in the spectrum 
from the power spectrum the dominant period is chosen as 
the inverse of the frequency with the highest power 
spectrum as follows 
definition dominant period the dominant period 
 dp of a given feature f is pf t arg max 
k 
xk 
 
 
accordingly we have 
definition dominant power spectrum the 
dominant power spectrum dps of a given feature f is 
sf xk 
 
 with xk 
 
≥ xj 
 
 ∀j k 
 categorizing features 
the dps of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its 
activeness at the specified frequency the higher the dps 
the more likely for the feature to be bursty combining dps 
with dp we therefore categorize all features into four types 
 
we normalize yf t as yf t yf t t 
i yf i so that it 
could be interpreted as a probability 
 hh high sf aperiodic or long-term periodic pf 
t 
 hl high sf short-term periodic pf ≤ t 
 lh low sf aperiodic or long-term periodic 
 ll low sf short-term periodic 
the boundary between long-term and short-term periodic 
is set to t however distinguishing between a high and 
low dps is not straightforward which will be tackled later 
properties of different feature sets 
to better understand the properties of hh hl lh and ll 
we select four features christmas soccer dbs and your as 
illustrative examples since the boundary between high and 
low power spectrum is unclear these chosen examples have 
relative wide range of power spectrum values figure a 
shows the dfidf trajectory for christmas with a distinct 
burst around christmas day for the -year reuters dataset 
christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with 
pf and sf as shown in figure b clearly 
the value of sf is reasonable for a well-known 
bursty event like christmas 
 
 
 
 
 
 a christmas dfidf time 
 
 
 
 
 
p s 
 b christmas s frequency 
figure feature christmas with relative high sf 
and long-term pf 
the dfidf trajectory for soccer is shown in figure a 
from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 
 days which is again verified by its computed value of pf 
 as shown in figure b using the domain knowledge 
that soccer games have more matches every saturday which 
makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event we 
thus consider the value of sf to be high 
 
 
 
 
 
 a soccer dfidf time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p s 
 b soccer s frequency 
figure feature soccer with relative high sf and 
short-term pf 
from the dfidf trajectory for dbs in figure a we 
can immediately deduce dbs to be an infrequent word with 
a trivial burst on corresponding to dbs land 
raﬄes holdings plans this is confirmed by the long period 
of pf and low power of sf as shown in 
figure b moreover since this aperiodic event is only 
reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few 
days we therefore say that its low power value of sf 
 is representative of unimportant events 
the most confusing example is shown in figure for the 
word feature your which looks very similar to the graph for 
soccer in figure at first glance we may be tempted to 
group both your and soccer into the same category of hl or 
ll since both distributions look similar and have the same 
dominant period of approximately a week however further 
 
 
 
 
 
 a dbs dfidf time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p s 
 b dbs s frequency 
figure feature dbs with relative low sf and 
long-term pf 
analysis indicates that the periodicity of your is due to the 
differences in document counts for weekdays average 
per day and weekends 
 average per day one would 
have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to 
be a day moreover despite our dfidf normalization the 
weekday weekend imbalance still prevailed stopwords 
occur times more frequently on weekends than on weekdays 
thus the dps remains the only distinguishing factor 
between your sf and soccer sf however 
it is very dangerous to simply conclude that a power value 
of s corresponds to a stopword feature

figure feature your as an example confusing 
with feature soccer 
before introducing our solution to this problem let s look 
at another ll example as shown in figure for beenb which 
is actually a confirmed typo we therefore classify beenb as a 
noisy feature that does not contribute to any event clearly 
the trajectory of your is very different from beenb which 
means that the former has to be considered separately

stop words sw feature set 
based on the above analysis we realize that there must be 
another feature set between hl and ll that corresponds to 
the set of stopwords features from this set has moderate 
dps and low but known dominant period since it is hard 
to distinguish this feature set from hl and ll only based 
on dps we introduce another factor called average dfidf 
 dfidf as shown in figure features like your usually 
have a lower dps than a hl feature like soccer but have 
a much higher dfidf than another ll noisy feature such 
as beenb since such properties are usually characteristics 
of stopwords we group features like your into the newly 
defined stopword sw feature set 
since setting the dps and dfidf thresholds for 
identifying stopwords is more of an art than science we proposed 
a heuristic hs algorithm algorithm the basic idea is to 
only use news stories from weekdays to identify stopwords 
 
the weekends here also include public holidays falling on 
weekdays 
the sw set is initially seeded with a small set of popular 
stopwords utilized by google search engine 
algorithm heuristic stopwords detection hs 
input seed sw set weekday trajectories of all words 
 from the seed set sw compute the maximum dps as 
udps maximum dfidf as udfidf and minimum 
of dfidf as ldfidf 
 for fi ∈ f do 
 compute dft for fi 
 if sfi ≤ udps and dfidffi ∈ 
 ldfidf udfidf then 
 fi → sw 
 f f − fi 
 end if 
 end for 
overview of feature categorization 
after the sw set is generated all stopwords are removed 
from f we then set the boundary between high and low 
dps to be the upper bound of the sw set s dps an overview 
of all five feature sets is shown in figure 
figure the feature sets for events 
 identifying bursts for features 
since only features from hh hl and lh are 
meaningful and could potentially be representative to some events 
we pruned all other feature classified as ll or sw in this 
section we describe how bursts can be identified from the 
remaining features unlike kleinberg s burst identification 
algorithm we can identify both significant and trivial 
bursts without the need to set any parameters 
 detecting aperiodic features bursts 
for each feature in hh and hl we truncate its 
trajectory by keeping only the bursty period which is modeled 
with a gaussian distribution for example figure shows 
the word feature iraq with a burst circa 
being modeled as a gaussian its bursty period is defined by 
 μf − σf μf σf as shown in figure b 
 detecting periodic features bursts

each gaussian represents one periodic event and is modeled 
similarly as mentioned in section 
 events from features 
after identifying and modeling bursts for all features the 
next task is to paint a picture of the event with a potential 
set of representative features 
 feature correlation 
if two features fi and fj are representative of the same 
event they must satisfy the following necessary conditions 
 fi and fj are identically distributed yfi ∼ yfj 
 fi and fj have a high document overlap 
measuring feature distribution similarity 
we measure the similarity between two features fi and fj 
using discrete kl-divergence defined as follows 
definition feature similarity kl fi fj is given by 
max kl fi fj kl fj fi where 
kl fi fj 
t 
t 
f yfi t θfi log 
f yfi t θfi 
f yfj t θfj 
 
since kl-divergence is not symmetric we define the 
similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of kl fi fj 
and kl fj fi further the similarity between two 
aperiodic features can be computed using a closed form of the 
kl-divergence the same discrete kl-divergence 
formula of eq is employed to compute the similarity between 
two periodic features 
next we define the overal similarity among a set of 
features r using the maximum inter-feature kl-divergence 
value as follows 
definition set s similarity kl r max 
∀fi fj ∈r 
kl fi fj 
document overlap 
let mi be the set of all documents containing feature fi 
given two features fi and fj the overlapping document set 
containing both features is mi ∩ mj intuitively the higher 
the mi ∩ mj the more likelty that fi and fj will be highly 
correlated we define the degree of document overlap 
between two features fi and fj as follows 
definition feature df overlap d fi fj 
 mi∩mj 
min mi mj 
 
accordingly the df overlap among a set of features r is 
also defined 
definition set df overlap d r min 
∀fi fj ∈r 
d fi fj 
 unsupervised greedy event detection 
we use features from hh to detect important aperiodic 
events features from lh to detect less-reported unimportant 
aperiodic events and features from hl to detect periodic 
events all of them share the same algorithm given bursty 
feature fi ∈ hh the goal is to find highly correlated 
features from hh the set of features similar to fi can then 
collectively describe an event specifically we need to find a 
subset ri of hh that minimizes the following cost function 
c ri 
kl ri 
d ri fj ∈ri 
sfj 
 ri ⊂ hh 
the underlying event e associated with the burst of fi can 
be represented by ri as 
y e 
fj ∈ri 
sfj 
fu∈ri 
sfu 
yfj 
the burst analysis for event e is exactly the same as the 
feature trajectory 
the cost in eq can be minimized using our 
unsupervised greedy ug event detection algorithm which is 
described in algorithm the ug algorithm allows a feature

 end for 
to be contained in multiple events so that we can detect 
several events happening at the same time furthermore trivial 
events only containing year month features i e an event 
only containing feature aug could be identified over a 
 year news stream could be removed although such events 
will have inherent high cost and should already be ranked 
very low note that our ug algorithm only requires one 
data-dependant parameter the boundary between high and 
low power spectrum to be set once and this parameter can 
be easily estimated using the hs algorithm algorithm 
 experiments 
in this section we study the performances of our feature 
categorizing method and event detection algorithm we first 
introduce the dataset and experimental setup then we 
subjectively evaluate the categorization of features for hh hl 
lh ll and sw finally we study the a periodic event 
detection problem with algorithm 
 dataset and experimental setup 
the reuters corpus contains english news stories

 of the open source lucene software was used to tokenize 
the news text content and generate the document-word 
vector in order to preserve the time-sensitive past present future 
tenses of verbs and the differences between lower case nouns 
and upper case named entities no stemming was done since 
dynamic stopword removal is one of the functionalities of 
our method no stopword was removed we did remove 
nonenglish characters however after which the number of word 
features amounts to all experiments were 
implemented in java and conducted on a ghz pentium pc 
running windows server with gb of memory 
 categorizing features 
we downloaded well-known stopwords utilized by the 
google search engine as our seed training features which 
includes a about an are as at be by de for from how 
in is it of on or that the this to was what when 
where who will with la com und en and www we 
excluded the last five stopwords as they are uncommon in news 
stories by only analyzing news stories over weekdays 
we computed the upper bound of the power spectrum for 
stopwords at and corresponding dfidf ranges from 
 to any feature f satisfying sf 
and dfidff over weekdays will be 
considered a stopword in this manner stopwords were 
found and removed as visualized in figure some detected 
stopwords are a p s dfidf at

dfidf after the removal of these stopwords 
the distribution of weekday and weekend news are more or 
less matched and in the ensuing experiments we shall make 
use of the full corpus weekdays and weekends

between high and low periodicity was set to

figure distribution of categorized features over 
the four quadrants shading in log scale 
following observations 
 most features have low s and are easily distinguishable 
from those features having a much higher s which 
allows us to detect important a periodic events from 
trivial events by selecting features with high s 
 features in the hh and lh quadrants are aperiodic 
which are nicely separated big horizontal gap from 
the periodic features this allows reliably detecting 
aperiodic events and periodic events independently 
 the vertical boundary between high and low power 
spectrum is not as clearcut and the exact value will be 
application specific 
by checking the scatter distribution of features from sw on 
hh hl lh and ll as shown in figure we found that 
 of the detected stopwords originated from 
ll the ll classification and high dfidf scores of 
stopwords agree with the generally accepted notion that 
stopwords are equally frequent over all time therefore setting 
the boundary between high and low power spectrum using 
the upper bound sf of sw is a reasonable heuristic 
 detecting aperiodic events 
we shall evaluate our two hypotheses important 
aperiodic events can be defined by a set of hh features and 
 less reported aperiodic events can be defined by a set of 
lh features since no benchmark news streams exist for 
event detection tdt datasets are not proper streams we 
evaluate the quality of the automatically detected events by 
comparing them to manually-confirmed events by searching 
through the corpus 
among the hh features we detected important 
aperiodic events as shown in table e − e note that the 
entire identification took less than second after 
removing events containing only the month feature among the 
 events other than the overlaps between e and e both 
describes the same hostage event e and e both about 
company reports the identified events are extremely 
accurate and correspond very well to the major events of the 
period for example the defeat of bob dole election of 
tony blair missile attack on iraq etc recall that selecting 
the features for one event should minimize the cost in eq 
 such that the number of features span different events 
and not all features relevant to an event will be selected 
e g the feature clinton is representative to e but since 
clinton relates to many other events its time domain signal 
is far different from those of other representative features like 
dole and bob the number of documents of a detected event 
is roughly estimated by the number of indexed documents 
containing the representative features we can see that all 
 important aperiodic events are popularly reported events 
after minutes of computation time we detected 
less reported aperiodic events from lh features 
table lists the top detected aperiodic events e − e 
with respect to the cost we found that these events are 
actually very trivial events with only a few news reports 
and are usually subsumed by some larger topics for 
example e is one of the rescue events in an airplane hijack 
topic one advantage of our ug algorithm for discovering 
less-reported aperiodic events is that we are able to precisely 
detect the true event period 
 detecting periodic events 
among the hl features important periodic 
events were detected within minutes of computing time 
table lists the top detected periodic events with respect 
to the cost e − e all of the detected periodic events 
are indeed valid and correspond to real life periodic events 
the gmm model is able to detect and estimate the bursty 
period nicely although it cannot distinguish the slight 
difference between every monday-friday and all weekdays as 
shown in e we also notice that e is actually a subset 
of e soccer game which is acceptable since the sheffield 
league results are announced independently every weekend 
 conclusions 
this paper took a whole new perspective of analyzing 
feature trajectories as time domain signals by 
considering the word document frequencies in both time and 
frequency domains we were able to derive many new 
characteristics about news streams that were previously unknown 
e g the different distributions of stopwords during 
weekdays and weekends for the first time in the area of tdt 
we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect 
important and less-reported periodic and aperiodic events 
the key idea of our work lies in the observations that 
 a periodic events have a periodic representative features 
and un important events have in active representative 
features differentiated by their power spectrums and time 
periods to address the real event detection problem a simple 
and effective mixture density-based approach was used to 
identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods 
we also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to 
detect both aperiodic and periodic events which was successful 
in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real 
news stream 
although we have not made any benchmark comparison 
against another approach simply because there is no 
previous work in the addressed problem future work includes 
evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news 
stream and comparing our model against the closest 
equivalent methods which currently are limited to the methods of 
kleinberg which can only detect certain type of bursty 
events depending on parameter settings fung et al and 
swan and allan nevertheless we believe our simple 
and effective method will be useful for all tdt 
practitioners and will be especially useful for the initial exploratory 
analysis of news streams
