abstract 
we derive optimal bidding strategies for a global bidding 
agent that participates in multiple simultaneous second-price 
auctions with perfect substitutes we first consider a model 
where all other bidders are local and participate in a single 
auction for this case we prove that assuming free 
disposal the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in 
all available auctions irrespective of the local bidders 
valuation distribution furthermore for non-decreasing valuation 
distributions we prove that the problem of finding the 
optimal bids reduces to two dimensions these results hold both 
in the case where the number of local bidders is known and 
when this number is determined by a poisson distribution 
this analysis extends to online markets where typically 
auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially in addition 
by combining analytical and simulation results we 
demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global 
bidders provided that the market consists of both global and 
local bidders finally we address the efficiency of the overall 
market and show that information about the number of 
local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which 
a global bidder affects efficiency

 introduction 
the recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted 
in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or 
even identical goods and services in ebay alone for 
example there are often hundreds or sometimes even 
thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such 
substitutable items 
 against this background it is essential 
to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use 
to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions to 
this end in this paper we devise and analyse optimal 
bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting 
- namely an agent that participates in multiple 
concurrent i e simultaneous second-price auctions for goods that 
are perfect substitutes as we will show however this 
analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are 
conducted sequentially as well as concurrently 
to date much of the existing literature on multiple 
auctions focuses either on sequential auctions or on 
simultaneous auctions for complementary goods where the value of 
items together is greater than the sum of the individual items 
 see section for related research on simultaneous auctions 
in contrast here we consider bidding strategies for markets 
with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes 
in particular our focus is on vickrey or second-price sealed 
bid auctions we choose these because they require little 
communication and are well known for their capacity to 
induce truthful bidding which makes them suitable for many 
multi-agent system settings however our results generalise 
to settings with english auctions since these are strategically 
equivalent to second-price auctions within this setting we 
are able to characterise for the first time a bidder s 
utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any 
number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation 
distribution in more detail we first consider a market where a 
single bidder called the global bidder can bid in any number 
of auctions whereas the other bidders called the local 
bidders are assumed to bid only in a single auction for this 
case we find the following results 
 whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a 
bidder s best strategy is to bid its true value the best 
strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it 
 we are able to prove that even if a global bidder 
requires only one item the expected utility is maximised 
by participating in all the auctions that are selling the 
desired item 
 finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an 
arduous task when considering all possible combinations 
however for most common bidder valuation 
distributions we are able to significantly reduce this search 
space and thus the computation required 
 empirically we find that a bidder s expected utility 
is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the 
auctions and equal or lower in all other auctions 
we then go on to consider markets with more than one global 
bidder due to the complexity of the problem we combine 
analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to 
numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy by so doing 
we find that in a market with only global bidders the 
dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure 
strategy in fact it fluctuates between two states if the market 
consists of both local and global bidders however the global 
bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we 
approximate a symmetric nash equilibrium 
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows 
section discusses related work in section we describe the 
bidders and the auctions in more detail in section we 
investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise 
the optimal bidding behaviour for it section considers the 
case with multiple global bidders and in section we address 
the market efficiency finally section concludes 
 related work 
research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be 
segmented along two broad lines on the one hand there is the 
game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of 
simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium 
strategy of rational agents such 
analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in 
the concurrent auctions is the same e g there are m 
vickrey auctions or m first-price auctions on the other hand 
heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex 
settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or 
the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed 
auctions this paper adopts the former approach in 
studying a market of m simultaneous vickrey auctions since 
this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies 
in this case the seminal paper by engelbrecht-wiggans 
and weber provides one of the starting points for the 
gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have 
substitutable goods their work analyses a market 
consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for 
a dresser thus the couple s bid space can at most contain 
two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two 
geographically distributed auctions simultaneously they 
derive a mixed strategy nash equilibrium for the special case 
where the number of buyers is large our analysis differs 
from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which 
bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can 
bid in all the auctions concurrently which is entirely possible 
given autonomous agents 
following this then studied the case of simultaneous 
auctions with complementary goods they analyse the case 
of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding 
of the buyers and resultant market efficiency the setting 
provided in is further extended to the case of common 
values in however neither of these works extend easily to 
the case of substitutable goods which we consider this case 
is studied in but the scenario considered is restricted 
to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder 
having the same value and thereby knowing the value of 
other bidders the space of symmetric mixed equilibrium 
strategies is derived for this special case but again our result 
is more general finally considers the case of concurrent 
english auctions in which he develops bidding algorithms for 
buyers with different risk attitudes however he forces the 
bids to be the same across auctions which we show in this 
paper not always to be optimal 
 bidding in multiple auctions 
the model consists of m sellers each of whom acts as an 
auctioneer each seller auctions one item these items are 
complete substitutes i e they are equal in terms of value 
and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more 
than one item the m auctions are executed concurrently 
that is they end simultaneously and no information about 
the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until 
the bids are placed 
 however we briefly address markets 
with both sequential and concurrent auctions in section 
we also assume that all the auctions are equivalent i e a 
bidder does not prefer one auction over another finally we 
assume free disposal i e a winner of multiple items incurs 
no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones and risk 
neutral bidders 
 the auctions 
the seller s auction is implemented as a vickrey auction 
where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest 
price this format has several advantages for an agent-based 
setting firstly it is communication efficient secondly for 
the single-auction case i e where a bidder places a bid in 
at most one auction the optimal strategy is to bid the true 
value and thus requires no computation once the valuation 
of the item is known this strategy is also weakly dominant 
 i e it is independent of the other bidders decisions and 
therefore it requires no information about the preferences of 
other agents such as the distribution of their valuations 
 global and local bidders 
we distinguish between global and local bidders the former 
can bid in any number of auctions whereas the latter only bid 
in a single one local bidders are assumed to bid according to 
the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation 
 
we consider two ways of modelling local bidders static and 
dynamic in the first model the number of local bidders 
is assumed to be known and equal to n for each auction 
in the latter model on the other hand the average number 
of bidders is equal to n but the exact number is unknown 
and may vary for each auction this uncertainty is modelled 
using a poisson distribution more details are provided in 
section 
as we will later show a global bidder who bids optimally 
has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder even 
though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only 
requires one of them however we can identify a number of 
compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid 
globally firstly participation costs such as entry fees and 
time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 
 
although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions where 
this is the case the conditions are similar for last-minute 
bidding in english auctions such as ebay 
 
note that since bidding the true value is optimal for local 
bidders irrespective of what others are bidding their strategy 
is not affected by the presence of global bidders 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
participate in auctions that they are already familiar with 
secondly bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions 
selling the same type of item even if this is known 
however additional information such as the distribution of the 
valuations of other bidders and the number of participating 
bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple 
auctions this lack of expert information often drives a novice 
to bid locally thirdly an optimal global strategy is harder 
to compute than a local one an agent with bounded 
rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such 
a strategy lastly even though a global bidder profits on 
average such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently 
winning multiple auctions this deters bidders who are 
either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating 
in multiple auction as a result in most market places we 
expect a combination of global and local bidders 
in view of the above considerations human buyers are 
more likely to bid locally the global strategy however can 
be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can 
gather data from many auctions and perform the required 
calculations within the desired time frame 
 a single global bidder 
in this section we provide a theoretical analysis of the 
optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder given that all other 
bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation 
after we describe the global bidder s expected utility in 
section we show in section that it is always optimal for 
a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of 
auctions available in section we discuss how to 
significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for 
the multi-auction problem and we then apply these methods 
to find optimal strategies for specific examples finally in 
section we extend our analysis to sequential auctions 
 the global bidder s expected utility 
in what follows the number of sellers auctions is m ≥ and 
the number of local bidders is n ≥ a bidder s valuation 
v ∈ vmax is randomly drawn from a cumulative 
distribution f with probability density f where f is continuous 
strictly positive and has support vmax f is assumed to 
be equal and common knowledge for all bidders a global 
bid b is a set containing a bid bi ∈ vmax for each auction 
 ≤ i ≤ m the bids may be different for different auctions 
for ease of exposition we introduce the cumulative 
distribution function for the first-order statistics g b f b n 
∈ 
 denoting the probability of winning a specific auction 
conditional on placing bid b in this auction and its 
probability density g b dg b db nf b n− 
f b now the 
expected utility u for a global bidder with global bid b and 
valuation v is given by 
u b v v 
⎡ 
⎣ − 
bi∈b 
 − g bi 
⎤ 
⎦ − 
bi∈b 
bi 
 
yg y dy 
here the left part of the equation is the valuation 
multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at 
least one of the m auctions and thus corresponds to the 
expected benefit in more detail note that − g bi is 
the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi 
bi∈b − g bi is the probability of not winning any 
auction and thus − bi∈b − g bi is the probability of 
winning at least one auction the right part of equation 
corresponds to the total expected costs or payments to see 
the latter note that the expected payment of a single 
secondprice auction when bidding b equals 
b 
 
yg y dy see and 
is independent of the expected payments for other auctions 
clearly equation applies to the model with static local 
bidders i e where the number of bidders is known and equal 
for each auction see section however we can use the 
same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the 
following way 
lemma by replacing the first-order statistic g y with 
ˆg y en f y − 
 
and the corresponding density function g y with ˆg y 
d ˆg y dy n f y en f y − 
 equation becomes the 
expected utility where the number of local bidders in each 
auction is described by a poisson distribution with average n 
 i e where the probability that n local bidders participate 
is given by p n nn 
e−n 
 n 
proof to prove this we first show that g · and f · can 
be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is 
given by a binomial distribution where a bidder s decision 
to participate is given by a bernoulli trial as follows 
g y f y n 
 − p p f y n 
 
where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the 
auction and n is the total number of bidders to see this 
note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero as 
a result f − p since there is a − p probability 
that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction and f y 
f p f y since there is a probability p that a bidder 
bids according to the original distribution f y now the 
average number of participating bidders is given by n p n 
by replacing p with n n equation becomes g y − 
n n n n f y n 
 note that a poisson distribution is 
given by the limit of a binomial distribution by keeping 
n constant and taking the limit n → ∞ we then obtain 
g y en f y − 
 ˆg y this concludes our proof 
the results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic 
model unless stated otherwise 
 participation in multiple auctions 
we now show that for any valuation v vmax a 
utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids 
in all available auctions to prove this we show that the 
expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid 
compared to not participating in an auction more formally 
theorem consider a global bidder with valuation 
v vmax and global bid b where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ b 
suppose b contains no bid for auction j ∈ m 
then there exists a bj such that u b∪ bj v u b v 
proof using equation the marginal expected utility for 
participating in an additional auction can be written as 
u b ∪ bj v − u b v vg bj 
bi∈b 
 − g bi − 
bj 
 
yg y dy 
now using integration by parts we have 
bj 
 
yg y bjg bj − 
bj 
 
g y dy and the above equation can be rewritten as 
u b ∪ bj v − u b v 
g bj 
⎡ 
⎣v 
bi∈b 
 − g bi − bj 
⎤ 
⎦ 
bj 
 
g y dy 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
let bj where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive 
value clearly g bj and 
bj 
 
g y dy are then both strictly 
positive since f y moreover given that bi ≤ v 
vmax for bi ∈ b and that v it follows that v bi∈b − 
g bi now suppose bj 
 
v bi∈b − g bi then 
u b ∪ bj v − u b v g bj 
 
v bi∈b − g bi 
bj 
 
g y dy and thus u b ∪ bj v u b v this 
completes our proof 
 the optimal global bid 
a general solution to the optimal global bid requires the 
maximisation of equation in m dimensions an arduous task 
even when applying numerical methods in this section 
however we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two 
dimensions in most cases one continuous and one discrete 
thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand first 
however in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 
we set the partial derivatives to zero 
∂u 
∂bi 
 g bi 
⎡ 
⎣v 
bj ∈b\ bi 
 − g bj − bi 
⎤ 
⎦ 
now equality holds either when g bi or when 
bj ∈b\ bi − g bj v − bi in the dynamic model 
g bi is always greater than zero and can therefore be 
ignored since g nf e−n 
and we assume f y 
in the static model g bi only when bi 
however theorem shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 
 v vmax therefore we can ignore the first part and 
the second part yields 
bi v 
bj ∈b\ bi 
 − g bj 
in other words the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the 
bidder s valuation multiplied by the probability of not 
winning any of the other auctions it is straightforward to show 
that the second partial derivative is negative confirming that 
the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids 
constant thus equation provides a means to derive the 
optimal bid for auction i given the bids in all other auctions 
 reducing the search space 
in what follows we show that for non-decreasing 
probability density functions such as the uniform and logarithmic 
distributions the optimal global bid consists of at most two 
different values for any m ≥ that is the search space 
for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two 
continuous values let these values be bhigh and blow where 
bhigh ≥ blow more formally 
theorem suppose the probability density function f is 
non-decreasing within the range vmax then the following 
proposition holds given v for any bi ∈ b either bi 
bhigh bi blow or bi bhigh blow 
proof using equation we can produce m equations one 
for each auction with m unknowns now by combining 
these equations we obtain the following relationship b − 
g b b − g b bm − g bm by defining 
h b b − g b we can rewrite the equation to 
h b h b h bm v 
bj ∈b 
 − g bj 
in order to prove that there exist at most two different bids 
it is sufficient to show that b h− 
 y has at most two 
solutions that satisfy ≤ b ≤ vmax for any y to see this 
suppose h− 
 y has two solutions but there exists a third 
bid bj blow bhigh from equation it then follows that 
there exists a y such that h bj h blow h bhigh y 
therefore h− 
 y must have at least three solutions which 
is a contradiction 
now note that in order to prove that h− 
 y has at most 
two solutions it is necessary and sufficient to show that h b 
has at most one local maximum for ≤ b ≤ vmax a 
sufficient conditions however is for h b to be strictly concave 
 
the function h is strictly concave if and only if the following 
condition holds 
h b 
d 
db 
 − b · g b − g b − b 
dg 
db 
 g b 
 
where h b d 
h db 
 by performing standard 
calculations we obtain the following condition for the static model 
b n − 
f b 
f b 
 n 
f b 
f b 
 − for ≤ b ≤ vmax 
and similarly for the dynamic model we have 
b n f b 
f b 
f b 
 − for ≤ b ≤ vmax 
where f b df db since both f and f are positive 
conditions and clearly hold for f b ≥ in other 
words conditions and show that h b is strictly 
concave when the probability density function is non-decreasing 
for ≤ b ≤ vmax completing our proof 
note from conditions and that the requirement of 
non-decreasing density functions is sufficient but far from 
necessary moreover condition requiring h b to be strictly 
concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two 
solutions as a result in practice we find that the reduction 
of the search space applies to most cases 
given there are at most possible bids blow and bhigh we 
can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in 
terms of the other suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in 
mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining mhigh m−mlow 
auctions equation then becomes 
blow v − g blow mlow− 
 − g bhigh mhigh 
 
and can be rearranged to give 
bhigh g− 
 − 
blow 
v − g blow mlow− 
 
mhigh 
 
here the inverse function g− 
 · can usually be obtained 
quite easily furthermore note that if mlow or mhigh 
 equation can be used directly to find the desired value 
using the above we are able to reduce the bid search space 
to a single continuous dimension given mlow or mhigh 
however we do not know the number of auctions in which to bid 
blow and bhigh and thus we need to search m different 
combinations to find the optimal global bid moreover for each 
 
more precisely h b can be either strictly convex or strictly 
concave however it is easy to see that h is not convex since 
h h vmax and h b ≥ for b vmax

 empirical evaluation 
in this section we present results from an empirical study 
and characterise the optimal global bid for specific cases 
furthermore we measure the actual utility improvement that 
can be obtained when using the global strategy the results 
presented here are based on a uniform distribution of the 
valuations with vmax and the static local bidder model but 
they generalise to the dynamic model and other distributions 
 not shown due to space limitations figure illustrates 
the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected 
utility for various m and n but again the bid curves for 
different values of m and n follow a very similar pattern 
here the bid is normalised by the valuation v to give the bid 
fraction x b v note that when x a bidder bids its 
true value 
as shown in figure for bidders with a relatively low 
valuation the optimal strategy is to submit m equal bids 
at or very close to the true value the optimal bid fraction 
then gradually decreases for higher valuations interestingly 
in most cases placing equal bids is no longer the optimal 
strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point a 
socalled pitchfork bifurcation is then observed and the optimal 
bids split into two values a single high bid and m − low 
ones this transition is smooth for m but exhibits an 
abrupt jump for m ≥ in all experiments however we 
consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to 
place a high bid in one auction and an equal or lower bid in 
all others in case of a bifurcation and when the valuation 
approaches vmax the optimal high bid goes to the true value 
and the low bids go to zero 
as illustrated in figure the utility of a global bidder 
becomes progressively higher with more auctions in absolute 
terms the improvement is especially high for bidders that 
have an above average valuation but not too close to vmax 
the bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding 
globally this is because bidders with very low valuations 
have a very small chance of winning any auction whereas 
bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of 
winning a single auction and benefit less from participating 
in more auctions in contrast if we consider the utility 
relative to bidding in a single auction this is much higher for 
bidders with relatively low valuations this effect cannot be 
seen clearly in figure due to the scale in particular we 
notice that a global bidder with a low valuation can improve 
its utility by up to m times the expected utility of bidding 
locally intuitively this is because the chance of winning one 
of the auctions increases by up to a factor m whereas the 
increase in the expected cost is negligible for high valuation 
buyers however the benefit is not that obvious because the 
chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single 
auction 
 sequential and concurrent auctions 
in this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding 
strategy to sequential auctions specifically the auction 
process consists of r rounds and in each round any number of 
auctions are running simultaneously such a combination of 
sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in 
practice especially online 
 it turns out that the analysis for 
the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can 
be easily extended to include sequential auctions in the 
following the number of simultaneous auctions in round r is 
denoted by mr and the set of bids in that round by br as 
before the analysis assumes that all other bidders are local 
and bid in a single auction furthermore we assume that the 
global bidders have complete knowledge about the number 
of rounds and the number of auctions in each round 
the expected utility in round r denoted by ur is similar to 
before equation in section except that now additional 
benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired 
item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous 
auctions for convenience ur br mr is abbreviated to ur 
in the following the expected utility thus becomes 
ur v · pr br − 
bri∈br 
bri 
 
yg y dy ur · − pr br 
 ur v − ur pr br − 
bri∈br 
bri 
 
yg y dy 
where pr br − bri∈br 
 − g bri is the probability of 
winning at least one auction in round r now we take the 
partial derivative of equation in order to find the optimal 
bid brj for auction j in round r

∂brj

⎣ v − us

rather than being purely sequential in nature online 
auctions also often overlap i e new auctions can start while 
others are still ongoing in that case however it is optimal 
to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome 
of the earlier auctions is known thereby reducing the chance 
of unwittingly winning multiple items using this strategy 
overlapping auctions effectively become sequential and can 
thus be analysed using the results in this section 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
note that equation is almost identical to equation in 
section except that the valuation v is now replaced by 
v−ur the optimal bidding strategy can thus be found by 
backward induction where ur using the procedure 
outlined in section 
 multiple global bidders 
as argued in section we expect a real-world market to 
exhibit a mix of global and local bidders whereas so far we 
assumed a single global bidder in this section we consider a 
setting where multiple global bidders interact with one 
another and with local bidders as well the analysis of this 
problem is complex however as the optimal bidding 
strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global 
bidders a typical analytical approach is to find the 
symmetric nash equilibrium solution which occurs when all 
global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids 
and no global bidder has any incentive to unilaterally 
deviate from the chosen strategy due to the complexity of the 
problem however here we combine a computational 
simulation approach with analytical results the simulation works 
by iteratively finding the best response to the optimal 
bidding strategies in the previous iteration if this should result 
in a stable outcome i e when the optimal bidding 
strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations the 
solution is by definition a symmetric nash equilibrium 
 the global bidder s expected utility 
in order to find a global bidder s best response we first need 
to calculate the expected utility given the global bid b and 
the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the 
local bidders in the following let ng denote the number of 
other global bidders furthermore let the strategies of the 
other global bidders be represented by the set of functions 
βk v ≤ k ≤ m producing a bid for each auction given a 
bidder s valuation v note that all other global bidders use 
the same set of functions since we consider symmetric 
equilibria however we assume that the assignment of functions 
to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion 
without replacement i e each function is assigned exactly 
once by each global bidder let ω denote the set of all 
possible assignments each such assignment ω ∈ ω is a m ng 
matrix where each entry ωi j identifies the function used by 
global bidder j in auction i note that the cardinality of ω 
denoted by ω is equal to m ng 
 now the expected utility 
is the average expected utility over all possible assignments 
and is given by 
u b v 
 
 ω ω∈ω

where ˜gωi b g b · 
ng

b 
 
βωi j y f y dy denotes the 
probability of winning auction i given that each global 
bidder ≤ j ≤ ng bids according to the function βωi j and 
˜gωi y d ˜gωi y dy here g b is the probability of 
winning an auction with only local bidders as described in 
section and f y is the probability density of the bidder 
valuations as before 
 the simulation 
the simulation works by discretising the space of possible 
valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an 
initial set of bidding functions the best response is found by 
maximising equation for each discrete valuation which in 
turn results in a new set of bidding functions these 
functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next 
iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated 
this process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations 
or until a stable solution has been found 
 
clearly due to the large search space finding the 
utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the 
number of auctions and global bidders increases therefore we 
reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two 
dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the 
auctions and low in all the others 
 this simplification is 
justified by the results in section which show that for 
a large number of commonly used distributions the optimal 
global bid consist of at most two different values 
the results reported here are based on the following 
settings 
in order to emphasize that the valuations are 
discrete we use integer values ranging from to each 
valuation occurs with equal probability equivalent to a 
uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case a 
bidder can select between different equally-spaced bid 
levels thus a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ 
 v v v the local bidders are static and 
bid their valuation as before the initial set of functions can 
play an important role in the experiments therefore to 
ensure our results are robust experiments are repeated with 
different random initial functions 
 the results 
first we describe the results with no local bidders for this 
case we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable 
state that is when there is at least one other global bidder 
the best response strategy keeps fluctuating irrespective of 
the number of iterations and of the initial state the 
fluctuations however show a distinct pattern and alternate between 
two states figure depicts these two states for ng and 
m the two states vary most when there are at least as 
many auctions as there are global bidders in that case one 
of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction 
and zero in all others the best response to that however 
is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all 
auctions this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very 
low payment the best response is then again to bid 
truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in 
that particular auction as a result there exists no stable 
solution the same result is observed when the number of 
global bidders is less than the number of auctions this 
oc 
this approach is similar to an alternating-move 
bestresponse process with pure strategies although here we 
consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an 
opponent s best response depends on its valuation 
 
note that the number of possible allocations still increases 
with the number of auctions and global bids however by 
merging all utility-equivalent permutations we significantly 
increase computation speed allowing experiments with 
relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed 
 e g a single iteration with auctions and global bidders 
takes roughly seconds on a ghz pc 
 
we also performed experiments with different precision 
other valuation distributions and dynamic local bidders we 
find that the prinicipal conclusions generalise to these 
different settings and therefore we omit the results to avoid 
repetitiveness

over iterations and experiments with different 
initial settings and m the errorbars show the 
 small standard deviations 
curs since global bidders randomise over auctions and thus 
they cannot coordinate and choose to bid high in different 
auctions 
as shown in figure a similar fluctuation is observed 
when the number of global bidders increases relative to the 
number of auctions however the bids in the equal-bid state 
 state in figure as well as the low bids of the other 
state increase moreover if the number of global bidders is 
increased even further a bifurcation occurs in the equal-bid 
state similar to the case without local bidders 
we now consider the best response strategies when both 
local and global bidders participate and each auction contains 
the same number of local bidders to this end figure 
shows the average variance of the best response strategies 
this is measured as the variance of an actual best-response 
bid over different iterations and then taking the average over 
the discrete bidder valuations here the variance is a gauge 
for the amount of fluctuation and thus the instability of the 
strategy as can be seen from this figure local bidders have 
a large stabilising effect on the global bidder strategies as a 
result the best response strategy approximates a pure 
symmetric nash equilibrium we note that the results converge 
after only a few iterations 
the results show that the principal conclusions in the case 
of a single global bidder carry over to the case of multiple 
global bidders that is the optimal strategy is to bid 
positive in all auctions as long as there are at least as many 
bidders as auctions furthermore a similar bifurcation point 
is observed these results are very robust to changes to the 
auction settings and the parameters of the simulation 
to conclude even though a theoretical analysis proves 
difficult in case of several global bidders we can approximate 
a symmetric nash equilibrium for specific settings using a 
discrete simulation in case the system consists of both local 
and global bidders thus our simulation can be used as a 
tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the 
optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect 
a combination of local and global bidders 
 market efficiency 
efficiency is an important system-wide property since it 
characterises to what extent the market maximises social welfare 
 i e the sum of utilities of all agents in the market to this 
end in this section we study the efficiency of markets with 
either static or dynamic local bidders and the impact that a 
global bidder has on the efficiency in these markets 
specifically efficiency in this context is maximised when the bidders 
with the m highest valuations in the entire market obtain a 
single item each more formally we define the efficiency of 
an allocation as 
definition efficiency of allocation the efficiency ηk 
of an allocation k is the obtained social welfare proportional 
to the maximum social welfare that can be achieved in the 
market and is given by 
ηk 
nt 
i vi k

i vi k 
 
where k 
 arg maxk∈k 
nt 
i vi k is an efficient 
allocation k is the set of all possible allocations vi k is bidder 
i s utility for the allocation k ∈ k and nt is the total 
number of bidders participating across all auctions including any 
global bidders 
now in order to measure the efficiency of the market and 
the impact of a global bidder we run simulations for the 
markets with the different types of local bidders the 
experiments are carried out as follows each bidder s valuation is 
drawn from a uniform distribution with support the 
local bidders bid their true valuations whereas the global 
bidder bids optimally in each auction as described in 
section the experiments are repeated times for each 
run to obtain an accurate mean value and the final 
average results and standard deviations are taken over runs in 
order to get statistically significant results 
the results of these experiments are shown in figure 
note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a 
multiauction market with only local bidders 
for example 
if there are two auctions selling one item each and the two 
bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally in the 
same auction then the bidder with the second-highest value 
does not obtain the good thus the allocation of items to 
bidders is inefficient as can be observed from figure 
however the efficiency increases when n becomes larger this 
is because the differences between the bidders with the 
highest valuations become smaller thereby decreasing the loss of 
efficiency 
furthermore figure shows that the presence of a global 
bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case 
the local bidders are static in the case of dynamic bidders 
however the effect of a global bidder depends on the number 
of sellers if m is low i e for m a global bidder 
significantly increases the efficiency especially for low values of 
 
trivial exceptions are when either m or n and 
bidders are static since the market is then completely efficient 
without a global bidder

figure average efficiency for different market 
settings as shown in the legend the error-bars indicate 
the standard deviation over the runs 
n for m on the other hand the presence of a global 
bidder has a negative effect on the efficiency this effect 
becomes even more pronounced for higher values of m this 
result is explained as follows the introduction of a global 
bidder potentially leads to a decrease of efficiency since this 
bidder can unwittingly win more than one item however 
as the number of local bidders increase this is less likely to 
happen rather since the global bidder increases the 
number of bidders its presence makes an overall positive albeit 
small contribution in case of static bidders in a market with 
dynamic bidders however the market efficiency depends on 
two other factors on the one hand the efficiency increases 
since items no longer remain unsold this situation can 
occur in the dynamic model when no bidder turns up at an 
auction on the other hand as a result of the uncertainty 
concerning the actual number of bidders a global bidder is 
more likely to win multiple items we confirmed this 
analytically as m increases the first effect becomes negligible 
whereas the second one becomes more prominent reducing 
the efficiency on average 
to conclude the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency 
clearly depends on the information that is available in case 
of static local bidders the number of bidders is known and 
the global bidder can bid more accurately in case of 
uncertainty however the global bidder is more likely to win more 
than one item decreasing the overall efficiency 
 conclusions 
in this paper we derive utility-maximising strategies for 
bidding in multiple simultaneous second-price auctions we 
first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in 
all auctions whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a 
single auction for this setting we find the counter-intuitive 
result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions 
that sell the desired item even when a bidder only requires 
a single item and derives no additional benefit from having 
more thus a potential buyer can achieve considerable 
benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an 
optimal bidding strategy for a number of common 
valuation distributions we show analytically that the problem of 
finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions this 
considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can 
thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any 
number of auctions 
furthermore we investigate a setting with multiple global 
bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation 
approach we find that a global bidder s strategy does not 
stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market 
but only converges when there are local bidders as well we 
argue however that real-world markets are likely to contain 
both local and global bidders the converged results are then 
very similar to the setting with a single global bidder and we 
find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple 
auctions for the more complex setting with multiple global 
bidders the simulation can thus be used to find these bids 
for specific cases 
finally we compare the efficiency of a market with 
multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder we 
show that if the bidder can accurately predict the number of 
local bidders in each auction the efficiency slightly increases 
in contrast if there is much uncertainty the efficiency 
significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due 
to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more 
than two items these results show that the way in which 
the efficiency and thus social welfare is affected by a global 
bidder depends on the information that is available to that 
global bidder 
in future work we intend to extend the results to imperfect 
substitutes i e when a global bidder gains from winning 
additional items and to settings where the auctions are no 
longer identical the latter arises for example when the 
number of average local bidders differs per auction or the 
auctions have different settings for parameters such as the 
reserve price
