abstract 
in barter-exchange markets agents seek to swap their items 
with one another in order to improve their own utilities 
these swaps consist of cycles of agents with each agent 
receiving the item of the next agent in the cycle we 
focus mainly on the upcoming national kidney-exchange 
market where patients with kidney disease can obtain 
compatible donors by swapping their own willing but incompatible 
donors with over patients already waiting for a 
cadaver kidney in the us this market is seen as the only 
ethical way to significantly reduce the deaths per year 
attributed to kidney disease 
the clearing problem involves finding a social welfare 
maximizing exchange when the maximum length of a cycle is 
fixed long cycles are forbidden since for incentive reasons 
all transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously 
also in barter-exchanges generally more agents are affected 
if one drops out of a longer cycle we prove that the clearing 
problem with this cycle-length constraint is np-hard 
solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a 
national kidney exchange 
we present the first algorithm capable of clearing these 
markets on a nationwide scale the key is incremental 
problem formulation we adapt two paradigms for the task 
constraint generation and column generation for each we 
develop techniques that dramatically improve both runtime 
and memory usage we conclude that column generation 
scales drastically better than constraint generation our 
algorithm also supports several generalizations as demanded 
by real-world kidney exchanges 
our algorithm replaced cplex as the clearing algorithm

kidney exchanges the match runs are conducted every two

 introduction 
the role of kidneys is to filter waste from blood kidney 
failure results in accumulation of this waste which leads 
to death in months one treatment option is dialysis in 
which the patient goes to a hospital to have his her blood 
filtered by an external machine several visits are required 
per week and each takes several hours the quality of life 
on dialysis can be extremely low and in fact many patients 
opt to withdraw from dialysis leading to a natural death 
only of dialysis patients survive years 
instead the preferred treatment is a kidney transplant 
kidney transplants are by far the most common transplant 
unfortunately the demand for kidneys far outstrips supply 
in the united states in people died waiting for 
a life-saving kidney transplant during this time almost 
 people were added to the national waiting list while 
only people left the list after receiving a 
deceaseddonor kidney the waiting list currently has over 
people and the median waiting time ranges from to 
years depending on blood type 
for many patients with kidney disease the best option is 
to find a living donor that is a healthy person willing to 
donate one of his her two kidneys although there are 
marketplaces for buying and selling living-donor kidneys the 
commercialization of human organs is almost universally 
regarded as unethical and the practice is often explicitly 
illegal such as in the us however in most countries live 
donation is legal provided it occurs as a gift with no 
financial compensation in there were live donations 
in the us 
the number of live donations would have been much higher 
if it were not for the fact that frequently a potential donor 
 
data from the united network for organ sharing 
 
and his intended recipient are blood-type or tissue-type 
incompatible in the past the incompatible donor was sent 
home leaving the patient to wait for a deceased-donor 
kidney however there are now a few regional kidney exchanges 
in the united states in which patients can swap their 
incompatible donors with each other in order to each obtain 
a compatible donor 
these markets are examples of barter exchanges in a 
barter-exchange market agents patients seek to swap their 
items incompatible donors with each other these swaps 
consist of cycles of agents with each agent receiving the 
item of the next agent in the cycle barter exchanges are 
ubiquitous examples include peerflix dvds read it 
swap it books and intervac holiday houses for 
many years there has even been a large shoe exchange in 
the united states people with different-sized feet use 
this to avoid having to buy two pairs of shoes leg amputees 
have a separate exchange to share the cost of buying a single 
pair of shoes 
we can encode a barter exchange market as a directed 
graph g v e in the following way construct one vertex 
for each agent add a weighted edge e from one agent vi to 
another vj if vi wants the item of vj the weight we of e 
represents the utility to vi of obtaining vj s item a cycle c 
in this graph represents a possible swap with each agent in 
the cycle obtaining the item of the next agent the weight 
wc of a cycle c is the sum of its edge weights an exchange 
is a collection of disjoint cycles the weight of an exchange 
is the sum of its cycle weights a social welfare maximizing 
exchange is one with maximum weight 
figure illustrates an example market with agents 
 v v v in which all edges have weight the 
market has cycles c v v c v v c v v 
and c v v v v v and two inclusion maximal 
exchanges namely m c and m c c exchange 
m has both maximum weight and maximum cardinality

figure example barter exchange market 
the clearing problem is to find a maximum-weight 
exchange consisting of cycles with length at most some small 
constant l this cycle-length constraint arises naturally 
for several reasons for example in a kidney exchange all 
operations in a cycle have to be performed simultaneously 
otherwise a donor might back out after his incompatible 
partner has received a kidney one cannot write a binding 
contract to donate an organ this gives rise to a logistical 
constraint on cycle size even if all the donors are operated 
on first and the same personnel and facilities are used to 
then operate on the donees a k-cycle requires between k 
and k doctors around k nurses and almost k operating 
rooms 
due to such resource constraints the upcoming national 
kidney exchange market will likely allow only cycles of length 
 and another motivation for short cycles is that if the 
cycle fails to exchange fewer agents are affected for 
example last-minute testing in a kidney exchange often reveals 
new incompatibilities that were not detected in the initial 
testing based on which the compatibility graph was 
constructed more generally an agent may drop out of a cycle 
if his preferences have changed or he she simply fails to 
fulfill his obligations such as sending a book to another agent 
in the cycle due to forgetfulness 
in section we show that the decision version of the 
clearing problem is np-complete for l ≥ one approach 
then might be to look for a good heuristic or 
approximation algorithm however for two reasons we aim for an 
exact algorithm based on an integer-linear program ilp 
formulation which we solve using specialized tree search 
 first any loss of optimality could lead to unnecessary 
patient deaths 
 second an attractive feature of using an ilp 
formulation is that it allows one to easily model a number of 
variations on the objective and to add additional 
constraints to the problem for example if -cycles are 
believed to be more likely to fail than -cycles then 
one can simply give them a weight that is 
appropriately lower than the weight of a -cycle or if 
for various e g ethical reasons one requires a 
maximum cardinality exchange one can at least in a second 
pass find the solution out of all maximum cardinality 
solutions that has the fewest -cycles other 
variations one can solve for include finding various forms of 
fault tolerant non-disjoint collections of cycles in 
the event that certain pairs that were thought to be 
compatible turn out to be incompatible after all 
in this paper we present the first algorithm capable of 
clearing these markets on a nationwide scale straight-forward 
ilp encodings are too large to even construct on current 
hardware - not to talk about solving them the key then 
is incremental problem formulation we adapt two 
paradigms for the task constraint generation and column 
generation for each we develop a host of mainly 
problemspecific techniques that dramatically improve both runtime 
and memory usage 
 prior work 
several recent papers have used simulations and 
marketclearing algorithms to explore the impact of a national 
kidney exchange for example 
using edmond s maximum-matching algorithm shows 
that a national pairwise-exchange market using length- 
cycles only would result in more transplants reduced waiting 
time and savings of million in heath care costs over 
years those results are conservative in two ways firstly 
the simulated market contained only initial patients 
with patients added every months it has been 
reported to us that the market could be almost double this 
size secondly the exchanges were restricted to length- 
cycles because that is all that can be modeled as maximum 
matching and solved using edmonds s algorithm 
allowing length- cycles leads to additional significant gains this 
has been demonstrated on kidney exchange markets with 
 patients by using cplex to solve an integer-program 
encoding of the clearing problem in this paper we 
 
present an alternative algorithm for this integer program 
that can clear markets with over patients and that 
same number of willing donors 
allowing cycles of length more than often leads to no 
improvement in the size of the exchange furthermore 
in a simplified theoretical model any kidney exchange can 
be converted into one with cycles of length at most 
whilst this does not hold for general barter exchanges or 
even for all kidney exchange markets in section we 
make use of the observation that short cycles suffice to 
dramatically increase the speed of our algorithm 
at a high-level the clearing problem for barter exchanges 
is similar to the clearing problem aka winner 
determination problem in combinatorial auctions in both settings 
the idea is to gather all the pertinent information about the 
agents into a central clearing point and to run a centralized 
clearing algorithm to determine the allocation both 
problems are np-hard both are best solved using tree search 
techniques since significant work has been done in 
computer science and operations research on faster optimal 
tree search algorithms for clearing combinatorial auctions 
 for a recent review see however the kidney 
exchange clearing problem with a limit of or more on 
cycle size is different from the combinatorial auction clearing 
problem in significant ways the most important difference 
is that the natural formulations of the combinatorial 
auction problem tend to easily fit in memory so time is the 
bottleneck in practice in contrast the natural formulations 
of the kidney exchange problem with l take at least 
cubic space in the number of patients to even model and 
therefore memory becomes a bottleneck much before time 
does when using standard tree search such as 
branch-andcut in cplex to tackle the problem on a gb computer 
and a realistic standard instance generator discussed later 
cplex runs out of memory on five of the ten 
 patient instances and ten of the ten -patient instances 
that we generated therefore the approaches that have 
been developed for combinatorial auctions cannot handle 
the kidney exchange problem 
 paper outline 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 
discusses the process by which we generate realistic kidney 
exchange market data in order to benchmark the clearing 
algorithms section contains a proof that the market 
clearing decision problem is np-complete sections and each 
contain an ilp formulation of the clearing problem we also 
detail in those sections our techniques used to solve those 
programs on large instances section presents experiments 
on the various techniques section discusses recent 
fielding of our algorithm finally we present our conclusions in 
section and suggest future research directions 
 market characteristics and 
instance generator 
we test the algorithms on simulated kidney exchange 
markets which are generated by a process described in saidman 
et al this process is based on the extensive nationwide 
data maintained by the united network for organ sharing 
 unos so it generates a realistic instance 
distribution several papers have used variations of this process to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of a national kidney exchange 
 extrapolating from small instances or restricting the 
clearing to -cycles 
briefly the process involves generating patients with a 
random blood type sex and probability of being tissue-type 
incompatible with a randomly chosen donor these 
probabilities are based on actual real-world population data each 
patient is assigned a potential donor with a random blood 
type and relation to the patient if the patient and potential 
donor are incompatible the two are entered into the 
market blood type and tissue type information is then used to 
decide on which patients and donors are compatible one 
complication handled by the generator is that if the 
patient is female and she has had a child with her potential 
donor then the probability that the two are incompatible 
increases this is because the mother develops antibodies 
to her partner during pregnancy finally although our 
algorithms can handle more general weight functions patients 
have a utility of for compatible donors since their survival 
probability is not affected by the choice of donor this 
means that the maximum-weight exchange has maximum 
cardinality 
table gives lower and upper bounds on the size of a 
maximum-cardinality exchange in the kidney-exchange 
market the lower bounds were found by clearing the market 
with length- cycles only while the upper bounds had no 
restriction on cycle length for each market size the bounds 
were computed over randomly generated markets note 
that there can be a large amount of variability in the 
markets - in one patient market less than patients

 problem complexity 
in this section we prove that the decision version of the 
market clearing problem with short cycles is np-complete 
theorem given a graph g v e and an integer 
l ≥ the problem of deciding if g admits a perfect cycle 
cover containing cycles of length at most l is np-complete 
proof it is clear that this problem is in np for 
nphardness we reduce from d-matching which is the 
problem of given disjoint sets x y and z of size q and a set of 
triples t ⊆ x × y × z deciding if there is a disjoint subset 
m of t with size q 
one straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph 
with vertex sets x ∪ y ∪ z and directed edges xa yb 
 yb zc and zc xa for each triple ti xa yb zc ∈ t 
however it is not too hard to see that this encoding fails 
because a perfect cycle cover may include a cycle with no 
corresponding triple 
instead then we use the following reduction given an 
instance of d-matching construct one vertex for each 
element in x y and z for each triple ti xa yb zc 
construct the gadget in figure which is a similar to one 
in garey and johnson pp - note that the gadgets 
intersect only on vertices in x ∪ y ∪ z it is clear that this 
construction can be done in polynomial time

figure np-completeness gadget for triple ti and 
maximum cycle length l 
let m be a perfect d-matching we will show the 
construction admits a perfect cycle cover by short cycles if 
ti xa yb zc ∈ m add from ti s gadget the three 
lengthl cycles containing xa yb and zc respectively also add the 
cycle 
ª 
xi

b zi 
c 
 
 otherwise if ti ∈ m add the three 
lengthl cycles containing xi 
a yi 
b and zi 
c respectively it is clear that 
all vertices are covered since m partitions x × y × z 
conversely suppose we have a perfect cover by short 
cycles note that the construction only has short cycles of 
lengths and l and no short cycle involves distinct 
vertices from two different gadgets it is easy to see then that 
in a perfect cover each gadget ti contributes cycles 
according to the cases above ti ∈ m or ti ∈ m hence there 
exists a perfect d-matching in the original instance 
 solution approaches based on 
an edge formulation 
in this section we consider a formulation of the clearing 
problem as an ilp with one variable for each edge this 
encoding is based on the following classical algorithm for 
solving the directed cycle cover problem with no cycle-length 
constraints 
given a market g v e construct a bipartite graph 
with one vertex for each agent and one vertex for each item 
add an edge ev with weight between each agent v and its 
own item at this point the encoding is a perfect matching 
now for each edge e vi vj in the original market add 
an edge e with weight we between agent vi and the item of 
vj perfect matchings in this encoding correspond exactly 
with cycle covers since whenever an agent s item is taken 
it must receive some other agent s item it follows that the 
unrestricted clearing problem can be solved in polynomial 
time by finding a maximum-weight perfect matching

alternatively we can solve the problem by encoding it 
as an ilp with one variable for each edge in the original 
market graph g this ilp given below has the advantage 
that it can be extended naturally to deal with cycle length 
constraints therefore for the rest of this section this is 
the approach we will pursue 
max 
e∈e 
wee 
such that for all vi ∈ v the conservation constraint 
eout vi vj 
eout − 
ein vj vi 
ein 
and capacity constraint 
eout vi vj 
eout ≤ 
are satisfied 
if cycles are allowed to have length at most l it is easy 
to see that we only need to make the following changes 
to the ilp for each length-l path throughout the 
paper we do not include cycles in the definition of path 
p ep ep epl add a constraint 
ep ep epl ≤ l − 
which precludes path p from being in any feasible solution 
unfortunately in a market with only patients the 
number of length- paths is in excess of million and so 
we cannot even construct this ilp without running out of 
memory 
therefore we use a tree search with an incremental 
formulation approach specifically we use cplex though 
 
we add constraints as cutting planes during the tree search 
process we begin with only a small subset of the constraints 
in the ilp since this ilp is small cplex can solve its lp 
relaxation we then check whether any of the missing 
constraints are violated by the fractional solution if so we 
generate a set of these constraints add them to the ilp 
and repeat even once all constraints are satisfied there 
may be no integral solution matching the fractional upper 
bound and even if there were the lp solver might not find 
it 
in these cases cplex branches on a variable we used 
cplex s default branching strategy and generates one 
new search node corresponding to each of the children at 
each node of the search tree that is visited this process of 
solving the lp and adding constraints is repeated clearly 
this approach yields an optimal solution once the tree search 
finishes 
we still need to explain the details of the constraint seeder 
 i e selecting which constraints to begin with and the 
constraint generation i e selecting which violated constraints 
to include we describe these briefly in the next two 
subsections respectively 
 constraint seeder 
the main constraint seeder we developed forbids any path 
of length l − that does not have an edge closing the cycle 
from its head to its tail while it is computationally 
expensive to find these constraints their addition focuses the 
search away from paths that cannot be in the final solution 
we also tried seeding the lp with a random collection of 
constraints from the ilp 
 constraint generation 
we experimented with several constraint generators in 
each given a fractional solution we construct the subgraph 
of edges with positive value this graph is much smaller 
than the original graph so we can perform the following 
computations efficiently 
in our first constraint generator we simply search for 
length-l paths with value sum more than l − for any 
such path we restrict its sum to be at most l − note 
that if there is a cycle c with length c l it could contain 
as many as c violating paths 
in our second constraint generator we only add one 
constraint for such cycles the sum of edges in the cycle can be 
at most c l − l 
this generator made the algorithm slower so we went 
in the other direction in developing our final generator it 
adds one constraint per violating path p and furthermore 
it adds a constraint for each path with the same interior 
vertices not counting the endpoints as p this improved 
the overall speed 
 experimental performance 
it turned out that even with these improvements the edge 
formulation approach cannot clear a kidney exchange with 
 vertices in the time the cycle formulation described 
later in section can clear one with vertices in 
other words column generation based approaches turned 
out to be drastically better than constraint generation based 
approaches therefore in the rest of the paper we will focus 
on the cycle formulation and the column generation based 
approaches 
 solution approaches based on a 
cycle formulation 
in this section we consider a formulation of the clearing 
problem as an ilp with one variable for each cycle this 
encoding is based on the following classical algorithm for 
solving the directed cycle cover problem when cycles have 
length 
given a market g v e construct a new graph on 
v with a weight wc edge for each cycle c of length it is 
easy to see that matchings in this new graph correspond 
to cycle covers by length- cycles in the original market 
graph hence the market clearing problem with l can 
be solved in polynomial time by finding a maximum-weight 
matching

the market in figure 
we can generalize this encoding for arbitrary l let c l 
be the set of all cycles of g with length at most l then 
the following ilp finds the maximum-weight cycle cover by 
c l cycles

c vi∈c 
c ≤ ∀vi ∈ v 
with c ∈ ∀c ∈ c l 
 edge vs cycle formulation 
in this section we consider the merits of the edge 
formulation and cycle formulation the edge formulation can 
be solved in polynomial time when there are no constraints 
on the cycle size the cycle formulation can be solved in 
polynomial time when the cycle size is at most 
we now consider the case of short cycles of length at most 
l where l ≥ our tree search algorithms use the lp 
relaxation of these formulations to provide upper bounds on 
the optimal solution these bounds help prune subtrees and 
guide the search in the usual ways 
theorem the lp relaxation of the cycle formulation 
weakly dominates the lp relaxation of the edge formulation 
proof consider an optimal solution to the lp 
relaxation of the cycle formulation we show how to construct 
an equivalent solution in the edge formulation for each 
edge in the graph set its value as the sum of values of all 
the cycles of which it is a member also define the value 
of a vertex in the same manner because of the cycle 
constraints the conservation and capacity constraints of the 
edge encoding are clearly satisfied it remains to show that 
none of the path constraints are violated 
let p be any length-l path in the graph since p has l− 
interior vertices not counting the endpoints the value sum 
of these interior vertices is at most l− now for any cycle 
c of length at most l the number of edges it has in p which 
we denote by ec p is at most the number of interior vertices 
it has in p which we denote by vc p hence 
è 
e∈p e 
è 
c∈c l c ec p ≤ 
è 
c∈c l c vc p 
è 
v∈p v l− 
 
the converse of this theorem is not true consider a graph 
which is simply a cycle with n edges clearly the lp 
relaxation of the cycle formulation has optimal value since 
there are no cycles of size at most l however the edge 
formulation has a solution of size n with each edge having 
value 
hence the cycle formulation is tighter than the edge 
formulation additionally for a graph with m edges the edge 
formulation requires o m 
 constraints while the cycle 
formulation requires only o m 
 
 column generation for the lp 
table shows how the number of cycles of length at most 
 grows with the size of the market with one variable per 
cycle in the cycle formulation cplex cannot even clear 
markets with patients without running out of 
memory see figure to address this problem we used an 
incremental formulation approach 
the first step in lp-guided tree search is to solve the 
lp relaxation since the cycle formulation does not fit in 
memory this lp stage would fail immediately without an 
incremental formulation approach however motivated by 
the observation that an exchange solution can include only 
a tiny fraction of the cycles we explored the approach of 
using column i e cycle generation 
the idea of column generation is to start with a restricted 
lp containing only a small number of columns variables 
i e cycles and then to repeatedly add columns until an 
optimal solution to this partially formulated lp is an 
optimal solution to the original aka master lp we explain 
this further by way of an example 
consider the market in figure with l figure 
gives the corresponding master lp p and its dual d 
primal p 
max c c c 
s t c ≤ v 
c c ≤ v 
 c c ≤ v 
 c ≤ v 
with c c c ≥ 
dual d 
min v v v v 
s t v v ≥ c 
 v v ≥ c 
 v v ≥ c 
with v v v v ≥ 
figure cycle formulation 
let p be the restriction of p containing columns c and c 
only let d be the dual of p that is d is just d without 
the constraint c because p and d are small we can solve 
them to obtain opt p opt d with cop t p 
c c and vop t d v v v v 
while cop t p must be a feasible solution of p it turns 
out fortunately that vop t d is feasible for d so that 
opt d ≥ opt d we can verify this by checking that 
vop t d satisfies the constraints of d not already in 
di e constraint c it follows that opt p opt d ≥ 
opt d opt p and so vop t p is provably an 
optimal solution for p even though p is contains a only strict 
subset of the columns of p 
of course it may turn out unfortunately that vop t d 
is not feasible for d this can happen above if vop t d 
v v v v although we can still see 
that opt d opt d in general we cannot prove this 
because d and p are too large to solve instead because 
constraint c is violated we add column c to p update 
d and repeat the problem of finding a violated constraint 
is called the pricing problem here the price of a column 
 cycle in our setting is the difference between its weight and 
the dual-value sum of the cycle s vertices if any column of p 
has a positive price its corresponding constraint is violated 
and we have not yet proven optimality in this case we must 
continue generating columns to add to p 
 pricing problem 
for smaller instances we can maintain an explicit 
collection of all feasible cycles this makes the pricing problem 
easy and efficient to solve we simply traverse the collection 
of cycles and look for cycles with positive price we can 
even find cycles with the most positive price which are the 
ones most likely to improve the objective value of restricted 
lp this approach does not scale however a market 
with patients can have as many as million cycles 
of length at most see table this is too many cycles 
to keep in memory 
hence for larger instances we have to generate feasible 
cycles while looking for one with a positive price we do this 
using a depth-first search algorithm on the market graph 
 see figure in order to make this search faster we 
explore vertices in non-decreasing value order as these vertices 
are more likely to belong to cycles with positive weight we 
also use several pruning rules to determine if the current 
search path can lead to a positive weight cycle for 
example at a given vertex in the search we can prune based on 
the fact that every vertex we visit from this point onwards 
will have value at least as great the current vertex 
even with these pruning rules column generation is a 
bottleneck hence we also implemented the following 
optimizations 
whenever the search exhaustively proves that a vertex 
belongs to no positive price cycle we mark the vertex and 
do not use it as the root of a depth-first search until its 
dual value decreases in this way we avoid unnecessarily 
repeating our computational efforts from a previous column 
generation iteration 
finally it can sometimes be beneficial for column 
generation to include several positive-price columns in one 
iteration since it may be faster to generate a second column 
once the first one is found however we avoid this for the 
following reason if we attempt to find more positive-price 
columns than there are to be found or if the columns are 
far apart in the search space we end up having to generate 
and check a large part of the collection of feasible cycles in 
our experiments we have seen this occur in markets with 
hundreds of millions of cycles resulting in prohibitively 
expensive computation costs 
 column seeding 
even if there is only a small gap to the master lp 
relaxation column generation requires many iterations to 
improve the objective value of the restricted lp each of these 
 
iterations is expensive as we must solve the pricing problem 
and re-solve the restricted lp hence although we could 
begin with no columns in the restricted lp it is much faster 
to seed the lp with enough columns that the optimal 
objective value is not too far from the master lp of course we 
cannot include so many columns that we run out of memory 
we experimented with several column seeders in one 
class of seeder we use a heuristic to find an exchange and 
then add the cycles of that exchange to the initial restricted 
lp we implemented two heuristics the first is a greedy 
algorithm for each vertex in a random order if it is 
uncovered we attempt to include a cycle containing it and 
other uncovered vertices the other heuristic uses 
specialized maximum-weight matching code to find an optimal 
cover by length- cycles 
these heuristics perform extremely well especially 
taking into account the fact that they only add a small 
number of columns for example table shows that an 
optimal cover by length- cycles has almost as much weight 
as the exchange with unrestricted cycle size however we 
have enough memory to include hundreds-of-thousands of 
additional columns and thereby get closer still to the upper 
bound 
our best column seeder constructs a random collection of 
feasible cycles since a market with patients can have 
as many as million feasible cycles it takes too long to 
generate and traverse all feasible cycles and so we do not 
include a uniformly random collection instead we perform 
a random walk on the market graph see for example figure 
 in which after each step of the walk we test whether 
there is an edge back onto our path that forms a feasible 
cycle if we find a cycle it is included in the restricted lp 
and we start a new walk from a random vertex in our 
experiments see section we use this algorithm to seed 
the lp with cycles 
this last approach outperforms the heuristic seeders 
described above however in our algorithm we use a 
combination that takes the union of all columns from all three 
seeders in figure we compare the performance of the 
combination seeder against the combination without the random 
collection seeder we do not plot the performance of the 
algorithm without any seeder at all because it can take hours 
to clear markets we can otherwise clear in a few minutes 
 proving optimality 
recall that our aim is to find an optimal solution to the 
master lp relaxation using column generation we can 
prove that a restricted-primal solution is optimal once all 
columns have non-positive prices unfortunately though 
our clearing problem has the so-called tailing-off effect 
section in which even though the restricted primal is 
optimal in hindsight a large number of additional iterations 
are required in order to prove optimality i e eliminate all 
positive-price columns there is no good general solution 
to the tailing-off effect 
however to mitigate this effect we take advantage of 
the following problem-specific observation recall from 
section that almost always a maximum-weight exchange 
with cycles of length at most has the same weight as an 
unrestricted maximum-weight exchange this does not mean 
that the solver for the unrestricted case will find a 
solution with short cycles however furthermore the 
unrestricted clearing problem can be solved in polynomial time 
 recall section hence we can efficiently compute an 
upper bound on the master lp relaxation and whenever 
the restricted primal achieves this upper bound we have 
proven optimality without necessarily having to eliminate 
all positive-price columns 
in order for this to improve the running time of the overall 
algorithm we need to be able to clear the unrestricted 
market in less time than it takes column generation to eliminate 
all the positive-price cycles even though the first 
problem is polynomial-time solvable this is not trivial for large 
instances for example for a market with patients 
and million edges specialized maximum-weight 
matching code was too slow and cplex ran out of memory 
on the edge formulation encoding from section to make 
this idea work then we used column generation to solve the 
edge formulation 
this involves starting with a small random subset of the 
edges and then adding positive price edges one-by-one until 
none remain we conduct this secondary column 
generation not in the original market graph g but in the perfect 
matching bipartite graph of figure we do this so that we 
only need to solve the lp not the ilp since the integrality 
gap in the perfect matching bipartite graph is -i e there 
always exists an integral solution that achieves the fractional 
upper bound 
the resulting speedup to the overall algorithm is 
dramatic as can be seen in figure 
 column management 
if the optimal value of the initial restricted lp p is far 
from the the master lp p then a large number of columns 
are generated before the gap is closed this leads to 
memory problems on markets with as few as patients also 
even before memory becomes an issue the column 
generation iterations become slow because of the additional 
overhead of solving a larger lp 
to address these issues we implemented a column 
management scheme to limit the size of the restricted lp 
whenever we add columns to the lp we check to see if it contains 
more than a threshold number of columns if this is the 
case we selectively remove columns until it is again below 
the threshold 
 as we discussed earlier only a tiny 
fraction of all the cycles will end up in the final solution it 
is unlikely that we delete such a cycle and even if we do 
it can always be generated again of course we must not 
be too aggressive with the threshold because doing so may 
offset the per-iteration performance gains by significantly 
increasing the number of iterations required to get a suitable 
column set in the lp at the same time 
there are some columns we never delete for example 
those we have branched on see section or those with 
a non-zero lp value amongst the rest we delete those with 
the lowest price since those correspond to the dual 
constraints that are most satisfied this column management 
scheme works well and has enabled us to clear markets with 
 patients as seen in figure 
 branch-and-price search for the ilp 
given a large market clearing problem we can 
successfully solve its lp relaxation to optimality by using the 
column generation enhancements described above however 
the solutions we find are usually fractional thus the next 
 
based on memory size we set the threshold at 
 
step involves performing a branch-and-price tree search 
to find an optimal integral solution 
briefly this is the idea of branch-and-price whenever we 
set a fractional variable to or branch both the master 
lp and the restriction we are working with are changed 
 constrained by default then we need to perform column 
generation go through the effort of pricing at each node of 
the search tree to prove that the constrained restriction is 
optimal for constrained master lp however as discussed 
in section we compute the integral upper bound for 
the root node based on relaxing the cycle length constraint 
completely and whenever any node s lp in the tree achieves 
that value we do not need to continue pricing columns at 
that node 
for the clearing problem with cycles of length at most 
we have found that there is rarely a gap between the optimal 
integral and fractional solutions this means we can largely 
avoid the expensive per node pricing step whenever the 
constrained restricted lp has the same optimal value as its 
parent in the tree search we can prove lp optimality as 
in section without having to include any additional 
columns in the restricted lp 
although cplex can solve ilps it does not support 
branch-and-price for example because there can be 
problemspecific complications involving the interaction between the 
branching rule and the pricing problem hence we 
implemented our own branch-and-price algorithm which explores 
the search tree in depth-first order we also experimented 
with the a node selection order however this search 
strategy requires significantly more memory which we found 
was better employed in making the column generation phase 
faster see section the remaining major components 
of the algorithm are described in the next two subsections 
 primal heuristics 
before branching on a fractional variable we use primal 
heuristics to construct a feasible integral solution these 
solutions are lower bounds on the final optimal integral 
solutions hence whenever a restricted fractional solution is 
no better than the best integral solution found so far we 
prune the current subtree a primal heuristic is effective if 
it is efficient and constructs tight lower bounds 
we experimented with two primal heuristics the first 
is a simple rounding algorithm include all cycles with 
fractional value at least and then ensuring feasibility 
greedily add the remaining cycles whilst this heuristic is 
efficient we found that the lower bounds it constructs rarely 
enable much pruning 
we also tried using cplex as a primal heuristic at 
any given node of the search tree we can convert the 
restricted lp relaxation back to an ilp by reintroducing the 
integrality constraints cplex has several built-in primal 
heuristics which we can apply to this ilp moreover we can 
use cplex s own tree search to find an optimal integral 
solution in general this tree search is much faster than our 
own 
if cplex finds an integral solution that matches the 
fractional upper bound at the root node we are done 
otherwise no such integral solution exists or we don t yet have 
the right combination of cycles in the restricted lp for 
kidney-exchange markets it is usually the second reason 
that applies see sections and hence at some 
point in the tree search once more columns have been 
generated as a result of branching the cplex heuristic will 
find an optimal integral solution 
although cplex tree search is faster than our own it is 
not so fast that we can apply it to every node in our search 
tree hence we make the following optimizations firstly 
we add a constraint that requires the objective value of the 
ilp to be as large as the fractional target if this is not 
the case we want to abort and proceed to generate more 
columns with our branch-and-price search secondly we 
limit the number of nodes in cplex s search tree this is 
because we have observed that no integral solution exists 
cplex can take a very long time to prove that finally 
we only apply the cplex heuristic at a node if it has a 
sufficiently different set of cycles from its parent 
using cplex as a primal heuristic has a large impact 
because it makes the search tree smaller so all the 
computationally expensive pricing work is avoided at nodes that 
are not generated in this smaller tree 
 cycle brancher 
we experimented with two branching strategies both of 
which select one variable per node the first strategy 
branching by certainty randomly selects a variable from those 
whose lp value is closest to the second strategy 
branching by uncertainty randomly selects a variable whose lp 
value is closest to in either case two children of the 
node are generated corresponding to two subtrees one in 
which the variable is set to the other in which it is set 
to our depth-first search always chooses to explore first 
the subtree in which the value of the variable is closest to 
its fractional value 
for our clearing problem with cycles of length at most 
 we found branching by uncertainty to be superior rarely 
requiring any backtracking 
 experimental results 
all our experiments were performed in linux red hat 
 using a dell pc with a ghz intel pentium 
processor and gb of ram wherever we used cplex e g in 
solving the lp and as a primal heuristic as discussed in the 
previous sections we used cplex 
figure shows the runtime performance of four clearing 
algorithms for each market size listed we randomly 
generated markets and attempted to clear them using each 
of the algorithms 
the first algorithm is cplex on the full cycle 
formulation this algorithm fails to clear any markets with 
patients or more also its running time on markets smaller 
than this is significantly worse than the other algorithms 
the other algorithms are variations of the incremental 
column generation approach described in section we begin 
with the following settings all optimizations are switched 
on 
category setting 
column seeder combination of greedy exchange 
and maximum-weight matching 
heuristics and random walk 
seeder cycles 
column generation one column at a time 
column management on with column limit 
optimality prover on 
primal heuristic rounding cplex tree search 
branching rule uncertainty 
 
the combination of these optimizations allows us to easily 
clear markets with over patients in each of the next 
two algorithms we turn one of these optimizations off to 
highlight its effectiveness 
first we restrict the seeder so that it only begins with 
 cycles this setting is faster for smaller instances 
since the lp relaxations are smaller and faster to solve 
however at vertices this effect starts to be offset by 
the additional column generation that must be performed 
for larger instance this restricted seeder is clearly worse 
finally we restore the seeder to its optimized setting but 
this time remove the optimality prover described in 
section as in many column generation problems the 
tailing-off effect is substantial by taking advantage of the 
properties of our problem we manage to clear a market with 
 patients in about the same time it would otherwise 
have taken to clear a patient market 
 fielding the technology 
our algorithm and implementation replaced cplex as 
the clearing algorithm of the alliance for paired donation 
one of the leading kidney exchanges in december we 
conduct a match run every two weeks and the first 
transplants based on our solutions have already been conducted 
while there are for political inter-personal reasons at 
least four kidney exchanges in the us currently everyone 
understands that a unified unfragmented national exchange 
would save more lives we are in discussions with additional 
kidney exchanges that are interested in adopting our 
technology this way our technology and the processes around 
it will hopefully serve as a substrate that will eventually 
help in unifying the exchanges at least computational 
scalability is no longer an obstacle 
 conclusionandfutureresearch 
in this work we have developed the most scalable exact 
algorithms for barter exchanges to date with special focus 
on the upcoming national kidney-exchange market in which 
patients with kidney disease will be matched with 
compatible donors by swapping their own willing but incompatible 
donors with over patients already waiting for a 
cadaver kidney in the us this market is seen as the only 
ethical way to significantly reduce the deaths per year 
attributed to kidney disease 
our work presents the first algorithm capable of clearing 
these markets on a nationwide scale it optimally solves 
the kidney exchange clearing problem with 
donordonee pairs thus there is no need to resort to approximate 
solutions the best prior technology vanilla cplex 
cannot handle instances beyond about donor-donee pairs 
because it runs out of memory the key to our 
improvement is incremental problem formulation we adapted two 
paradigms for the task constraint generation and column 
generation for each we developed a host of techniques 
that substantially improve both runtime and memory 
usage some of the techniques use domain-specific 
observations while others are domain independent we conclude 
that column generation scales dramatically better than 
constraint generation for column generation in the lp our 
enhancements include pricing techniques column seeding 
techniques techniques for proving optimality without 
having to bring in all positive-price columns and using another 
column-generation process in a different formulation to do 
so and column removal techniques for the 
branch-andprice search in the integer program that surrounds the lp 
our enhancements include primal heuristics and we also 
compared branching strategies undoubtedly further 
parameter tuning and perhaps additional speed improvement 
techniques could be used to make the algorithm even faster 
our algorithm also supports several generalizations as 
desired by real-world kidney exchanges these include 
multiple alternative donors per patient weighted edges in the 
market graph to encode differences in expected life years 
added based on degrees of compatibility patient age and 
weight etc as well as the probability of last-minute 
incompatibility angel-triggered chains chains of transplants 
triggered by altruistic donors who do not have patients 
associated with them each chain ending with a left-over kidney 
and additional issues such as different scores for saving 
different altruistic donors or left-over kidneys for future match 
runs based on blood type tissue type and likelihood that 
the organ would not disappear from the market by the donor 
getting second thoughts because we use an ilp 
methodology we can also support a variety of side constraints which 
often play an important role in markets in practice we 
can also support forcing part of the allocation for example 
this acutely sick teenager has to get a kidney if possible 
our work has treated the kidney exchange as a batch 
problem with full information at least in the short run 
kidney exchanges will most likely continue to run in batch mode 
every so often two important directions for future work 
are to explicitly address both online and limited-information 
aspects of the problem 
the online aspect is that donees and donors will be 
arriving into the system over time and it may be best to not 
execute the myopically optimal exchange now but rather 
save part of the current market for later matches in fact 
some work has been done on this in certain restricted 
settings 
the limited-information aspect is that even in batch mode 
the graph provided as input is not completely correct a 
number of donor-donee pairs believed to be compatible turn 
out to be incompatible when more expensive last-minute 
tests are performed therefore it would be desirable to 
perform an optimization with this in mind such as outputting 
a low-degree robust subgraph to be tested before the final 
match is produced or to output a contingency plan in case 
of failure we are currently exploring a number of 
questions along these lines but there is certainly much more to 
be done
