this paper presents a simple and scalable framework for 
architecting peer-to-peer overlays called peer-to-peer 
receiverdriven overlay or pro pro is designed for non-interactive 
streaming applications and its primary design goal is to 
maximize delivered bandwidth and thus delivered quality to 
peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth to 
achieve this goal pro adopts a receiver-driven approach 
where each receiver or participating peer i independently 
discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping and 
 ii selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through 
which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own 
delivered bandwidth participating peers form an 
unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate 
furthermore each receiver leverages congestion controlled 
bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and 
react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition 
without any explicit coordination with other participating 
peers independent parent selection by individual peers

 introduction 
limited deployment of ip multicast has motivated a new 
distribution paradigm over the internet based on overlay 
networks where a group of participating end-systems or 
peers form an overlay structure and actively participate in 
distribution of content without any special support from the 
network e g since overlay structures are layered over 
the best-effort internet any approach for constructing 
overlay should address the following fundamental challenges i 
scalability with the number of participating peers ii 
robustness to dynamics of peer participation iii adaptation 
to variations of network bandwidth and iv 
accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity 
among participating peers coping with bandwidth 
variations heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly 
important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming 
applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly 
determined by its bandwidth connectivity to other peer s 
on the overlay 
this paper presents a simple framework for architecting 
peer-to-peer receiver-driven overlay called pro pro can 
accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming 
applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live 
sessions the main design philosophy in pro is that each 
peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly 
determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to 
maximize its own delivered quality toward this end each 
peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points 
 i e receive content through multiple parent peers 
therefore participating peers form an unstructured overlay that 
can gracefully cope with high churn rate furthermore 
having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth 
heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against 
dynamics of peer participation 
pro consists of two key components i gossip-based 
peer discovery each peer periodically exchanges message 
 i e gossips with other known peers to progressively learn 
about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that 
are likely to be good parents gossiping provides a 
scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured 
peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide 
direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties 
 e g peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth ii 
receiver-driven parent selection given the collected 
information about other participating peers by gossiping 
mechanism each peer or receiver gradually improves its own 
delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset 
of parent peers that collectively maximize provided 
bandwidth to the receiver since the available bandwidth from 
different participating peers to a receiver and possible 
correlation among them can be measured only at that receiver a 
receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize 
available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers furthermore 
the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an 
implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes 
in network or overlay condition without any explicit 
coordination with other participating peers independent parent 
selection by individual peers leads to an efficient overlay that 
maximizes delivered quality to each peer pro incorporates 
 
several damping functions to ensure stability of the overlay 
despite uncoordinated actions by different peers 
pro is part of a larger architecture that we have 
developed for peer-to-peer streaming in our earlier work we 
developed a mechanism called pals that enables a 
receiver to stream layered structured content from a given 
set of congestion controlled senders thus pro and pals 
are both receiver-driven but complement each other more 
specifically pro determines a proper subset of parent peers 
that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each 
receiver whereas pals coordinates in-time streaming of 
different segments of multimedia content from these parents 
despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth 
this division of functionality provides a great deal of 
flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery 
mechanism in this paper we primarily focus on the overlay 
construction mechanism or pro 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 
 we revisit the problem of overlay construction for 
peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and 
explore their design space we illustrate the differences 
between pro and previous solutions and justify our design 
choices we present our proposed framework in section 
in sections and the key components of our framework 
are described in further detail finally section concludes 
the paper and presents our future plans 
 revisiting the problem 
constructing a peer-to-peer overlay for streaming 
applications should not only accommodate global design goals such 
as scalability and resilience but also satisfy the local design 
goal of maximizing delivered quality to individual peers 
 
more specifically delivered quality of streaming content to 
each peer should be proportional to its incoming access link 
bandwidth achieving these goals is particularly challenging 
because participating peers often exhibit heterogeneity and 
asymmetry in their bandwidth connectivity 
solutions for constructing peer-to-peer overlays often 
require two key mechanisms to be implemented at each peer 
peer discovery pd and parent selection ps the pd 
mechanism enables each peer to learn about other 
participating peers in the overlay information about other peers 
are used by the ps mechanism at each peer to determine 
proper parent peers through which it should connect to the 
overlay the collective behavior of pd and ps mechanisms 
at all participating peers leads to an overlay structure that 
achieves the above design goals there has been a wealth of 
previous research that explored design space of the pd and 
ps mechanisms as follows 
peer discovery in structured peer-to-peer networks the 
existing structure enables each peer to find other 
participating peers in a scalable fashion e g however 
structured peer-to-peer networks may not be robust against 
high churn rate in contrast unstructured peer-to-peer 
networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate 
but require a separate peer discovery mechanism 
meshfirst approaches e g that require each peer to know 
about all other participating peers as well as centralized 
approaches e g to peer discovery exhibit limited 
scalability nice leverages a hierarchal structure to achieve 
 
it is worth clarifying that our design goal is different from 
common goals in building application-level multicast trees 
 i e minimizing stretch and stress 
scalability but each peer only knows about a group of 
closeby peers who may not be good parents i e may not provide 
sufficient bandwidth 
parent selection we examine two key aspects of parent 
selections 
 i selection criteria there are two main criteria for 
parent selections relative delay and available bandwidth 
between two peers relative delay between any two peers can 
be estimated in a scalable fashion with one of the existing 
landmark-based solutions such as global network 
positioning gnp however estimating available bandwidth 
between two peers requires end-to-end measurement 
using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does 
not scale for two reasons first to cope with dynamics of 
bandwidth variations each peer requires to periodically 
estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through 
measurement e g second the probability of 
interference among different measurements grows with the number 
of peers in an overlay similar to joint experiment in rlm 
 
most of the previous solutions adopted the idea of 
application level multicast and used delay as the main selection 
criteria participating peers cooperatively run a distributed 
algorithm to organize themselves into a source-rooted tree 
structure in order to minimize either overall delay across 
all branches of the tree e g or delay between source 
and each receiver peer e g while these parent 
selection strategies minimize associated network load they may 
not provide sufficient bandwidth to individual peers because 
delay is often not a good indicator for available bandwidth 
between two peers the key issue is that minimizing 
overall delay global design goal and maximizing delivered 
bandwidth to each peer local design goal could easily be in 
conflict more specifically parent peers with longer relative 
distance may provide higher bandwidth than close-by 
parents this suggests that there might exist a tradeoff between 
maximizing provided bandwidth to each peer and 
minimizing overall delay across the overlay 
 ii single vs multiple parents a single tree structure for 
the overlay where each peer has a single parent is 
inherently unable to accommodate peers with heterogeneous 
and asymmetric bandwidth a common approach to 
accommodating bandwidth heterogeneity is to use layer 
structured content either layered or multiple description 
encodings and allow each receiver to have multiple parents this 
approach could accommodate heterogeneity but it 
introduces several new challenges first parent selection 
strategy should be determined based on location of a bottleneck 
if the bottleneck is at the outgoing access links of parent 
peers 
 then a receiver should simply look for more parents 
however when the bottleneck is else where in the network 
a receiver should select parents with a diverse set of paths 
 i e utilize different network paths in practice a 
combination of these cases might simultaneously exist among 
participating peers second streaming a single 
content from multiple senders is challenging for two reasons 
 this requires tight coordination among senders to 
determine overall delivered quality e g number of layers and 
decide which sender is responsible for delivery of each 
segment delivered segments from different senders should 
arrive before their playout times despite uncorrelated 
vari 
if bottleneck is at the receiver s access link then provided 
bandwidth to the receiver is already maximized 
 
ations in congestion controlled bandwidth from different 
senders this also implies that those solutions that build 
multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure 
in-time delivery of individual segments e g may 
not be able to support streaming applications 
one approach to build a multi-parent overlay is to 
organize participating peers into different trees where each layer 
of the stream is sent to a separate tree e g each 
peer can maximize its quality by participating in a proper 
number of trees this approach raises several issues the 
provided bandwidth to peers in each tree is limited by 
minimum uplink bandwidth among upstream peers on that tree 
in the presence of bandwidth asymmetry this could easily 
limit delivered bandwidth on each tree below the required 
bandwidth for a single layer it is not feasible to build 
separate trees that are all optimal for a single selection criteria 
 e g overall delay connections across different trees are 
likely to compete for available bandwidth on a single 
bottleneck 
 we conclude that a practical solution for 
peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following 
design properties i it should use an unstructured 
multiparent peer-to-peer overlay ii it should provide a scalable 
peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its 
good parents efficiently iii it should detect and possibly 
avoid any shared bottleneck among different connections in 
the overlay and iv it should deploy congestion controlled 
connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments 
to each receiver in the next section we explain how pro 
incorporates all the above design properties 
 p p receiver-driven overlay 
assumptions we assume that each peer can estimate 
the relative distance between any two peers using the gnp 
mechanism furthermore each peer knows the 
incoming and outgoing bandwidth of its access link each peer 
uses the pals mechanism to stream content from 
multiple parent peers all connections are congestion controlled 
by senders e g to accommodate peer bandwidth 
heterogeneity we assume that the content has a layered 
representation in other words with proper adjustment 
the framework should work with both layered and 
multipledescription encodings participating peers have 
heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity 
furthermore peers may join and leave in an arbitrary fashion 
overview in pro each peer or receiver progressively 
searches for a subset of parents that collectively maximize 
delivered bandwidth and minimize overall delay from all 
parents to the receiver such a subset of parents may change 
over time as some parents join or leave the overlay or 
available bandwidth from current parents significantly changes 
note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at 
the same time 
 each receiver periodically exchanges 
messages i e gossips with other peers in the overlay to learn 
about those participating peers that are potentially good 
parents potentially good parents for a receiver are 
identified based on their relative utility for the receiver the 
utility of a parent peer pi for a receiver pj is a function of 
their relative network distance delij and the outgoing 
access link bandwidth of the parent outbwi i e u pi pj 
 
these multi-tree approaches often do not use congestion 
control for each connection 
 
throughout this paper we use receiver and parent as 
short form for receiver peer and parent peer 
 f delij outbwi using parents access link bandwidth 
instead of available bandwidth has several advantages i 
outgoing bandwidth is an upper bound for available 
bandwidth from a parent therefore it enables the receiver to 
roughly classify different parents ii estimating available 
bandwidth requires end-to-end measurement and such a 
solution does not scale with the number of peers and more 
importantly iii given a utility function this approach 
enables any peer in the overlay to estimate relative utility of 
any other two peers each receiver only maintains 
information about a fixed and relatively small number of promising 
parent peers in its local image the local image at each 
receiver is dynamically updated with new gossip messages as 
other peers join leave the overlay each peer selects a new 
parent in a demand-driven fashion in order to minimize the 
number of end-to-end bandwidth measurements and thus 
improve scalability when a receiver needs a new parent 
its ps mechanism randomly selects a peer from its local 
image where probability of selecting a peer directly depends on 
its utility then the actual properties i e available 
bandwidth and delay of the selected parent are verified through 
passive measurement toward this end the selected parent 
is added to the parent list which triggers pals to request 
content from this parent figure depicts the interactions 
between pd and ps mechanisms 
in pro each receiver leverages congestion controlled 
bandwidth from its parents as an implicit signal to detect two 
events i any measurable shared bottleneck among 
connections from different parents and ii any change in 
network or overlay conditions e g departure or arrival of other 
close-by peers figure shows part of an overlay to 
illustrate this feature each receiver continuously monitors 
available bandwidth from all its parents receiver p initially has 
only p as a parent when p adds a new parent p the 
receiver examines the smoothed available bandwidth from 
p and p and any measurable correlation between them if 
the available bandwidth from p decreases after p is added 
the receiver can conclude that these two parents are behind 
the same bottleneck i e link l we note that paths 
from two parents might have some overlap that does not 
include any bottleneck assume another receiver p selects 
p as a parent and thus competes with receiver p for 
available bandwidth on link l suppose that l becomes a 
bottleneck and the connection between p to p obtains a 
significantly higher share of l s bandwidth than connection 
between p to p this change in available bandwidth from 
p serves as a signal for p whenever a receiver detects such 
a drop in bandwidth it waits for a random period of time 
 proportional to the available bandwidth and then drops

therefore the receiver with a higher bandwidth 
connectivity p is more likely to keep p as parent whereas p may 
examine other parents with higher bandwidth including p 
the congestion controlled bandwidth signals the receiver to 
properly reshape the overlay we present a summary of key 
features and limitations of pro in the next two sections 
table summarizes our notation throughout this paper 
main features gossiping provides a scalable approach 
to peer discovery because each peer does not require global 
knowledge about all group members and its generated 
traffic can be controlled the pd mechanism actively 
participates in peer selection by identifying peers for the 
local image which limits the possible choices of parents for 
the ps mechanism pro constructs a multi-parent 
unstructured overlay but pro does not have the same 
limitations that exist in multi-tree approaches because it 
allows each receiver to independently micro-manage its 
parents to maximize its overall bandwidth based on local 
information pro conducts passive measurement not only to 
determine available bandwidth from a parent but also to detect 
any shared bottleneck between paths from different parents 
furthermore by selecting a new parent from the local 
image pro increases the probability of finding a good parent 
in each selection and thus significantly decreases number of 
required measurements which in turn improves scalability 
pro can gracefully accommodate bandwidth heterogeneity 
and asymmetry among peers since pals is able to manage 
delivery of content from a group of parents with different 
bandwidth 
limitations and challenges the main hypothesis in our 
framework is that the best subset of parents for each receiver 
are likely to be part of its local image i e pd mechanism 
can find the best parents whenever this condition is not 
satisfied either a receiver may not be able to maximize its 
overall bandwidth or resulting overlay may not be efficient

clearly properties of the selected utility function as well as 
accuracy of estimated parameters in particular using 
outgoing bandwidth instead of available bandwidth determine 
properties of the local image at each peer which in turn 
affects performance of the framework in some scenarios in 
these cases the utility value may not effectively guide the 
search process in identifying good parents which increases 
the average convergence time until each peer finds a good 
subset of parents similar to many other adaptive 
mechanisms e g the parent selection mechanism should 
address the fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness and 
stability finally the congestion controlled bandwidth from 
parent peers may not provide a measurable signal to 
detect a shared bottleneck when level of multiplexing is high 
at the bottleneck link however this is not a major 
limitation since the negative impact of a shared bottleneck in 
these cases is minimal all the above limitations are in part 
due to the simplicity of our framework and would adversely 
affect its performance however we believe that this is a 
reasonable design tradeoff since simplicity is one of our key 
design goals in the following sections we describe the two 
key components of our framework in further details 
 gossip-based peer discovery 
peer discovery at each receiver is basically a search among 
all participating peers in the overlay for a certain number 
 img sz of peers with the highest relative utility pro 
adopts a gossip-like approach to peer discovery 
gossiping or rumor spreading has been frequently used as a 
scalable alternative to flooding that gradually spreads 
information among a group of peers however we use gossiping as 
a search mechanism for finding promising parents since 
it has two appealing properties i the volume of exchanged 
messages can be controlled and ii the gossip-based 
information exchange can be customized to leverage relative 
utility values to improve search efficiency 
the gossip mechanism works as follow each peer 
maintains a local image that contains up to img sz records where 
each record represents the following information for a 
previously discovered peer pi in the overlay ip address 
gnp coordinates number of received layers timestamp 
when the record was last generated by a peer outbwi and 
 inbwi to bootstrap the discovery process a new 
receiver needs to learn about a handful of other participating 
peers in the overlay this information can be obtained from 
the original server or a well-known rendezvous point the 
server should implement a strategy for selecting the initial 
peers that are provided to each new receiver we call this 
the initial parent selection mechanism once the initial set 
of peers are known each peer pi periodically invokes a target 
selection mechanism to determine a target peer pj from its 
local image for gossip given a utility function peer pi uses 
a content selection strategy to select sgm records or smaller 
number when sgm records are not available from its local 
image that are most useful for pj and send those records to 
pj in response pj follows the same steps and replies with 
a gossip message that includes sgm records from its local 
image that are most useful for pi i e bidirectional 
gossip when a gossip message arrives at each peer an image 
maintenance scheme integrates new records into the current 
local image and discards excess records such that certain 
property of the local image is improved e g increase 
overall utility of peers in the image aggregate performance of 
 
a gossip mechanism can be presented by two average 
metrics and their distribution among peers i average 
convergence time average number of gossip messages until all 
peers in an overlay reach their final images and ii average 
efficiency ratio average ratio of unique records to the total 
number of received records by each peer 
we have been exploring the design space of four key 
components of the gossip mechanism frequency and size of 
gossip messages determine average freshness of local images 
currently the server randomly selects the initial parents 
from its local image for each new peer 
target selection target selection randomly picks a peer 
from the current image to evenly obtain information from 
different areas of the overlay and speed up discovery 
content selection peer pk determines relative utility of all 
the peers pj in its local image for target peer pi and then 
randomly selects sgm peers to prepare a gossip message for 
pi however probability of selecting a peer directly depends 
on its utility this approach is biased towards peers with 
higher utility but its randomness tend to reduce number of 
duplicate records in different gossip message from one peer 
 i e improves efficiency a potential drawback of this 
approach is the increase in convergence time we plan to 
examine more efficient information sharing schemes such as 
bloom filters in our future work pro uses joint-ranking 
 to determine relative utility of a parent for a receiver 
given a collection of peers in a local image of pk the 
jointranking scheme ranks all the peers once based on their 
outgoing bandwidth and then based on their estimated delay 
from a target peer pi the utility of peer pj u pj pi 
is inversely proportional to the sum of pj s ranks in both 
rankings values for each property i e bandwidth and 
delay of various peers are divided into multiple ranges i e 
bins where all peers within each range are assumed to have 
the same value for that property this binning scheme 
minimizes the sensitivity to minor differences in delay or 
bandwidth among different peers 
image maintenance image maintenance mechanism evicts 
extra records beyond img sz that satisfy one of the 
following conditions i represent peers with the lower utility ii 
represent peers that were already dropped by the ps 
mechanism due to poor performance and iii have a timestamp 
older than a threshold this approach attempts to balance 
image quality in terms of overall utility of existing peers 
and its freshness 
note that the gossip mechanism can discover any peer 
in the overlay as long as reachability is provided through 
overlap among local images at different peers the higher 
the amount of overlap the higher the efficiency of discovery 
and the higher the robustness of the overlay to dynamics of 
peer participations the amount of overlap among images 
depends on both the size and shape of the local images at 
each peer the shape of the local image is a function of 
the deployed utility function joint-ranking utility gives the 
same weight to delay and bandwidth delay tends to bias 
selection towards near-by peers whereas outgoing bandwidth 
introduces some degree of randomness in location of selected 
peers therefore the resulting local images should exhibit 
a sufficient degree of overlap 
 parent selection 
the ps mechanism at each peer is essentially a 
progressive search within the local image for a subset of parent 
peers such that the following design goals are achieved i 
maximizing delivered bandwidth 
 ii minimizing the total 
delay from all parents to the receiver and iii 
maximizing diversity of paths from parents whenever it is feasible 
whenever these goals are in conflict a receiver optimizes 
the goal with the highest priority currently our framework 
does not directly consider diversity of paths from different 
parents as a criteria for parent selection however the 
indirect effect of shared path among parents is addressed 
because of its potential impact on available bandwidth from 
a parent when two or more parents are behind the same 
bottleneck 
the number of active parents nopi t for each receiver 
should be within a configured range min nop max nop 
each receiver tries to maximize its delivered bandwidth with 
the minimum number of parents if this goal can not be 
achieved after evaluation of a certain number of new 
parents the receiver will gradually increase its number of 
parents this flexibility is important in order to utilize 
available bandwidth from low bandwidth parents i e cope with 
bandwidth heterogeneity min nop determines minimum 
degree of resilience to parent departure and minimum level 
of path diversity whenever diverse paths are available the 
number of children for each peer should not be limited 
instead each peer only limits maximum outgoing bandwidth 
that it is able or willing to provide to its children this 
allows child peers to compete for congestion controlled 
bandwidth from a parent which motivates child peers with poor 
bandwidth connectivity to look for other parents i e 
properly reshape the overlay 
design of a ps mechanism should address three main 
questions as follows 
 when should a new parent be selected 
there is a fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness of 
a receiver to changes in network conditions or convergence 
time after a change and stability of the overlay pro adopts 
a conservative approach where each peer selects a new 
parent in a demand-driven fashion this should significantly 
reduce number of new parent selections which in turn 
improves scalability by minimizing the interference caused by 
new connections and stability of the overlay structure a 
new parent is selected in the following scenarios i initial 
phase when a new peer joins the overlay it periodically 
adds a new parent until it has min nop parents ii 
replacing a poorly-performing parent when available 
bandwidth from an existing parent is significantly reduced for a 
long time or a parent leaves the session the receiver can 
select another peer after a random delay each receiver 
selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth 
from the parent peer this approach dampens potential 
oscillation in the overlay while increasing the chance for 
receivers with higher bandwidth connectivity to keep a parent 
 i e properly reshapes the overlay iii improvement in 
performance when it is likely that a new parent would 
significantly improve a non-optimized aspect of performance 
 increase the bandwidth or decrease the delay this 
strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new 
peers are discovered or joined the overlay the available 
information for each peer in the image is used as a heuristic 
to predict performance of a new peer such an improvement 
should be examined infrequently a hysteresis mechanism 
 
the target bandwidth is the lower value between maximum 
stream bandwidth and receiver s incoming bandwidth 
 
is implemented in scenario ii and iii to dampen any 
potential oscillation in the overlay 
 which peer should be selected as a new parent 
at any point of time peers in the local image are the best 
known candidate peers to serve as parent in pro each 
receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image 
where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional 
to its utility deploying this selection strategy by all peers 
lead to proportional utilization of outgoing bandwidth of all 
peers without making the selection heavily biased towards 
high bandwidth peers this approach similar to 
leverages heterogeneity among peers since number of children for 
each peer is proportional to its outgoing bandwidth 
 how should a new parent be examined 
each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth 
from all parents and potential correlation between 
bandwidth of two or more connections as signal for shared 
bottleneck the degree of such correlation also reveals the level 
of multiplexing at the bottleneck link and could serve as 
an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local 
one such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of 
each flow over a relatively long time scale e g hundreds 
of rtt to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth 
to avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near 
future the receiver associates a timer to each parent and 
exponentially backs off the timer after each failed 
experience 
after the initial phase each receiver maintains a fixed 
number of parents at any point of time nopi t thus a 
new parent should replace one of the active parents 
however to ensure monotonic improvement in overall 
performance of active parents a new parent is always added 
before one of the existing parents is dropped i e a receiver 
can temporarily have one extra parent given the 
available bandwidth from all parents including the new one 
and possible correlation among them a receiver can use one 
of the following criteria to drop a parent i to maximize 
the bandwidth the receiver can drop the parent that 
contributes minimum bandwidth ii to maximize path 
diversity among connections from parents the receiver should 
drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck 
with the largest number of active parents and contributes 
minimum bandwidth among them finally if the 
aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required 
bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents 
 and nopi t max nop the receiver can increase the total 
number of parents by one 
 conclusions and future work 
in this paper we presented a simple receiver-driven 
framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called 
pro pro allows each peer to selfishly and independently 
determine the best way to connect to the overlay to 
maximize its performance therefore pro should be able to 
maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and 
asymmetric bandwidth connectivity both peer discovery 
and peer selection in this framework are scalable 
furthermore pro uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an 
implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing 
parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions 
to properly reshape the structure we described the basic 
framework and its key components and sketched our 
strawman solutions 
this is a starting point for our work on pro we are 
currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via 
simulation and exploring the design space of key 
components we are also prototyping this framework to conduct 
real-world experiments on the planet-lab in a near future
