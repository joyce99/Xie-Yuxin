information markets which are designed specifically to 
aggregate traders information are becoming increasingly 
popular as a means for predicting future events recent 
research in information markets has resulted in two new 
designs market scoring rules and dynamic parimutuel 
markets we develop an analytic method to guide the design 
and strategic analysis of information markets our central 
contribution is a new abstract betting game the projection 
game that serves as a useful model for information 
markets we demonstrate that this game can serve as a strategic 
model of dynamic parimutuel markets and also captures the 
essence of the strategies in market scoring rules the 
projection game is tractable to analyze and has an attractive 
geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and 
interactions more transparent we use it to prove several 
strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market 
we also prove that a special form of the projection game is 
strategically equivalent to the spherical scoring rule and it 
is strategically similar to other scoring rules finally we 
illustrate two applications of the model to analysis of complex 
strategic scenarios we analyze the precision of a market in 
which traders have inertia and a market in which a trader 
can profit by manipulating another trader s beliefs

 introduction 
markets have long been used as a medium for trade as 
a side effect of trade the participants in a market reveal 
something about their preferences and beliefs for example 
in a financial market agents would buy shares which they 
think are undervalued and sell shares which they think are 
overvalued it has long been observed that because the 
market price is influenced by all the trades taking place it 
aggregates the private information of all the traders thus 
in a situation in which future events are uncertain and each 
trader might have a little information the aggregated 
information contained in the market prices can be used to 
predict future events this has motivated the creation of 
information markets which are mechanisms for aggregating 
the traders information about an uncertain event 
information markets can be modeled as a game in which 
the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes such 
as the results of a presidential election by buying shares 
of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is 
realized as in financial markets the participants aim to 
maximize their profit by buying low and selling high in 
this way the players behavior transmits their personal 
information and beliefs about the possible outcomes and can 
be used to predict the event more accurately the benefit of 
well-designed information markets goes beyond information 
aggregation they can also be used as a hedging instrument 
to allow traders to insure against risk 
recently researchers have turned to the problem of 
designing market structures specifically to achieve better 
information aggregation properties than traditional markets 
two designs for information markets have been proposed 
the dynamic parimutuel market dpm by pennock 
and the market scoring rules msr by hanson both 
the dpm and the msr were designed with the goal of giving 
informed traders an incentive to trade and to reveal their 
information as soon as possible while also controlling the 
subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the 
market 
the dpm was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel 
market which is commonly used for betting on horses and a 
continuous double auction in order to simultaneously obtain 
the first one s infinite buy-in liquidity and the latter s 
ability to react continuously to new information one version 
of the dpm was implemented in the yahoo buzz market 
 to experimentally test the market s prediction 
properties the foundations of the msr lie in the idea of a proper 
scoring rule which is a technique to reward forecasters in 
a way that encourages them to give their best prediction 
 
the innovation in the msr is to use these scoring rules as 
instruments that can be traded thus providing traders who 
have new information an incentive to trade the msr was 
to be used in a policy analysis market in the middle east 
 which was subsequently withdrawn 
information markets rely on informed traders trading for 
their own profit so it is critical to understand the strategic 
properties of these markets this is not an easy task 
because markets are complex and traders can influence each 
other s beliefs through their trades and hence can 
potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market 
for the msr it has been shown that if we exclude the 
possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders 
it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private 
belief in her trades for the dpm we are not aware of any 
prior strategic analysis of this nature in fact a strategic 
hole was discovered while testing the dpm in the yahoo 
buzz market 
 our results 
in this paper we seek to develop an analytic method to 
guide the design and strategic analysis of information 
markets our central contribution is a new abstract betting 
game the projection 
game that serves as a useful model 
for information markets the projection game is 
conceptually simpler than the msr and dpm and thus it is easier 
to analyze in addition it has an attractive geometric 
visualization which makes the strategic moves and interactions 
more transparent we present an analysis of the optimal 
strategies and profits in this game 
we then undertake an analysis of traders costs and 
profits in the dynamic parimutuel market remarkably we find 
that the cost of a sequence of trades in the dpm is 
identical to the cost of the corresponding moves in the projection 
game further if we assume that the traders beliefs at the 
end of trading match the true probability of the event being 
predicted the traders payoffs and profits in the dpm are 
identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding 
projection game we use the equivalence between the dpm and 
the projection game to prove that the dpm is arbitrage-free 
deduce profitable strategies in the dpm and demonstrate 
that constraints on the agents trades are necessary to 
prevent a strategic breakdown 
we also prove an equivalence between the projection game 
and the msr we show that play in the msr is strategically 
equivalent to play in a restricted projection game at least 
for myopic strategies and small trades in particular the 
profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is 
exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding 
move in the projection game restricted to a circle with slight 
distortion of the prior probabilities this allows us to use the 
projection game as a conceptual model for market scoring 
rules 
we note that while the msr with the spherical scoring 
rule somewhat resembles the projection game due to the 
mathematical similarity of their profit expressions the dpm 
model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the 
projection game is especially striking further because the 
restricted projection game corresponds to a dpm with a 
natural trading constraint this sheds light on an intriguing 
connection between the msr and the dpm 
 
in an earlier version of this paper we called this the 
segment game 
lastly we illustrate how the projection game model can 
be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of 
information markets for long-term gain 
we present an example 
scenario in which such manipulation can occur and suggest 
additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of 
manipulation we also illustrate another application to analyzing 
how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy 
of a market in which traders will not trade unless their 
expected profit is above a threshold 
 related work 
numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that 
market prices are good predictors of future events and seem to 
aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders 
 this effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory 
studies and has theoretical support in the literature 
of rational expectations 
a number of recent studies have addressed the design of 
the market structure and trading rules for information 
markets as well as the incentive to participate and other 
strategic issues the two papers most closely related to our work 
are the papers by hanson and pennock however 
strategic issues in information markets have also been 
studied by mangold et al and by hanson oprea and 
porter an upcoming survey paper discusses 
costfunction formulations of automated market makers 
organization of the paper the rest of this paper is 
organized as follows in section we describe the 
projection game and analyze the players costs profits and 
optimal strategies in this game in section we study the 
dynamic parimutuel market and show that trade in a dpm 
is equivalent to a projection game we establish a 
connection between the projection game and the msr in section 
in section we illustrate how the projection game can be 
used to analyze non-myopic and potentially manipulative 
actions we present our conclusions and suggestions for 
future work in section 
 the projection game 
in this section we describe an abstract betting game the 
projection game in the following sections we will argue 
that both the msr and the dpm are strategically similar 
to the projection game the projection game is conceptually 
simpler than msr and dpm and hence should prove easier 
to analyze for clarity of exposition here and in the rest of 
the paper we assume the space is two dimensional i e there 
are only two possible events our results easily generalize 
to more than two dimensions we also assume throughout 
that players are risk-neutral 
suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
events a and b in other words b is the same as not 
a there are n agents who may have information about 
the likelihood of a and b and we the designers would like 
to aggregate their information we invite them to play the 
game described below 
at any point in the game there is a current state 
described by a pair of parameters x y which we sometimes 
write in vector form as x intuitively x corresponds to the 
 
here we are referring only to manipulation of the 
information market for later gain from the market itself we do not 
consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in 
the underlying events 
 
total holding of shares in a and y corresponds to the 
holding of shares in b in each move of the game one player 
 say i plays an arrow or segment from x y to x y 
we use the notation x y → x y or x x to 
denote this move the game starts at but the market 
maker makes the first move without loss of generality we 
can assume the move is to all subsequent moves are 
made by players in an arbitrary and potentially repeating 
sequence 
each move has a cost associated with it given by 
c x x x − x 
where · denotes the euclidean norm x 
p 
x y 
note that none of the variables are constrained to be 
nonnegative and hence the cost of a move can be negative 
the cost can be expressed in an alternative form that is 
also useful suppose player i moves from x y to x y 
we can write x y as x lex y ley such that l ≥ 
and ex 
 ey 
 we call l the volume of the move and 
 ex ey the direction of the move at any point ˆx ˆy there 
is an instantaneous price charged defined as follows 
c ˆx ˆy ex ey 
ˆxex ˆyey 
 ˆx ˆy 
 
ˆx · e 
 ˆx 
 
note that the price depends only on the angle between the 
line joining the vector ˆx ˆy and the segment x y x y 
and not the lengths the total cost of the move is the price 
integrated over the segment x y → x y i e 
c x y → x y 
z l 
w 
c x wex y wey ex ey dw 
we assume that the game terminates after a finite number 
of moves at the end of the game the true probability p of 
event a is determined and the agents receive payoffs for the 
moves they made let q qx qy p −p 
 p −p 
 the payoff 
to agent i for a segment x y → x y is given by 
p x y → x y qx x − x qy y − y q x − x 
we call the line through the origin with slope − p p 
qy qx the p-line note that the payoff too may be negative 
one drawback of the definition of a projection game is 
that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the 
actual probability p this is feasible if the probability can 
eventually be determined statistically such as when 
predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events 
or vote shares it is also feasible for one-off events in which 
there is reason to believe that the true probability is either 
 or for other one-off events it cannot be implemented 
directly unlike scoring rules which can be implemented in 
expectation however we believe that even in these cases 
the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and 
analytical tool 
the moves costs and payoffs have a natural geometric 
representation which is shown in figure for three 
players with one move each the players append directed line 
segments in turn and the payoff player i finally receives for 
a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with 
slope − p p her cost is the difference of distances of the 
endpoints of her move to the origin 
 strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame 
we begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by 
observing the following simple path-independence property

figure a projection game with three players 
lemma path-independence suppose there is a sequence 
of moves leading from x y to x y then the total 
cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move 
 x y → x y and the total payoff of all the moves is 
equal to the payoff of the single move x y → x y 
proof the proof follows trivially from the definition of 
the costs and payoffs if we consider a path from point x to 
point x both the net change in the vector lengths and the 
net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by 
x and x 
although simple path independence of profits is vitally 
important because it implies and is implied by the 
absence of arbitrage in the market in other words there is no 
sequence of moves that start and end at the same point but 
result in a positive profit on the other hand if there were 
two paths from x y to x y with different profits there 
would be a cyclic path with positive profit 
for ease of reference we summarize some more useful 
properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection 
game 
lemma 
 the instantaneous price for moving along a line through 
the origin is or − when the move is away or toward 
the origin respectively the instantaneous price along 
a circle centered at the origin is 
 when x moves along a circle centered at the origin to 
point ¯x on the positive p-line the corresponding payoff 
is p x ¯x x − x · q and the cost is c x ¯x 
 the two cost function formulations are equivalent 
c x x 
z l 
w 
cos x we e dw x − x ∀x x 
where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move 
in addition when x moves along the positive p-line 
the payoff is equal to the cost p x x x − x 
proof the instantaneous price is 
c x e x · e x cos x e 
where e is the direction of movement and the result 
follows 
 since ¯x is on the positive p-line q·¯x ¯x x hence 
p x ¯x q · ¯x − x x − x · q the cost is from 
the definition 
 
 from part the cost of moving from x to the origin 
is 
c x 
z l 
w 
cos x we e dw 
z l 
w 
 − dw − x 
where l x e x x by the path-independence 
property 
c x x c x c x x − x 
finally a point on the positive p-line gets projected 
to itself namely q · x x so when the movement 
is along the positive p-line p x x q · x − x 
 x − x c x x 
we now consider the question of which moves are 
profitable in this game the eventual profit of a move x x 
where x x l ex ey is 
profit x x p x x − c x x 
 lq e − c x x 
differentiating with respect to l we get 
d profit 
dl 
 q e − c x le e 
 q e − 
x le 
 x le 
 e 
we observe that this is if p y ley − p x lex 
in other words when the vectors q and x le are exactly 
aligned further we observe that the price is non-decreasing 
with increasing l thus along the direction e the profit is 
maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line 
by lemma there is always a path from x to the positive 
p-line with cost which is given by an arc of the circle with 
center at the origin and radius x also any movement 
along the p-line has additional profit thus for any point 
x we can define the profit potential φ x p by 
φ x p x − x · q 
note the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line 
and zero for x on the line next we show that a move to a 
lower potential is always profitable 
lemma the profit of a move x x is equal to the 
difference in potential φ x p − φ x p 
proof denote z x q and z x q i e these are 
the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the 
circles centered at the origin with radii x and x respectively 
by the path-independence property and lemma the profit 
of move x x is 
profit x x profit x z profit z z profit z x 
 x − x · q x · q − x 
 φ x p − φ x p 
thus the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit 
potential between the endpoints 
this lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to 
move to the point of lowest potential namely to the p-line 
p 
y 
 −p 
x

figure the profit of move x x is equal to the 
change in profit potential from x to x 
 dynamic parimutuel markets 
the dynamic parimutuel market dpm was introduced 
by pennock as an information market structure that 
encourages informed traders to trade early has guaranteed 
liquidity and requires a bounded subsidy this market 
structure was used in the yahoo buzz market in this 
section we show that the dynamic parimutuel market is also 
remarkably similar to the projection game coupled with 
section this also demonstrates a strong connection 
between the dpm and msr 
in a two-event dpm users can place bets on either event 
a or b at any time by buying a share in the appropriate 
event the price of a share is variable determined by the 
total amount of money in the market and the number of 
shares currently outstanding further existing shares can 
be sold at the current price after it is determined which 
event really happens the shares are liquidated for cash in 
the total-money-redistributed variant of dpm which is 
the variant used in the yahoo market the total money 
is divided equally among the shares of the winning event 
shares of the losing event are worthless note that the 
payoffs are undefined if the event has zero outstanding shares 
the dpm rules should preclude this possibility 
we use the following notation let x be the number of 
outstanding shares of a totalled over all traders and y be 
the number of outstanding shares in b let m denote the 
total money currently in the market let ca and cb denote 
the prices of shares in a and b respectively the price of a 
share in the yahoo dpm is determined by the share-ratio 
principle 
ca 
cb 
 
x 
y 
 
the form of the prices can be fully determined by 
stipulating that for any given value of m x and y there must 
be some probability pa such that if a trader believes that 
pa is the probability that a will occur and the market will 
liquidate in the current state she cannot expect to profit 
from either buying or selling either share this gives us 
ca pa 
hm 
x 
i 
cb pb 
hm 
y 
i 
 
since pa pb we have 
xca ycb m 
finally combining equations and we get 
ca x 
m 
x y 
cb y 
m 
x y 
cost of a trade in the dpm consider a trader who 
comes to a dpm in state m x y and buys or sells shares 
such that the eventual state is m x y what is the net 
cost m − m of her move 
theorem the cost of the move from x y to x y 
is 
m − m m 
p 
x y − 
p 
x y 
for some constant m in other words it is a constant 
multiple of the corresponding cost in the projection game 
proof consider the function g x y m 
p 
x y 
the function g is differentiable for all x y and it s 
partial derivatives are 
∂g 
∂x 
 m 
x 
p 
x y 
 x 
g x y 
x y 
∂g 
∂y 
 m 
y 
p 
x y 
 y 
g x y 
x y 
now compare these equations to the prices in the dpm 
and observe that as a trader buys or sells in the dpm 
the instantaneous price is the derivative of the money it 
follows that if at any point of time the dpm is in a state 
 m x y such that m g x y then at all subsequent 
points of time the state m x y of the dpm will satisfy 
m g x y finally note that we can pick the constant 
m such that the equation is satisfied for the initial state of 
the dpm and hence it will always be satisfied 
one important consequence of theorem is that the 
dynamic parimutuel market is arbitrage-free using lemma 
it is interesting to note that the original yahoo buzz market 
used a different pricing rule which did permit arbitrage the 
price rule was changed to the share-ratio rule after traders 
started exploiting the arbitrage opportunities another 
somewhat surprising consequence is that the numbers of 
outstanding shares x y completely determines the total 
capitalization m of the dpm 
constraints in the dpm although it might seem based 
on the costs that any move in the projection game has an 
equivalent move in the dpm the dpm places some 
constraints on trades firstly no trader is allowed to have a 
net negative holding in either share this is important 
because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are 
always positive however this is a boundary constraint 
and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with 
a sufficiently large positive holding in each share thus we 
can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic 
analysis of the dpm secondly for practical reasons a dpm will 
probably have a minimum unit of trade but we assume here 
that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded 
payoffs in the dpm at some point trading in the dpm 
ceases and shares are liquidated we assume here that the 
true probability becomes known at liquidation time and 
describe the payoffs in terms of the probability however if the 
probability is not revealed only the event that actually 
occurs these payoffs can be implemented in expectation 
suppose the dpm terminates in a state m x y and the true 
probability of event a is p when the dynamic parimutuel 
market is liquidated the shares are paid off in the 
following way each owner of a share of a receives pm 
x 
 and each 
owner of a share of b receives − p m 
y 
 for each share 
owned 
the payoffs in the dpm although given by a fairly 
simple form are conceptually complex because the payoff of 
a move depends on the subsequent moves before the 
market liquidates thus a fully rational choice of move in the 
dpm for player i should take into account the actions of 
subsequent players including player i himself 
here we restrict the analysis to myopic infinitesimal 
strategies given the market position is m x y in which 
direction should a player make an infinitesimal move in order to 
maximize her profit we show that the infinitesimal payoffs 
and profits of a dpm with true probability p correspond 
strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a 
projection game with odds 
p 
p − p in the following sense 
lemma suppose player i is about to make a move in 
a dynamic parimutuel market in a state m x y and the 
true probability of event a is p then assuming the market 
is liquidated after i s move

proof consider the cost and payoff of buying a small 
quantity δx of shares in a the cost is c x y → x 
δx y δx · x m 
x y and the payoff is δx · pm 
x 
 thus 
buying the shares is profitable iff 
δx · x

thus buying a is profitable if x

 and selling a

 the analysis for buying or selling 
b is similar with p and − p interchanged 
it follows from lemma that it is myopically profitable 
for players to move towards the line with slope

p 
 note 
that there is a one-to-one mapping between −p 
p 
and 
q 
 −p 
p 
 
in their respective ranges so this line is uniquely defined 
and each such line also corresponds to a unique p 
however because the actual payoff of a move depends on the 
future moves players must base their decisions on some belief 
about the final state of the market in the light of lemma 
one natural rational-expectation style assumption is that 
the final state m x

 will satisfy x

 in other 
words one might assume that the traders beliefs will

this is very plausible in markets such as the yahoo buzz 
market in which trading is permitted right until the market 
is liquidated at which point there is no remaining 
uncertainty about the relevant frequencies under this 
assumption we can prove an even tighter connection between 
payoffs in the dpm where the true probability is p and payoffs 
in the projection game with odds

strategic analysis for the dpm theorems and 
give us a very strong equivalence between the projection 
game and the dynamic parimutuel market under the 
assumption that the dpm converges to the optimal value for 
the true probability a player playing in a dpm with true 
odds p − p can imagine himself playing in the 
projection game with odds 
q 
p 
 −p 
 because both the costs and the 
payoffs of any given move are identical 
using this equivalence we can transfer all the strategic 
properties proven for the projection game directly to the 
analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market one 
particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows in 
the absence of any constraint that disallows it it is always 
profitable for an agent to move towards the origin by selling 
shares in both a and b while maintaining the ratio x y in 
the dpm this is limited by forbidding short sales so 
players can never have negative holdings in either share as a 
result when their holding in one share say a is they 
can t use the strategy of moving towards the origin we can 
conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of 
both a and b simultaneously regardless of her beliefs and 
the market position 
this discussion leads us to consider a modified dpm in 
which this strategic loophole is addressed directly instead 
of disallowing all short sales we place a constraint that no 
agent ever reduce the total market capitalization m or 
alternatively that any agent s total investment in the market 
is always non-negative we call this the nondecreasing 
market capitalization constraint for the dpm this 
corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game 
reduces the radius however we can conclude from the 
preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever 
increase the radius thus the moves of the projection game 
would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant 
with radius determined by the market maker s move in 
section we show that the projection game on this 
quarter circle is strategically equivalent at least myopically to 
trade in a market scoring rule thus the dpm and msr 
appear to be deeply connected to each other like different 
interfaces to the same underlying game 
 market scoring rules 
the market scoring rule msr was introduced by 
hanson it is based on the concept of a proper scoring rule a 
technique which rewards forecasters to give their best 
prediction hanson s innovation was to turn the scoring rules into 
instruments that can be traded thereby providing traders 
who have new information an incentive to trade one 
positive effect of this design is that a single trader would still 
have incentive to trade which is equivalent to updating the 
scoring rule report to reflect her information thereby 
eliminating the problem of thin markets and illiquidity in this 
section we show that when the scoring rule used is the 
spherical scoring rule there is a strong strategic 
equivalence between the projection game and the market scoring 
rule 
proper scoring rules are tools used to reward forecasters 
who predict the probability distribution of an event we 
describe this in the simple setting of two exhaustive 
mutually exclusive events a and b in the simple setting of 
two exhaustive mutually exclusive events a and b proper 
scoring rules are defined as follows suppose the forecaster 
predicts that the probabilities of the events are r ra rb 
with ra rb the scoring rule is specified by functions 
sa ra rb and sb ra rb which are applied as follows if 
the event a occurs the forecaster is paid sa ra rb and if 
the event b occurs the forecaster is paid sb ra rb the 
key property that a proper scoring rule satisfies is that the 
expected payment is maximized when the report is identical 
to the true probability distribution 
 equivalence with spherical scoring rule 
in this section we focus on one specific scoring rule the 
spherical scoring rule 
definition the spherical scoring rule is defined 
by 
si r 
def 
 ri r for two events this can be written as 
sa ra rb 
ra 
p 
r 
a r 
b 
 sb ra rb 
rb 
p 
r 
a r 
b 
the spherical scoring rule is known to be a proper scoring 
rule the definition generalizes naturally to higher 
dimensions 
we now demonstrate a close connection between the 
projection game restricted to a circular arc and a market scoring 
rule that uses the spherical scoring rule at this point it is 
 
convenient to use vector notation let x x y denote a 
position in the projection game we consider the projection 
game restricted to the circle x 
restricted projection game consider a move in this 
restricted projection game from x to x recall that q 
 p 
√ 
p −p 
 −p 
√ 
p −p 
 where p is the true probability 
of the event then the projection game profit of a move 
 x x is q · x − x noting that x x 
we can extend this to an arbitrary collection 
of not 
necessarily contiguous moves 
x x x x x · · · xl xl 
seg-profitp x

spherical scoring rule profit we now turn our 
attention to the msr with the spherical scoring rule ssr 
consider a player who changes the report from r to r then if 
the true probability of a is p her expected profit is 
ssr-profit r r p sa r −sa r −p sb r −sb r 
now let us represent the initial and final position in terms 
of circular coordinates for r ra rb define the 
corresponding coordinates x ra√ 
r 
a r 
b 
 rb√ 
r 
a r 
b 
 note that 
the coordinates satisfy x and thus correspond to valid 
coordinates for the restricted projection game 
now let p denote the vector p − p then 
expanding the spherical scoring functions sa sb the player s profit 
for a move from r to r can be rewritten in terms of the 
corresponding coordinates x x as 
ssr-profit x x p · x − x 
for any collection x of moves the total payoff in the ssr 
market is given by 
ssr-profitp x 
x 
 x x ∈x 
p · x − x 
 p · 
 
 
x 
 x x ∈x 
 x − x 
 
 
finally we note that p and q are related by q μpp 
where μp 
p 
p − p is a scalar that depends only 
on p this immediately gives us the following strong 
strategic equivalence for the restricted projection game and the 
ssr market 
theorem any collection of moves x yields a 
positive negative payoff in the restricted projection game iff x 
yields a positive negative payoff in the spherical scoring 
rule market 
proof as derived above 
seg-profitp x μpssr-profitp x 
for all p ≤ μp ≤ 
√ 
 or more generally for an 
ndimensional probability vector p ≤ μp 
 p 
≤ 
√ 
n by 
the arithmetic mean-root mean square inequality and the 
result follows immediately 
 
we allow the collection to contain repeated moves i e it 
is a multiset 
although theorem is stated in terms of the sign of the 
payoff it extends to relative payoffs of two collections of 
moves 
corollary consider any two collections of moves x 
x then x yields a greater payoff than x in the projection 
game iff x yields a greater payment than x in the ssr 
market 
proof every move x x has a corresponding inverse 
move x x in both the projection game and the ssr the 
inverse move profit is simply the negative profit of the move 
 the moves are reversible we can define a collection of 
moves x x − x by adding the inverse of x to x note 
that 
seg-profitp x seg-profitp x −seg-profitp x 
and 
ssr-profitp x ssr-profitp x −ssr-profitp x 
applying theorem completes the proof 
it follows that the ex post optimality of a move or set of 
moves is the same in both the projection game and the ssr 
market on its own this strong ex post equivalence is not 
completely satisfying because in any non-trivial game there 
is uncertainty about the value of p and the different scaling 
ratios for different p could lead to different ex ante optimal 
behavior we can extend the correspondence to settings 
with uncertain p as follows 
theorem consider the restricted projection game with 
some prior probability distribution f over possible values of 
p then there is a probability distribution g with the same 
support as f and a strictly positive constant c that depends 
only on f such that 
 i for any collection x of moves the expected profits 
are related by 
ef seg-profit x ceg ssr-profit x 
 ii for any collection x and any measurable 
information set i ⊆ the expected profits conditioned 
on knowing that p ∈ i satisfy 
ef seg-profit x p ∈ i ceg ssr-profit x p ∈ i 
the converse also holds for any probability distribution g 
there is a distribution f such that both these statements are 
true 
proof for simplicity assume that f has a density 
function f the result holds even for non-continuous 
distributions then let c 
r 
 
μpf p dp define the density 
function g of distribution g by 
g p 
μpf p 
c 
now for a collection of moves x 
ef seg-profit x 
z 
seg-profitp x f p dp 
 
z 
ssr-profitp x μpf p dp 
 
z 
ssr-profitp x cg p dp

analysis of msr strategies theorem provides the 
foundation for analysis of strategies in scoring rule markets 
to the extent that strategies in these markets are 
independent of the specific scoring rule used we can use the 
spherical scoring rule as the market instrument then analysis 
of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted 
distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic 
properties of the original market situation 
implementation in expectation another important 
consequence of theorem is that the restricted projection 
game can be implemented with a small distortion in the 
probability distribution over values of p by using a spherical 
scoring rule to implement the payoffs this makes the 
projection game valuable as a design tool for example we can 
analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game 
and then implement them via the ssr unfortunately the 
result does not extend to unrestricted projection games 
because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus 
changing radius is not preserved through this 
transformation however it is possible to extend the transformation 
to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move 
is a fixed function of i not necessarily constant so that it 
is not within the strategic control of the player making the 
move such games can also be strategically implemented via 
the spherical scoring rule with distortion of priors 
 connection to other scoring rules 
in this section we show a weaker similarity between the 
projection game and the msr with other scoring rules we 
prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted 
projection game and the msr with log scoring rule the result 
generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique 
local and global maximum 
a geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in 
two dimensions is depicted in figure the score curves in 
the figure are defined by s r s r r r − r r ∈ 
 similarly to the projection game define the profit 
potential of a probability r in msr to be the change in 
profit for moving from r to the optimum p φmsr s r p 
profitmsr s r s p we will show that the profit 
potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing 
the optimal strategies in particular both potential functions 
have a global minimum at r p 
theorem consider the projection game restricted to 
the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the 
natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions

since r r − r is a probability distribution this 
expression is positive for r p and negative for r p as desired 
now consider the projection game on the non-negative 
unit circle the potential for any x r

 −r 
 r 
 is given by 
φ x r p x − q · x r 
it is easy to show that d 
dr 
φ x r p for r p and the 
derivative is positive for r p so the potential function 
along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r 
similarly to an energy function with a global minimum at 
r p as desired 
theorem establishes that the market log-scoring rule 
is strategically similar to the projection game played on a 
circle in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at 
the current state is the same in both games for example 
if the current state is r p it is profitable to move to 
r dr since the effective profit of that move is profit r r 
φ s r p − φ s r dr p although stated for 
logscoring rules the theorem holds for any scoring rules that 
induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum 
at p such as the quadratic scoring rule and others 
 using theprojection-gamemodel 
the chief advantages of the projection game are that it 
is analytically tractable and also easy to visualize in 
section we used the projection-game model of the dpm to 
prove the absence of arbitrage and to infer strategic 
properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise 
in this section we provide two examples that illustrate the 
power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about 
more complex strategic settings 
 
 traders with inertia 
the standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the 
market forms we have studied asserts that traders who 
disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from 
changing the probability and thus have a strict incentive to 
trade in the market the expected gain may however be 
very small a plausible model of real trader behavior might 
include some form of inertia or -optimality we assume 
that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than 
some constant we do not attempt to justify this model 
here rather we illustrate how the projection game may be 
used to analyze such situations and shed some light on how 
to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem 
consider the simple projection game restricted to a 
circular arc with unit radius as we have seen this 
corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule and 
to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable 
constraint now suppose the market probability is p and a 
trader believes the true probability is p then his expected 
gain can be calculated as follows let q and q be the unit 
vectors in the directions of p and p respectively the 
expected profit is given by e φ q p − q ·q thus the 
trader will trade only if −q·q if we let θ and θ be the 
angles of the p-line and p -line respectively from the x-axis 
we get e − cos θ − θ when θ is close to θ a taylor 
series approximation gives us that e ≈ θ − θ 
 thus 
we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy 
the market price will not change as long as θ − θ 
≤ 
now suppose a market operator faced with this situation 
wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market one natural 
approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant 
this corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection 
game and would indeed improve the accuracy however it 
will also increase the market-maker s exposure to loss the 
market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve 
this 
the projection game model suggests a natural approach 
to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds 
on the market maker s loss the idea is that instead of 
restricting all moves to being on the unit circle we force 
each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous 
move suppose we insist that if the current radius is r 
the next trader has to move to r then the trader s 
expected profit would be e r − cos θ − θ using 
the same approximation as above the trader would trade 
as long as θ − θ 
 r now even if the market maker 
seeded the market with r it would increase with each 
trade and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase 
with every trade 
 analyzing long-term strategies 
up to this point our analysis has been restricted to trader 
strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not 
consider the impact of their trades on other traders 
beliefs in practice an informed trader can potentially profit 
by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders 
in a way that allows her to profit later in this section we 
illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze 
an instance of this phenomenon and to design market rules 
that mitigate this effect 
the scenario we consider is as follows there are two 
traders speculating on the probability of an event e who 
each get a -bit signal the optimal probability for each 
 bit signal pair is as follows if trader gets the signal and 
trader gets signal the optimal probability is if trader 
 got a but trader got a the optimal probability is 
 if trader gets and trader gets signal the optimal 
probability is if trader got a but trader got a the 
optimal probability is note that the impact of trader 
 s signal is in a different direction depending on trader s 
signal suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is 
that trader is equally likely to get a or a but trader 
gets a with probability and a with probability 
the traders are playing the projection game restricted to a 
circular arc this setup is depicted in figure

figure example illustrating non-myopic 
deception 
suppose that for some exogenous reason trader has the 
opportunity to trade followed by trader then trader 
has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before 
the market closes if traders were playing their myopically 
optimal strategies here is how the market should run if 
trader sees a he would move to some point y that is 
between a and c but closer to c trader would then 
infer that trader received a signal and move to a or c if 
she got or respectively trader has no reason to move 
again if trader had got a he would move to a different 
point x instead and trader would move to d if she saw 
and b if she saw again trader would not want to move 
again 
using the projection game it is easy to show that if 
traders consider non-myopic strategies this set of 
strategies is not an equilibrium the exact position of the points 
does not matter all we need is the relative position and the 
observation that because of the perfect symmetry in the 
setup segments xy bc and ad are all parallel to each 
other now suppose trader got a he could move to 
x instead of y to mislead trader into thinking he got a 
 then when trader moved to say d trader could 
correct the rating to a to show that this is a profitable 
deviation observe that this strategy is equivalent to 
playing two additional moves over trader s myopic strategy of 
moving to y the first move y x may either move toward 
or away from the optimal final position the second move 
da or bc is always in the correct direction further 
because da and bc are longer than xy and parallel to xy 
their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 
 
in absolute value than the projection of xy regardless of 
what the true p-line is thus the deception would result in 
a strictly higher expected profit for trader note that this 
problem is not specific to the projection game form our 
equivalence results show that it could arise in the msr or 
dpm perhaps with a different prior distribution and 
different numerical values observe also that a strategy profile 
in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds and 
trader moved to either x or y would be a subgame-perfect 
equilibrium in this setup 
we suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem 
might be by reducing the radius at every move this 
essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 
to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 
graphically the right reduction factor would make the segments 
ad and bc shorter than xy as they are chords on a 
smaller circle thus making the myopic strategy optimal 
 conclusions and future work 
we have presented a simple geometric game the 
projection game that can serve as a model for strategic behavior 
in information markets as well as a tool to guide the 
design of new information markets we have used this model 
to analyze the cost profit and strategies of a trader in a 
dynamic parimutuel market and shown that both the 
dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring 
rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection 
game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities 
the general analysis was based on the assumption that 
traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future 
profit in section however we analyze a small example 
market without this assumption we demonstrate that the 
projection game can be used to analyze traders strategies 
in this scenario and potentially to help design markets with 
better strategic properties 
our results raise several very interesting open questions 
firstly the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly 
implemented in situations in which the true probability is 
not ultimately revealed it would be very useful to have an 
automatic transformation of a given projection game into 
another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in 
expectation without knowing the probability and preserves 
the strategic properties of the projection game second 
given the tight connection between the projection game and 
the spherical market scoring rule it is natural to ask if we 
can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if 
not to understand what strategic differences are implied by 
the form of the scoring rule used in the market finally the 
existence of long-range manipulative strategies in 
information markets is of great interest the example we studied 
in section merely scratches the surface of this area a 
general study of this class of manipulations together with a 
characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise 
would be very useful for the design of information markets
