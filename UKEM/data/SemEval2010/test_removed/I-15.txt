finding the right agents in a large and dynamic network to 
provide the needed resources in a timely fashion is a long 
standing problem this paper presents a method for information 
searching and sharing that combines routing indices with 
tokenbased methods the proposed method enables agents to search 
effectively by acquiring their neighbors interests advertising 
their information provision abilities and maintaining indices for 
routing queries in an integrated way specifically the paper 
demonstrates through performance experiments how static and 
dynamic networks of agents can be  tuned to answer queries 
effectively as they gather evidence for the interests and 
information provision abilities of others without altering the 
topology or imposing an overlay structure to the network of

 introduction 
considering to be a decentralized control problem information 
searching and sharing in large-scale systems of cooperative agents 
is a hard problem in the general case the computation of an 
optimal policy when each agent possesses an approximate partial 
view of the state of the environment and when agents 
observations and activities are interdependent i e one agent s 
actions affect the observations and the state of an other is 
hard this fact has resulted to efforts that either require agents to 
have a global view of the system to heuristics to 
precomputation of agents information needs and information 
provision capabilities for proactive communication to 
localized reasoning processes built on incoming information 
 and to mathematical frameworks for coordination 
whose optimal policies can be approximated for small sub- 
networks of associated agents 
on the other hand there is a lot of research on semantic peer to 
peer search networks and social networks 
many of which deal with tuning a network of peers for effective 
information searching and sharing they do it mostly by imposing 
logical and semantic overlay structures however as far as we 
know there is no work that demonstrates the effectiveness of a 
gradual tuning process in large-scale dynamic networks that 
studies the impact of the information gathered by agents as more 
and more queries are issued and served in concurrent sessions in 
the network 
the main issue in this paper concerns  tuning a network of 
agents each with a specific expertise for efficient and effective 
information searching and sharing without altering the topology 
or imposing an overlay structure via clustering introduction of 
shortcut indices or re-wiring   is the task of sharing and 
gathering the knowledge for agents to propagate 
requests to the acquaintances minimizing the searching 
effort increasing the efficiency and the benefit of the system 
specifically this paper proposes a method for information 
searching and sharing in dynamic and large scale networks which 
combines routing indices with token-based methods for 
information sharing in large-scale multi-agent systems 
this paper is structured as follows section presents related 
work and motivates the proposed method section states the 
problem and section presents in detail the individual techniques 
and the overall proposed method section presents the 
experimental setup and results and section concludes the paper 
sketching future work

information provision and sharing can be considered to be a 
decentralized partially-observable markov decision process 
 in the general case decentralized control of 
largescale dynamic systems of cooperative agents is a hard problem 
optimal solutions can only be approximated by means of 
heuristics by relaxations of the original problem or by centralized 
solutions the computation of an optimal control policy is simple 
given that global states can be factored that the probability of 
transitions and observations are independent the observations 
combined determine the global state of the system and the reward 
function can be easily defined as the sum of local reward 
functions 
however in a large-scale dynamic system with decentralized 
control it is very hard for agents to possess accurate partial views 
of the environment and it is even more hard for agents to possess 
a global view of the environment furthermore agents 
observations can not be assumed independent as one agent s 
actions can affect the observations of others for instance when 
one agent joins leaves the system then this may affect other 
agents assessment of neighbours information provision abilities 
furthermore the probabilities of transitions can be dependent too 
something that increases the complexity of the problem for 
example when an agent sends a query to another agent then this 
may affect the state of the latter as far as the assessed interests of 
the former are concerned 
considering independent activities and observations authors in 
 propose a decision-theoretic solution treating standard action 
and information exchange as explicit choices that the decision 
maker must make they approximate the solution using a myopic 
algorithm their work differs in the one reported here in the 
following aspects first it aims at optimizing communication 
while the goal here is to tune the network for effective 
information sharing reducing communication and increasing 
system s benefit second the solution is approximated using a 
myopic algorithm but authors do not demonstrate how 
suboptimal are the solutions computed something we neither do 
given their interest to the optimal solution third they consider 
that transitions and observations made by agents are independent 
which as already discussed is not true in the general case last 
in contrast to their approach where agents broadcast messages 
here agents decide not only when to communicate but to whom 
to send a message too 
token based approaches are promising for scaling coordination 
and therefore information provision and sharing to large-scale 
systems effectively in authors provide a mathematical 
framework for routing tokens providing also an approximation to 
solving the original problem in case of independent agents 
activities the proposed method requires a high volume of 
computations that authors aim to reduce by restricting its 
application to static logical teams of associated agents in 
accordance to this approach in information sharing is 
considered only for static networks and self-tuning of networks is 
not demonstrated as it will be shown in section our 
experiments show that although these approaches can handle 
information sharing in dynamic networks they require a larger 
amount of messages in comparison to the approach proposed here 
and can not tune the network for efficient information sharing 
proactive communication has been proposed in as a result of 
a dynamic decision theoretic determination of communication 
strategies this approach is based on the specification of agents as 
providers and needers this is done by a plan-based 
precomputation of information needs and provision abilities of 
agents however this approach can not scale to large and 
dynamic networks as it would be highly inefficient for each agent 
to compute and determine its potential needs and information 
provision abilities given its potential interaction with s of 
other agents 
viewing information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems from a 
multi-agent system perspective the approach proposed in is 
based on a language model of agents documents collection 
exploiting the models of other agents in the network agents 
construct their view of the network which is being used for 
forming routing decisions initially agents build their views using 
the models of their neighbours then the system reorganizes by 
forming clusters of agents with similar content clusters are being 
exploited during information retrieval using a knn approach and 
a gradient search scheme although this work aims at tuning a 
network for efficient information provision through 
reorganization it does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
approach with respect to this issue moreover although during 
reorganization and retrieval they measure the similarity of content 
between agents a more fine grained approach is needed that 
would allow agents to measure similarities of information items 
or sub-collections of information items however it is expected 
that this will complicate re-organization based on their work on 
peer-to-peer systems h zhand and v lesser in study 
concurrent search sessions dealing with static networks they 
focus on minimizing processing and communication bottlenecks 
although we deal with concurrent search sessions their work is 
orthogonal to ours which may be further extended towards 
incorporating such features in the future 
considering research in semantic peer-to-peer systems 
 most of 
the approaches exploit what can be loosely stated a routing 
index a major question concerning information searching is 
what information has to be shared between peers when and 
what adjustments have to be made so as queries to be routed to 
trustworthy information sources in the most effective and efficient 
way 
remindin peers gather information concerning the queries 
that have been answered successfully by other peers so as to 
subsequently select peers to forward requests to this is a lazy 
learning approach that does not involve advertisement of peer 
information provision abilities this results in a tuning process 
where the overall recall increases over time while the number of 
messages per query remains about the same here agents actively 
advertise their information provision abilities based on the 
assessed interests of their peers this results in a much lower 
number of messages per query than those reported in 
remindin 
in peers using a common ontology advertise their expertise 
which is being exploited for the formation of a semantic overlay 
network queries are propagated in this network depending on 
their similarity with peers expertise it is on the receiver s side to 
decide whether it shall accept or not an advertisement based on 
the similarity between expertise descriptions according to our 
approach agents advertise selectively their information provision 
abilities about specific topics to their neighbours with similar 
information interests and only to these however this is done as 
time passes and while agents receive requests from their peers 
the gradual creation of overlay networks via re-wiring shortcuts 
creation or clustering of peers are tuning 
approaches that differ fundamentally from the one proposed here 
through local interactions we aim at tuning the network for 
efficient information provision by gathering routing information 
gradually as queries are being propagated in the network and 
 
general research in peer-to-peer systems concentrates either on 
network topologies or on distribution of documents 
approaches do not aim to optimize advertising and search 
mostly requires common keys for nodes and their contents 
they generate a substantial overhead in highly dynamic 
settings where nodes join leave the system 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
agents advertise their information provision abilities given the 
interests of their neighbours given the success of this method we 
shall study how the addition of logical paths and gradual 
evolution of the network topology can further increase the 
effectiveness of the proposed method 
 problem statement 
let be the set of agents in the system the 
network of agents is modelled as a graph where is the 
set of agents and is a set of bidirectional edges denoted as 
nonordered pairs the neighbourhood of an agent includes 
all the one-hop away agents i e its acquaintance agents such 
that the set of acquaintances of is denoted by 
each agent maintains a an ontology that represents categories of 
information b indices of information pieces available to its local 
database and to other agents and c a profile model for some of 
its acquaintances indices and profile models are described in 
detail in section 
ontology concepts represent categories that classify the 
information pieces available it is assumed that agents in the 
network share the same ontology but each agent has a set of 
information items in its local repository which are classified 
under the concepts of its expertise the set of concepts is denoted 
by it is assumed that the sets of items in agents local 
repositories are non-overlapping 
finally it is assumed that there is a set of queries 
each query is represented by a tuple where is 
the unique identity of the query is a non-negative integer 
representing the maximum number of information pieces 
requested is the specific category to which these pieces must 
belong is a path in the network of agents through which the 
query has been propagated initially it contains the originator of 
the query and each agent appends its id in the before 
propagating the query and is a positive integer that specifies 
the maximum number of hops that the query can reach in case 
this limit is exceeded and the corresponding number of 
information pieces have not been found then the query is 
considered unfulfilled however even in this case a possibly 
high percentage of the requested pieces of information may have 
been found 
the problem that this article deals with is as follows given a 
network of agents and a set of queries agents must 
retrieve the pieces of information requested by queries in 
concurrent search sessions and further  tune the network so as to 
answer future similar queries in the more effective and efficient 
way increasing the benefit of the system and reducing the 
communication messages required the of the system is 
the ratio of information pieces retrieved to the number of 
information pieces requested the of the system is 
measured by the number of messages needed for searching and 
updating the indexes and profiles maintained 
 tuning the network requires agents to acquire the necessary 
information about acquaintances interests and information 
provision abilities i e the routing and profiling tuples detailed in 
section so as to route queries and further share information in 
the most efficient way this must be done seamlessly to 
searching i e agents in the network must share acquire the 
necessary information while searching increasing the benefit and 
efficiency gradually as more queries are posed 
 information searching and 
sharing 
 overall method 
given a network of agents and a set of queries each 
agent maintains indices for routing queries to the right agents 
as well as acquaintances profiles for advertising its information 
provision abilities to those interested 
to capture information about pieces of information accessible by 
the agents each agent maintains a routing index that is realized 
as a set of tuples of the form each such tuple specifies 
the number of information items in category that can be 
reached by such that this specifies 
the of to with respect to the 
information category as it can be noticed each tuple 
corresponds either to the agent itself specifying the pieces of 
information classified in available to its local repository or to 
an acquaintance of the agent recording the pieces of information 
in category available to the acquaintance agent and to agents 
that can be reached through this acquaintance the routing index 
is exploited for the propagation of queries to the right agents 
those that are either more likely to provide answers or that know 
someone that can provide the requested pieces of information 
considering an agent the profile model of some of its 
acquaintances denoted by is a set of tuples 
maintained by such a tuple specifies the probability that the 
acquaintance is interested to pieces of information in category 
subsequently such a probability is also denoted by 
formally the profile model of an acquaintance of is 
 and profile models are 
exploited by the agents to decide where to  advertise their 
information provision abilities 
given two acquaintances and in the information 
searching and sharing process proceeds as it is depicted in figure 
 initially each agent has no knowledge about the information 
provision abilities of its acquaintances and also it possesses no 
information about their interests when that the query 
is sent to from the agent then has to 
update the profile of concerning the category increasing the 
probability that is interested to information in when this 
probability is greater than a threshold value due to the queries 
about that has sent to then assesses that it is highly

two acquaintances numbers show the sequence of tasks

probable for to be interested about information in category 
this leads to inform about its information provision abilities 
as far as the category is concerned this information is being 
used by to update its index about this index is being 
exploited by to further propagate queries and it is further 
propagated to those interested in moreover the profile of 
maintained by guides to propagate changes concerning its 
information provision abilities to 
the above method has the following features a it combines 
routing indices and token-based information sharing techniques 
for efficient information searching and sharing without imposing 
an overlay network structure b it can be used by agents to adapt 
safely and effectively to dynamic networks c it supports the 
acquisition and exploitation of different types of locally available 
information for the  tuning process d it extends the 
tokenbased method for information sharing as it was originally 
proposed in in two respects first to deal with categories 
of information represented by means of ontology concepts and not 
with specific pieces of information and second to guide agents to 
advertise information that is semantically similar to the 
information requested by using a semantic similarity measure 
between information categories therefore it paves the way for 
the use of token-based methods for semantic peer-to-peer 
systems this is further described in section d it provides a 
more sophisticated way for agents to update routing indices than 
that originally proposed in this is done by gathering and 
exploiting acquaintances profiles for effective information 
sharing avoiding unnecessary and cyclic updates that may result 
to misleading information about agents information provision 
abilities this is further described in the next sub-section 
 routing indices 
as already specified given a network of agents and the 
set of agent s acquaintances the routing index ri of 
 denoted by is a collection of at most 
indexing tuples the key idea is that given such an index 
and a request concerning will forward this request to if the 
resources available i e the information abilities of to 
can best serve this request to compute the information abilities 
of to all tuples concerning all agents in - 
must be aggregated crespo and garcia-molina examine 
various types of aggregations in this paper given some tuples 
   maintained by the agent their 
aggregation is the tuple this gives 
information concerning the pieces of information that can be 
provided through but it does not distinguish what each of s 
acquaintances can provide this is an inherent feature of routing 
indices without considering the interests of its acquaintances 
may compute aggregations concerning agents in - 
and advertise share its information provision abilities to each 
agent in 
for instance given the network configuration depicted in figure 
and a category agent sends the aggregation of the tuples 
concerning agents in - denoted as 
 to agent which records the tuple 
 similarly the aggregation of the tuples concerning the 
agents in - denoted as is 
sent to the agent which also records the tuple it must 
be noticed that and record the information provision 
abilities of each from its own point of view every time the 
tuple that models the information provision abilities of an agent 
changes the aggregation has to re-compute and send the new 
aggregation to the appropriate neighbors in the way described 
above then its neighbors have to propagate these updates to 
their acquaintances and so on 
figure aggregating and sharing information provision 
indices 
routing indices may be misleading and lead to inefficiency in 
arbitrary graphs containing cycles the exploitation of 
acquaintances profiles can provide solutions to these 
deficiencies each agent propagates its information provision 
abilities concerning a category only to these acquaintances that 
have high interest in this category as it has been mentioned an 
agent expresses its interest in a category by propagating queries 
about it therefore indices concerning a category are 
propagated in the inverse direction in the paths to which queries 
about are propagated indices are propagated as long as agents 
in the path have a high interest in queries can not be 
propagated in a cyclic fashion since an agent serves and 
propagates queries that have not been served by it in a previous 
time point therefore due to their relation to queries indices are 
not propagated in a cyclic fashion as well however there is still 
a specific case where cycles can not be avoided such a case is 
shown in figure 
figure cyclic pattern for the sharing of indices 
while the propagation of the query causes the propagation of 
information provision abilities of agents in a non cyclic way 
 since the agent a recognizes that has been served the query 
causes the propagation of information abilities of a to other 
agents in the network causing in conjunction to the propagation 
of indices due to a cyclic update of indices 
 profiles 
the key assumption behind the exploitation of acquaintances 
profiles as it was originally proposed in is that for an 
agent to pass a specific information item this agent has a high 
interest on it or to related information as already said in our 
case acquaintances profiles are created based on received 
queries and specify the interests of acquaintances to specific 
information categories given the query sent 
from to has to record not only the interest of to but

based on previous works we choose and as optimal 
values it must be noticed that we measure similarity between 
sub-concepts assigning a very low similarity value between 
concepts that are not related by the sub-concept relation this is 
due to that each query about information in category can be 
answered by information in any sub-category of close enough

agent interested in is also interested in while

according to the first case of the equation the probability that the 
agent that has propagated a query about to be interested about 
information in is updated based on the similarity between 
and the second case updates the interests of agents other than 
the requesting one in a way that ensures that normalization 
works it must be noticed that in contrast to the 
computation has been changed in favour to the agent that passed 
the query 
the profiles of acquaintances enable an agent to decide where and 
which advertisements to be sent specifically for each 
and for which is greater than a threshold value currently 
set to the agent aggregates the vectors of each 
agent - and sends the tuple to also 
given a high when a change to an index concerning occurs 
 e g due to a change in s local repository or due to that the set 
of its acquaintances changed sends the updated aggregated 
index entry to doing so the agent which is highly interested 
to pieces of information in category updates its index so as to 
become aware of the information provision abilities of as far as 
the category is concerned 
 tuning 
tuning is performed seamlessly to searching as agents propagate 
queries to be served their profiles are getting updated by their 
acquaintances as their profiles are getting updated agents 
receive the aggregated indices of their acquaintances becoming 
aware of their information provision abilities on information 
categories to which they are probably interested given these 
indices agents further propagate queries to acquaintances that are 
more likely to serve queries and so on concerning the routing 
index and the profiles maintained by an agent it must be 
pointed that does not need to record all possible tuples i e 
 it records only those that are of particular interest 
for searching and sharing information depending on the expertise 
and interests of its own and its acquaintances 
initially agents do not possess profiles of their acquaintances for 
indices there are two alternatives either agents do not initially 
possess any information about acquaintances local repositories 
 this is the case or they do this is 
the case given a query agents 
propagate this query to those acquaintances that have the highest 
information provision abilities in the no initialization of indices 
case where an agent does not initially possess information about 
its acquaintances abilities it may initially propagate a query to 
all of them resulting to a pure flooding approach or it may 
propagate the query randomly to a percentage of them in the 
initialization of indices case where an agent initially possesses 
information about its acquaintances local repository it can 
propagate queries to all or to a percentage of those that can best 
serve the request we considered both cases in our experiments 
given a static setting where agents do not shift their expertise 
and the distribution of information pieces does not change the 
network will eventually reach a state where no information 
concerning agents information abilities will need to be 
propagated and no agents profiles will need to be updated 
queries shall be propagated only to those agents that will lead to a 
near-to-the-maximum benefit of the system in a very efficient 
way in a dynamic setting agents may shift their expertise their 
interests they may leave the network at will or welcome new 
agents that join the network and bring new information provision 
abilities new interests and new types of queries in this paper we 
study settings where agents may leave or join the network this 
requires agents to adapt safely and effectively towards this goal 
in case an agent does not receive a reply from one of its 
acquaintances within a time interval then it retracts all the indices 
and the profile concerning the missing acquaintance and 
repropagates the queries that have been sent to the missing agent 
since the last successful handshake to other agents in case a new 
agent joins the network then its acquaintances that are getting 
aware of its presence propagate all the queries that have processed 
by them in the last time points currently is set to to the 
newcomer this is done so as to inform the newcomer about their 
interests and initiate information sharing 
 experimental setup 
to validate the proposed approach we have built a prototype that 
simulates large networks to test the scalability of our approach 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
we have run several experiments with various types of networks 
here we present results from network types with 
 and that provide representative cases networks 
are constructed by distributing randomly agents in an area 
each with a visibility ratio equal to the acquaintances of an 
agent are those that are visible to the agent and those from 
which the agent is visible since edges in the network are 
bidirectional details about networks are given in table the 
column avg n a shows the average number of acquaintances 
per agent in the network and the column t shows the number of 
queries per network type it must be noticed that the typea 
network is more dense than the others which are much larger 
than this 
each experiment ran times in each run the network is 
provided with a new set of randomly generated queries that are 
originated from randomly chosen agents the agents search and 
gather knowledge that they further use and enrich tuning the 
network gradually run by run each run lasts a number of rounds 
that depends on the of queries and on the parameters that 
determine the dynamics of the network to end a run all queries 
must have either been served i e of the information 
items requested must have been found or they must have been 
unfulfilled i e have exceeded their it must be noticed that 
in case of a dynamic setting this ending criterion causes some of 
the queries to be lost this is the case when some queries are 
the only active remained and the agents to whom they have 
been propagated left the network without their acquaintances to 
be aware of it

information used in the experiments is synthetic and is being

comprises a unique information category for the category in its 
expertise each agent holds at most information pieces the 
exact number of which is determined randomly 
at each run a constant number of queries are being generated 
depending on the type of network used last column in table 
at each run each query is randomly assigned to an originator 
agent and is set to request a random number of information items 
classified in a sub-category of the query-originator agent s

requested items are less than the for any query is set to 
be equal to in such a setting the demand for information items 
is much higher than the agents information provision abilities 
given the of queries the maximum benefit in any 
experimental case is much less than this has been done so as 
to challenge the  tuning task in settings where queries can not be 
served in the first hop or after - hops 
given that agents are initially not aware of acquaintances local

several evaluation experiments for each network type depending 
on the percentage of acquaintances to which a query can be

results computed in each experiment show the number of 
querypropagation messages the number of messages for 
the update of indices the of the system i e 
the average ratio of information pieces provided to the number of 
pieces requested per query and the i e the ratio of 
benefit to the total number of messages the horizontal axis in 
each diagram corresponds to the runs 
as it is shown in figure as agents search and share information 
from run to run they manage to increase the benefit of the 
system by drastically reducing the number of messages also not 
shown here due to space reasons the number of unfulfilled 
queries decrease while the served queries increase gradually 
experiments show a an effective tuning of the networks as 
time passes and more queries are posed to the network even if 
agents maintain the models of a small percentage of their 
acquaintances b that  tuning can greatly facilitate the 
scalability of the information searching and sharing tasks in 
networks 
to show whether initial knowledge about acquaintances local 
repository the case affects the 
effective tuning of the network we provide representative results 
from the typeb- network as it is shown in figure the 
tuning task in this case does not manage to achieve the benefit of 
the system reported for the case on 
the contrary while the tuning affects the drastically 
the are not affected in the same way the 
in the case are less than those in the 
typeb- with case this is further 
shown in a more clear way in the message gain of both 
approaches the message gain of the typeb- with 
 case is higher than the message gain for 
the typeb- experiment with 
therefore initial knowledge concerning local information of 
acquaintances can be used for guiding searching and tuning at the 
initial stages of the tuning task only if we need to gain efficiency 
 i e decrease the number of required messages to the cost of 
loosing effectiveness i e have lower benefit this is due to the 
fact that as agents posses information about acquaintances local 
repositories the tuning process enables the further exchange of 
messages concerning agents information provision abilities 
in cases where agents profiles provide evidence for such a need 
however initial information about acquaintances local 
repositories may mislead the searching process resulting in low 
benefit in case we need to gain effectiveness to the cost of 
reducing efficiency this type of local knowledge does not suffice 
considering also the information sharing method without routing 
indices cases we can see that for static networks 
it requires more without managing to tune the 
system while the benefit is nearly the same to the one reported by 
our method this is shown clearly in the message gain diagrams 
in figure 
figure provides results for dynamic networks these are results 
from a particular representative case of our experiments where 
more than of randomly chosen nodes leave the network in 
each run during the experiment after a random number of

rounds a new node may replace the one left this newcomer has 
no information about the network approximately of the 
nodes that leave the network are not replaced for of the 
experiment and approximately are not replaced for more 
than of the experiment in such a highly dynamic setting 
with very scarce information resources distributed in the network 
as figure shows the tuning approach has managed to keep the 
benefit to acceptable levels while still reducing drastically the 
number of i-messages however as it can be expected this 
reduction is not so drastic as it was in the corresponding static 
cases figure shows that the message gain for the dynamic case 
is comparable to the message gain for the corresponding 
 typec static case which proves the value of this approach for 
dynamic settings the comparison to the case where no routing 
indices are exploited reveals the same results as in the static case 
to the cost of a large number of messages 
finally it must be pointed that the maximum number of messages 
per query required by the proposed method is nearly which is 
less than that that reported by other efforts 
 conclusions 
this paper presents a method for semantic query processing in 
large networks of agents that combines routing indices with 
information sharing methods the presented method enables 
agents to keep records of acquaintances interests to advertise 
their information provision abilities to those that have a high 
interest on them and to maintain indices for routing queries to 
those agents that have the requested information provision 
abilities specifically the paper demonstrates through extensive 
performance experiments a how networks of agents can be 
 tuned so as to provide requested information effectively 
increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system b how 
different types of local knowledge number local information 
repositories percentage interests and information provision 
abilities of acquaintances can guide agents to effectively answer 
queries balancing between efficiency and efficacy c that the 
proposed tuning task manages to increase the efficiency of 
information searching and sharing in highly dynamic and large 
networks d that the information gathered and maintained by 
agents supports efficient and effective information searching and 
sharing initial information about acquaintances information 
provision abilities is not necessary and a small percentage of 
acquaintances suffices 
further work concerns experimenting with real data and 
ontologies differences in ontologies between agents shifts in 
expertise and the parallel construction of overlay structure
