 introduction 
recent advances in computing hardware and software are 
responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of 
observing the environment processing the data and making 
decisions based on the observations such a network can 
be used to monitor the environment detect classify and 
locate specific events and track targets over a specific region 
examples of such systems are in surveillance monitoring of 
pollution traffic agriculture or civil infrastructures the 
deployment of sensor networks varies with the application 
considered it can be predetermined when the environment 
is sufficiently known and under control in which case the 
sensors can be strategically hand placed the deployment 
can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is 
unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be 
airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means 
generally resulting in a random placement 
this paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor 
networks performing target detection over a region of 
interest in order to detect a target moving through the region 
sensors have to make local observations of the environment 
and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the 
status of the region covered this collaboration requires 
local processing of the observations communication between 
different nodes and information fusion since the local 
observations made by the sensors depend on their position 
the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of 
the deployment one possible measure of the goodness of 
deployment for target detection is called path exposure it is 
a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing 
the region using a given path the higher the path 
exposure the better the deployment the set of paths to be 
considered may be constrained by the environment for 
example if the target is expected to be following a road only 
the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered 
in this study the deployment is assumed to be random 
which corresponds to many practical applications where the 
region to be monitored is not accessible for precise 
placement of sensors the focus of this paper is to determine the 
number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target 
detection in a region of interest the tradeoffs lie between the 
network performance the cost of the sensors deployed and 
the cost of deploying the sensors this paper is organized 
as follows in section a definition for path exposure is 
proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given 
path is developed in section the problem of random 
deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented 
an analytical study of these solutions is given in section 
and section presents simulation results that are used in 
section to determine the optimum solution for a given 
environment the paper concludes with section 
 path exposure 
in this section a model for sensor network target detection 
is proposed a definition of path exposure is presented and 
expressions for evaluating this path exposure are developed 
 model 
consider a rectangular sensor field with n sensors 
de 
ployed at locations si i n a target at location 
u emits a signal which is measured by the sensors the 
signal from the target decays as a polynomial of the distance 
if the decay coefficient is k the signal energy of a target at 
location u measured by the sensor at si is given by 
si u 
k 
 u − si k 
 
where k is the energy emitted by the target and u − si 
is the geometric distance between the target and the sensor 
depending on the environment the value k typically ranges 
from to 
energy measurements at a sensor are usually corrupted 
by noise if ni denotes the noise energy at sensor i during a 
particular measurement then the total energy measured at 
sensor i when the target is at location u is 
ei u si u ni 
k 
 u − si k 
 ni 
the sensors collaborate to arrive at a consensus decision as 
to whether a target is present in the region we consider two 
basic approaches for reaching this consensus value fusion 
and decision fusion in value fusion one of the sensors 
gathers the energy measurements from the other sensors 
totals up the energy and compares the sum to a threshold 
to decide whether a target is present if the sum exceeds 
the threshold then the consensus decision is that a target 
is present in contrast in decision fusion each individual 
sensor compares its energy measurement to a threshold to 
arrive at a local decision as to whether a target is present 
the local decisions for target present and otherwise 
from the sensors are totaled at a sensor and the sum is 
compared to another threshold to arrive at the consensus 
decision in some situations value fusion outperforms decision 
fusion and vice versa

target is at location u is

where η is the value fusion threshold if the noise processes 
at the sensors are independent then the probability density 
function of n 
i ni equals the convolution of the 
probability density function of ni i n in particular if 
the noise process at each sensor is additive white gaussian 
noise awgn then n 
i ni has a chi-square distribution 
of degree n 
due to the presence of noise the sensors may incorrectly 
decide that a target is present even though there is no 
target in the field the probability of a consensus false target 
detection is 
fv prob 
n

ni ≥ η 
as above if the noise processes at the sensors are 
independent and awgn then the false alarm probability can be 
computed from the chi-square distribution of degree n

detection when the target is located at u is

where

 prob ni ≥ η −

and 
p prob hd i u 
 − prob hd i u 
can be computed from chi-square distribution of degree 
for awgn noise process 
the probability of false target detection at sensor i is 
prob gd i prob ni ≥ η and 
prob gd i − prob gd i 
therefore the probability of consensus false target detection 
is

the above equations serve as an analytic basis for 
evaluating exposure as defined in the following subsection 
note that in value and decision fusion the knowledge of the 
sensors location can be used to make the detection decision 
for example a sensor can report values that differ 
substantially from its neighbors values this discrepancy can be 
analyzed to avoid false alarms or misses and therefore 
improve the detection performance however such algorithms 
are not considered in this paper 
 de£nition of exposure 
we define exposure to be the probability of detecting the 
target or an intruder carrying out the unauthorized activity 
where the activity depends on the problem under 
consideration in this paper the activity considered is the 
unauthorized traversal ut as defined below 
unauthorized traversal ut problem we are given 
a sensor field with n sensors at locations s s sn see 
figure we are also given the stochastic characterization 
of the noise at each sensor and a tolerable bound α on the 
false alarm probability let p denote a path from the west to 
the east periphery of the sensor field a target traversing the 
sensor field using path p is detected if it is detected at some 
point u ∈ p the exposure of path p is the net probability 
of detecting a target that traverses the field using p the 
target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the 
field and the problem is to find the path p with the least 
exposure 
 
sensor 
figure example sensor fields for ut problem 
 solution to the ut problem 
let p denote a path from the west to the east 
periphery through the sensor field a target that traverses the 
field using p is not detected if and only if it is not detected 
at any time while it is on that path since detection 
attempts by the sensor network occur at a fixed frequency we 
can associate each detection attempt with a point u ∈ p 
when assuming that the target traverses the field at a 
constant speed the detection attempts are based on energy 
measured over a period of time t during which the target 
is moving therefore the detection probability associated 
with each point u reflects the measurements performed 
during time t considering the path the net probability of not 
detecting a target traversing the field using p is the 
product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u ∈ p 
that is if g p denotes the net probability of not detecting 
a target as it traverses over path p then 
log g p 
u∈p 
log − d u du 
where d u is either dv u of dd u depending on whether 
the sensors use value or decision fusion to arrive at a 
consensus decision since the exposure of p is − g p the 
problem is to find the path which minimizes − g p or 
equivalently the path that minimizes log g p 
 
in general the path p that minimizes log g p can be 
fairly arbitrary in shape the proposed solution does not 
exactly compute this path instead we rely on the following 
approximation we first divide the sensor field into a fine 
grid and then assume that the target only moves along this 
grid the problem then is to find the path p on this grid 
that minimizes log g p note that the finer the grid the 
closer the approximation also one can use higher order 
grids such as in instead of the rectangular grid we use 
in this paper the higher order grids change the runtime 
of the algorithm but the approach is the same as with the 
rectangular grid 
for the target not to be detected at any point u ∈ p 
 
note that g p lies between and and thus log g p is 
negative 
 generate a suitably fine rectangular grid 
 for each line segment l between adjacent grid points

 assign l a weight equal to log ml

 add a link from virtual point a to each grid point on 
the west 
 add a link from virtual point b to each grid point on 
the east 
 assign a weight of to all the line segments from a 
and b 
 compute the least weight path p from a to b using 
dijkstra s algorithm 
 let w equal the total weight of p 
 return p as the least exposure path with an 
exposure equal to −w 
 
figure pseudo-code of the proposed solution for 
the ut problem 
it need not be detected at any point u lying between any 
two adjacent grid points of p we therefore subdivide any 
path p as a chain of grid segments let us consider two 
adjacent points say v and v on the grid let l denote 
the line segment between v and v also let ml denote 
the probability of not detecting a target traveling between 
v and v on the line segment l then from the discussion 
above 
log ml 
u∈l 
log − d u du 
the probability ml can be evaluated by finding the detection 
probability d u at each point u ∈ l note that ml lies 
between and and therefore log ml is negative 
to find the least exposed path a non-negative weight 
equal to log ml is assigned to each segment l on this grid 
also a fictitious point a is created and a line segment is 
added from a to each grid point on the west periphery of 
the sensor field a weight equal to is assigned to each of 
these line segments similarly a fictitious point b is created 
and a line segment is added from b to each grid point on 
the east periphery of the sensor field a weight equal to 
is assigned to each of these line segments 
the problem of finding the least exposed path from west 
periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem 
of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid such 
a path can be efficiently determined using the dijkstra s 
shortest path algorithm a pseudo-code of the overall 
algorithm is shown in figure 
example figure shows a sensor field with eight sensors 
at locations marked by dark circles assume the noise 
process at each sensor is additive white gaussian with mean 
 and variance further assume that the sensors use value 
fusion to arrive at a consensus decision then from

 deployment 
in this section the problem of sensor deployment for 
unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are 
identified 
 problem formulation 
consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized 
traversal using a sensor network the target to traverse the sensor 
field emits a given energy level k and the stochastic of the 
noise in the region is known the sensors are to be deployed 
over the region in a random fashion where the sensors 
locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the 
number or density of sensors can be chosen the problem is 
to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired 
performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the 
region 
this performance is measured by the false alarm 
probability and the path exposure defined in section the false 
alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement 
and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed 
and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms it is 
assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists 
of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate 
since targets can traverse the region through any path the 
goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least 
exposed path in the region 
obviously the minimum exposure in the region increases 
 if false alarm rate is kept constant as more sensors are 
deployed in the region however since the deployment is 
random there are no guarantees that the desired exposure 
level is achieved for a given number of sensors indeed some 
sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability 
in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same 
vicinity a study of the statistical distribution of exposure 
for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors 
can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level 
is achieved in practical situations only a limited number 
of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited 
detection level with associated confidence level is achievable 
at a given false alarm rate 
 solution 
based on the above discussion we develop a solution method 
to the deployment problem when a maximum of m sensors 
can be used deploying the m sensors results in the 
maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when 
considering the cost of sensors to reduce the number of 
sensors deployed only part of the available sensors can be 
deployed first and the sensors can then report their position 
the random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to 
determine if it satisfies the desired performance level if it 
does not additional sensors can be deployed until the 
desired exposure level is reached or until the all m available 
sensors are deployed 
the number of sensors used in this strategy can be 
minimized by deploying one sensor at a time however a cost is 
usually associated with each deployment of sensors and 
deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the 
cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the 
cost of single sensors by assigning a cost to both single 
sensors and deployment the optimal number of sensors to be 
deployed at first and thereafter can be determined in the 
next section we develop analytical expressions for finding 
the optimal solution in general the optimal cost solution 
is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all 
the sensors at a time 
 analytical solution 
in this section we derive an analytical model for the cost 
of deployment let ed be the desired minimum exposure for 
the sensor network to be deployed when a maximum of m 
sensors are available for deployment the position of sensors 
are random in the region of interest r and for a given 
num

 and sensors 
ber of sensors n the least exposure e is a random variable 
let fn x denote the cumulative distribution function of e 
that is the probability that e is less than x when n sensors 
are deployed 
as mentioned in the previous section there is no a priori 
guarantee that the exposure ed will be obtained when 
deploying the sensors if m is the maximum number of sensors 
available the confidence of obtaining a least exposure of ed 
or more is −fm ed for the proposed solution we assume 
that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment 
is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the 
minimum exposure ed is not reached to evaluate the 
probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor 
deployment we make the following approximation the 
distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the 
exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors ≤ k ≤ n − 
this is an approximation since the exposure obtained with 
n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with 
only k of these n sensors ≤ k ≤ n − we observed 
that the re-deployment of just a few sensors can 
substantially modify the coverage of the region for example when 
filling empty spaces the approximation is also justified by 
the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions 
indeed a given minimum exposure can correspond to many 
different deployment positions some of which can be easily 
improved by deploying a few additional sensors e g when 
there is a empty space in the region coverage some of which 
can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors 
 e g when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region 
as the minimum exposure e is a random variable the cost 
of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure 
is reached is also a random variable c we now derive the 
expression for the expected value of c let ni be the total 
number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum 
number of steps s so that ns m note that ni − ni− 
is the number of sensors deployed at step i also let cd be 
the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and cs be the 
cost of each sensor if the desired exposure is obtained after 
the first step the cost of deployment is cd n cs and this

note that a different expression is needed for the cost of

 simulation 
in this section we present results of simulations that were 
conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of 
the number of sensors deployed 
 method 
the exposure distribution is obtained by collecting 
statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a 
predefined region the random deployment is assumed to 
be uniformly distributed over the region which is a local 
approximation for every deployment the minimum exposure 
is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm 
presented in section a decay factor of k and maximum 
energy of k are chosen to model the energy emitted 
by targets cf equation the region monitored is of size 
 × with a noise awgn of variance so that the signal 
coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 
 or more units length away from a sensor the sensors use 
value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision 
on the presence of a target in the region the threshold for 
detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors 
to give a constant false alarm probability the false alarm 
probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the 
probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of 
length units corresponding to detection attempts by 
the sensors is

figure expected cost of achieving minimum exposure of as function of the number of sensors for 
three different cost assignments 
 distribution of minimum exposure 
the distribution of minimum exposure were found for the 
number of sensor deployed varying from to to 
illustrate our results the probability density functions for 
and sensors are shown in figure 
we observe that for sensors deployed the minimum 
exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm 
probability of the highest density is obtained for 
values around and then drops exponentially towards zero 
for higher values of exposure for deployment of sensors 
we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density 
for values below then increases and has about constant 
density for values lying between and we also observe 
a peak of density around for deployment of sensors 
densities start at zero for small values and remain very small 
for most values of minimum exposure the density slowly 
increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 
as expected the minimum exposure increases on average 
as the number of sensors deployed increases when 
randomly deploying sensors it is very unlikely to obtain a 
placement providing a desirable minimum exposure when 
deploying sensors most of the exposure levels are equally 
likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a 
desirable exposure level when deploying sensors it is very 
likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and 
this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors 
deployed 
we use the cumulative distribution function obtained from 
the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the 
desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of 
sensors the graph of figure shows the probability that 
the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the 
number of sensors deployed for ed and 
these values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in 
equation the graph shows that the confidence level to 
obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the 
number of sensors deployed the confidence for ed when 
deploying sensors is above which is sufficient for most 
applications and therefore we did not evaluate the 
distribution of exposure when deploying more than sensors 
 results 
in this section we evaluate the expected cost of deploying 
sensors using the simulation results the optimal number 
of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can 
be derived from these results 
for this cost analysis the region parameters and signal 
model are the same as specified in section we further 
assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step 
is constant so that ni − ni− n for all ≤ i ≤ s in this 
case equation reduces to 
e c cd n cs

we evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for 
three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of 
ed the three corresponding graphs are shown in 
figure the first cost assignment is cd cs so 
that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to 
be used to achieve an exposure of since cd the 
number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesn t affect the 
cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time 
until the minimum exposure ed is reached as we observe on 
the graph overall the expected number of sensor to be 
 
deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum 
for n that can be explained by the following analysis 
the expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i n ≤ 
i ≤ s that are the different number of sensors than can 
be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each 
step for n around the probability that the minimum 
exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in figure and the 
weight associated with the first term of the sum n increases 
rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of 
sensors decrease this is the cause of the local minimum 
and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n 
compensates for the decrease in weights 
the second cost assignment is cd cs so that 
the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors 
 note that only the relative cost of cd cs determines the 
shape of the graphs in this case deploying one sensor at a 
time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal 
number of sensors to deploy at every step is again we 
find that the curve presents a local minimum for n that 
is due to the variations in weights the last cost assignment 
is cd cs and the minimum cost is achieved 
when deploying sensors at every step 
these results are specific to the region and the parameters 
characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were 
chosen for the simulation similar results can be derived for 
other parameters most of the effort residing in finding the 
exposure distributions through simulation 
 conclusion 
this paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment 
in a region to be monitored for target intrusion a 
mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection 
is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths 
through the region the minimum exposure is used as a 
measure of the goodness of deployment the goal being to 
maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the 
region 
in the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region 
to be monitored a mechanism for sequential deployment in 
steps is developed the strategy consists of deploying a 
limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum 
exposure is achieved the cost function used in this study 
depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and 
the cost of each deployment through simulation the 
distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random 
deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed 
these results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment 
for varying number of sensors deployed in each step 
we found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in 
each step varies with the relative cost assigned to 
deployment and sensors the results of this study can be extended 
to larger regions with different target parameters the 
solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by 
considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step 
and this multiple variables problem requires further 
investigation
