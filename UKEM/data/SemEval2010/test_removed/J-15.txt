abstract 
multiattribute auction mechanisms generally either remain 
agnostic about traders preferences or presume highly restrictive forms 
such as full additivity real preferences often exhibit 
dependencies among attributes yet may possess some structure that can be 
usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify 
operation of a multiattribute auction we develop such a structure 
using the theory of measurable value functions a cardinal utility 
representation based on an underlying order over preference 
differences a set of local conditional independence relations over 
such differences supports a generalized additive preference 
representation which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of 
related attributes we introduce an iterative auction mechanism that 
maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full 
space of joint configurations when traders preferences are 
consistent with the auction s generalized additive structure the 
mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations at approximate

 introduction 
multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional price-only 
mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined 
attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal rather 
than negotiating over a fully defined good or service a 
multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations 
until the most promising candidates are identified for example 
a procurement department of a company may use a multiattribute 
auction to select a supplier of hard drives supplier offers may be 
evaluated not only over the price they offer but also over various 
qualitative attributes such as volume rpm access time latency 
transfer rate and so on in addition suppliers may offer different 
contract conditions such as warranty delivery time and service 
in order to account for traders preferences the auction 
mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain 
of multidimensional configurations constructing and 
communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden 
for even a moderate number of attributes therefore practical 
multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications 
or support compact expression of preferences assuming some 
simplified form by far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt 
is the simplest an additive representation where overall value is a 
linear combination of values associated with each attribute for 
example several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions 
 require additive preference representations 
such additivity reduces the complexity of preference 
specification exponentially compared to the general discrete case but 
precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes in 
practice however interdependencies among natural attributes are 
quite common for example the buyer may exhibit complementary 
preferences for size and access time since the performance effect 
is more salient if much data is involved or may view a strong 
warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings similarly the 
seller s production characteristics such as increasing access time 
is harder for larger hard drives can easily violate additivity in 
such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide 
even a reasonable approximation of real preferences 
on the other hand fully general models are intractable and it 
is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some 
structure our goal therefore is to identify the subtler yet more 
widely applicable structured representations and exploit these 
properties of preferences in trading mechanisms 
we propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a 
flexible preference structure our approach is inspired by the 
design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive 
preferences due to parkes and kalagnanam pk pk 
propose two types of iterative auctions the first nld makes no 
assumptions about traders preferences and lets sellers bid on the full 
multidimensional attribute space because nld maintains an 
exponential price structure it is suitable only for small domains the 
other auction ad assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost 
functions it collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single 
discount term the price of a configuration is defined as the sum of 
the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount 
the auction we propose also supports compact price spaces 
albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons we 
employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive 
independence gai a model flexible enough to accommodate 
interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired yet 
providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence 
can be limited given its roots in multiattribute utility theory 
 
the gai condition is defined with respect to the expected utility 
function to apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes 
therefore requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty 
to this end we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated 
with continuous prices which provide a natural scale for assessing 
magnitude of preference 
we first lay out a representation framework for preferences that 
captures in addition to simple orderings among attribute 
configuration values the difference in the willingness to pay wtp for each 
that is we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also 
decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference 
in price next we build a direct formally justified link from 
preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive 
decomposition of the wtp function after laying out this 
infrastructure we employ this representation tool for the development of a 
multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to 
express their complex preferences in gai format we then study the 
auction s allocational computational and practical properties 
in section we present essential background on our 
representation framework the measurable value function mvf section 
develops new multiattribute structures for mvf supporting 
generalized additive decompositions next we show the applicability of 
the theoretical framework to preferences in trading the rest of the 
paper is devoted to the proposed auction mechanism 
 multiattribute preferences 
as mentioned most tools facilitating expression of multiattribute 
value for trading applications assume that agents preferences can 
be represented in an additive form by way of background we start 
by introducing the formal prerequisites justifying the additive 
representation as provided by multiattribute utility theory we then 
present the generalized additive form and develop the formal 
underpinnings for measurable value needed to extend this model to 
the case of choice under certainty 
 preferential independence 
let θ denote the space of possible outcomes with a 
preference relation weak total order over θ let a a am 
be a set of attributes describing θ capital letters denote subsets 
of variables small letters with or without numeric subscripts 
denote specific variables and ¯x denotes the complement of x with 
respect to a we indicate specific variable assignments with prime 
signs or superscripts to represent an instantiation of subsets x y 
at the same time we use a sequence of instantiation symbols as in 
x y 
definition a set of attributes y ⊂ a is preferentially 
independent pi of its complement z a \ y if the conditional 
preference order over y given a fixed level z 
of z is the same 
regardless of the choice of z 
 
in other words the preference order over the projection of a on the 
attributes in y is the same for any instantiation of the attributes in 
z 
definition a a am is mutually preferentially 
independent mpi if any subset of a is preferentially independent 
of its complement 
the preference relation when no uncertainty is modeled is 
usually represented by a value function v the following 
fundamental result greatly simplifies the value function representation 
theorem a preference order over set of attributes 
a has an additive value function representation 
v a am 
mx 
i 
vi ai 
iff a is mutually preferential independent 
essentially the additive forms used in trading mechanisms assume 
mutual preferential independence over the full set of attributes 
including the money attribute intuitively that means that willingness 
to pay for value of an attribute or attributes cannot be affected by 
the value of other attributes 
a cardinal value function representing an ordering over certain 
outcomes need not in general coincide with the cardinal utility 
function that represents preference over lotteries or expected utility 
 eu nevertheless eu functions may possess structural 
properties analogous to that for value functions such as additive 
decomposition since the present work does not involve decisions under 
uncertainty we do not provide a full exposition of the eu concept 
however we do make frequent reference to the following additive 
independence relations 
definition let x y z be a partition of the set of attributes 
a x and y are conditionally additive independent given z 
denoted as cai x y z if preferences over lotteries on a depend 
only on their marginal conditional probability distributions over x 
and y 
definition let i ig ⊆ a such that 
sg 
i ii a 
i ig are called generalized additive independent gai if 
preferences over lotteries on a depend only on their marginal 
distributions over i ig 
an expected utility function u · can be decomposed additively 
according to its possibly overlapping gai sub-configurations 
theorem let i ig be gai then there exist 
functions f fg such that 
u a am 
g 
x 
r 
fr ir 
what is now known as the gai condition was originally 
introduced by fishburn for eu and was named gai and brought to 
the attention of ai researchers by bacchus and grove 
graphical models and elicitation procedures for gai decomposable utility 
were developed for eu for a cardinal representation of 
the ordinal value function and for an ordinal preference 
relations corresponding to a tcp-net structure by brafman et al 
apart from the work on gai in the context of preference handling 
that were discussed above gai have been recently used in the 
context of mechanism design by hyafil and boutilier as an aid in 
direct revelation mechanisms 
as shown by bacchus and grove gai structure can be 
identified based on a set of cai conditions which are much easier to 
detect and verify in general utility functions may exhibit gai 
structure not based on cai however to date all proposals for 
reasoning and eliciting utility in gai form take advantage of the gai 
structure primarily to the extent that it represents a collection of 
cai conditions for example gai trees employ triangulation 
of the cai map and braziunas and boutilier s conditional set 
cj of a set ij corresponds to the cai separating set of ij 
since the cai condition is also defined based on preferences 
over lotteries we cannot apply bacchus and grove s result 
without first establishing an alternative framework based on priced 
outcomes we develop such a framework using the theory of 
measurable value functions ultimately producing a gai decomposition 
 
 eq of the wtp function readers interested primarily in the 
multiattribute auction and willing to grant the well-foundedness of 
the preference structure may skip down to section 
 measurable value functions 
trading decisions represent a special case of decisions under 
certainty where choices involve multiattribute outcomes and 
corresponding monetary payments in such problems the key decision 
often hinges on relative valuations of price differences compared 
to differences in alternative configurations of goods and services 
theoretically price can be treated as just another attribute 
however such an approach fails to exploit the special character of the 
money dimension and can significantly add to complexity due to 
the inherent continuity and typical wide range of possible monetary 
outcome values 
we build on the fundamental work of dyer and sarin on 
measurable value functions mvfs as we show below wtp 
functions in a quasi-linear setting can be interpreted as mvfs however 
we first present the mvf framework in a more generic way where 
the measurement is not necessarily monetary we present the 
essential definitions and refer to dyer and sarin for more detailed 
background and axiomatic treatment the key concept is that of 
preference difference let θ 
 θ 
 ϑ 
 ϑ 
∈ θ such that θ 
θ 
and ϑ 
ϑ 
 θ 
 θ 
 denotes the preference difference between 
θ 
and θ 
 interpreted as the strength or degree to which θ 
is 
preferred over θ 
 let 
denote a preference order over θ × θ we 
interpret the statement 
 θ 
 θ 
 
 ϑ 
 ϑ 
 
as the preference of ϑ 
over ϑ 
is at least as strong as the 
preference of θ 
over θ 
 we use the symbol ∼ 
to represent equality of 
preference differences 
definition u d → is a measurable value function 
 mvf wrt 
if for any θ 
 θ 
 ϑ 
 ϑ 
∈ d 
 θ 
 θ 
 
 ϑ 
 ϑ 
 ⇔ 
u θ 
 − u θ 
 ≤ u ϑ 
 − u ϑ 
 
note that an mvf can also be used as a value function representing 
 since θ θ 
 θ θ iff θ θ 
definition attribute set x ⊂ a is called 
difference independent of ¯x if for any two assignments x ¯x x ¯x 
 x ¯x x ¯x ∼ 
 x ¯x x ¯x 
for any assignment ¯x 
or in words the preference differences on assignments to x given 
a fixed level of ¯x do not depend on the particular level chosen for 
¯x 
as with additive independence for eu this condition is stronger 
than preferential independence of x also analogously to eu 
mutual preferential independence combined with other conditions 
leads to additive decomposition of the mvf moreover dyer and 
sarin have defined analogs of utility independence for 
mvf and worked out a parallel set of decomposition results 
 advanced mvf structures 
 conditional difference independence 
our first step is to generalize definition to a conditional 
version 
definition let x y z be a partition of the set of attributes 
a x is conditionally difference independent of y given z 
denoted as cdi x y z if 
∀ instantiations ˆz x 
 x 
 y 
 y 
 x 
y ˆz x 
y ˆz ∼ x 
y ˆz x 
y ˆz 
since the conditional set is always the complement we sometimes 
leave it implicit using the abbreviated notation cdi x y 
cdi leads to a decomposition similar to that obtained from cai 
 
lemma let u a be an mvf representing preference 
differences then cdi x y z iff 
u a u x 
 y z u x y 
 z − u x 
 y 
 z 
to complete the analogy with cai we generalize lemma as 
follows 
proposition cdi x y z iff there exist functions 
ψ x z and ψ y z such that 
u x y z ψ x z ψ y z 
an immediate result of proposition is that cdi is a symmetric 
relation 
the conditional independence condition is much more 
applicable than the unconditional one for example if attributes a ∈ x 
and b ∈ x are complements or substitutes x cannot be difference 
independent of ¯x however x \ a may still be cdi of ¯x given 
a 
 gai structure for mvf 
a single cdi condition decomposes the value function into two 
parts we seek a finer-grain global decomposition of the utility 
function similar to that obtained from mutual preferential 
independence for this purpose we are now ready to employ the results 
of bacchus and grove who establish that the cai condition 
has a perfect map that is there exists a graph whose nodes 
correspond to the set a and its node separation reflects exactly the 
complete set of cai conditions on a moreover they show that the 
utility function decomposes over the set of maximal cliques of the 
perfect map their proofs can be easily adapted to cdi since they 
only rely on the decomposition property of cai that is also implied 
by cdi according to proposition 
theorem let g a e be a perfect map for the cdi 
conditions on a then 
u a 
g 
x 
r 
fr ir 
where i ig are overlapping subsets of a each 
corresponding to a maximal clique of g 
given theorem we can now identify an mvf gai structure 
from a collection of cdi conditions the cdi conditions in turn 
are particularly intuitive to detect when the preference differences 
carry a direct interpretation as in the case with monetary 
differences discussed below moreover the assumption or detection of 
cdi conditions can be performed incrementally until the mvf is 
decomposed to a reasonable dimension this is in contrast with the 
fully additive decomposition of mvf that requires mutual 
preferential independence 
theorem defines a decomposition structure but to represent 
the actual mvf we need to specify the functions over the cliques 
 
the next theorem establishes that the functional constituents of 
mvf are the same as those for gai decompositions as defined by 
fishburn for eu we adopt the following conventional 
notation let a 
 a 
m be a predefined vector called the reference 
outcome for any i ⊆ a the function u i stands for the 
projection of u a to i where the rest of the attributes are fixed at their 
reference levels 
theorem let g a e be a perfect map for the cdi 
condition on a and i ig a set of maximal cliques as 
defined in theorem then the functional decomposition from that 
theorem can be defined as 
f u i and for r g 
fr u ir 
r− x 
k 
 − k 
x 
 ≤i ··· ik r 
u 
k\ 
s 
iis ∩ ir 
the proof directly shows that if graph g a e is a perfect 
map of cdi u a decomposes to a sum over the functions defined 
in 
thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result 
of theorem only on the existence of the perfect map 
to summarize the results of this section generalize additive mvf 
theory in particular it justifies the application of methods recently 
developed under the eu framework to representation 
of value under certainty 
 willingness-to-pay as an mvf 
 construction 
in this section we apply measurable value to represent 
differences of willingness to pay for outcomes we assume that the agent 
has a preference order over outcome space represented by a set of 
attributes a and an attribute p representing monetary consequence 
note that in evaluating a purchase decision p would correspond to 
the agent s money holdings net of the transaction i e wealth 
after purchase not the purchase price an outcome in this space is 
represented for example by θ p where θ is an instantiation of 
a and p is a value of p we further assume that preferences are 
quasi-linear in p that is there exists a value function of the form 
v a p u a l p where l is a positive linear function 
the quasi-linear form immediately qualifies money as a 
measure of preference differences and establishes a monetary scale for 
u a 
definition let v a p u a l p represent where 
p is the attribute representing money we call u a a 
willingnessto-pay wtp function 
note that wtp may also refer to the seller s willingness to accept 
function the wtp u a is a cardinal function unique up to a 
positive linear transformation since 
 θ p θ p ⇔ u θ − u θ ≤ l p − p 
 where θ θ ∈ θ the domain of a the wtp function can be used 
to choose among priced outcomes 
 
this proof and most other proofs in this paper are omitted for 
space consideration and are available in an online appendix 
 
in many procurement applications the deals in question are small 
relative to the enterprises involved so the quasi-linearity 
assumption is warranted this assumption can be relaxed to a condition 
called corresponding tradeoffs which does not require the 
value over money to be linear to simplify the presentation 
however we maintain the stronger assumption 
naturally elicitation of wtp function is most intuitive when 
using direct monetary values in other words we elicit a function in 
which l p p so v a p u a p we define a reference 
outcome θ 
 p 
 and assuming continuity of p for any assignment 
ˆθ there exists a ˆp such that ˆθ ˆp ∼ θ 
 p 
 as v is normalized 
such that v θ 
 p 
 ˆp is interpreted as the wtp for ˆθ or the 
reserve price of ˆθ 
proposition the wtp function is an mvf over differences 
in the reserve prices 
we note that the wtp function is used extensively in economics 
and that all the development in section could be performed 
directly in terms of wtp relying on quasi-linearity for preference 
measurement and without formalization using mvfs this 
formalization however aligns this work with the fundamental 
difference independence theory by dyer and sarin 
in addition to facilitating the detection of gai structure the cdi 
condition supports elicitation using local queries similar to how 
cai is used by braziunas and boutilier we adopt their 
definition of conditional set of ir noted here sr as the set of neighbors 
of attributes in ir not including the attributes of ir clearly sr is 
the separating set of ir in the cdi map hence cdi ir vr where 
vr a \ ir ∪ sr from the definition of cdi for any v 
r v 
r 
we have 
u i 
r s 
r v 
r − u i 
r s 
r v 
r u i 
r s 
r v 
r − u i 
r s 
r v 
r 
eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the 
utility wtp of one full outcome the reference outcome θ 
 and then 
obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary 
differences between its possible assignments technique known as 
pricing out keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed 
these ceteris paribus elicitation queries are local in the sense that 
the agent does not need to consider the values of the rest of the 
attributes furthermore in eliciting mvfs we can avoid the global 
scaling step that is required for eu functions since the preference 
differences are extracted with respect to specific amounts of the 
attribute p the utility is already scaled according to that external 
measure hence once the conditional utility functions u ij are 
obtained we can calculate u a according to 
this last step may require in the worst case computation of a 
number of terms that is exponential in the number of max cliques 
in practice however we do not expect the intersection of the cliques 
to go that deep intersection of more than just a few max cliques 
would normally be empty to take advantage of that we can use the 
search algorithm suggested by braziunas and boutilier which 
efficiently finds all the nonempty intersections for each clique 
 optimization 
as shown the wtp function can be used directly for pairwise 
comparisons of priced outcomes another preference query often 
treated in the literature is optimization or choice of best outcome 
possibly under constraints 
typical decisions about exchange of a good or service exhibit 
what we call first-order preferential independence fopi under 
which most or all single attributes have a natural ordering of quality 
independent of the values of the rest 
for example when 
choosing a pc we always prefer more memory faster cpu longer 
warranty and so on under fopi the unconstrained optimization of 
 
this should not be mistaken with the highly demanding 
condition of mutual preferential independence that requires all tradeoffs 
between attributes to be independent 
 
unpriced outcomes is trivial hence we consider choice among 
attribute points with prices since any outcome can be best given 
enough monetary compensation this problem is not well-defined 
unless the combinations are constrained somehow 
a particularly interesting optimization problem arises in the 
context of negotiation where we consider the utility of both buyers and 
sellers the multiattribute matching problem mmp is 
concerned with finding an attribute point that maximizes the surplus of 
a trade or the difference between the utilities of the buyer and the 
seller ub a − us a gai as an additive decomposition has the 
property that if ub and us are in gai form then ub a −us a is in 
gai form as well we can therefore use combinatorial optimization 
procedures for gai decomposition based on the well studied 
variable elimination schemes e g to find the best trading point 
similarly this optimization can be done to maximize surplus 
between a trader s utility function and a pricing system that assigns a 
price to each level of each gai element and this way guide traders 
to their optimal bidding points in the rest of the paper we develop 
a multiattribute procurement auction that builds on this idea 
 gai in multiattribute auctions 
 the multiattribute procurement problem 
in the procurement setting a single buyer wishes to procure a 
single good in some configuration θ ∈ θ from one of the 
candidate sellers s sn the buyer has some private valuation 
function wtp ub θ → r and similarly each seller si has a 
private valuation function willingness-to-accept for compliance 
with the procurement literature we refer to seller si s valuation as a 
cost function denoted by ci the multiattribute allocation problem 
 map is the welfare optimization problem in procurement 
over a discrete domain and it is defined as 
i 
 θ 
 arg max 
i θ 
 ub θ − ci θ 
to illustrate the need for a gai price space we consider the case 
of traders with non-additive preferences bidding in an additive price 
space such as in pk s auction ad if the buyer s preferences are 
not additive choosing preferred levels per attribute as in auction 
ad admits undesired combinations and fails to guide the sellers to 
the efficient configurations non-additive sellers face an exposure 
problem somewhat analogous to traders with complementary 
preferences that participate in simultaneous auctions a value a 
for 
attribute a may be optimal given that the value of another attribute 
b is b 
 and arbitrarily suboptimal given other values of b 
therefore bidding a 
and b 
may result in a poor allocation if the seller 
is outbid on b 
but left holding a 
 
instead of assuming full additivity the auction designer can come 
up with a gai preference structure that captures the set of common 
interdependencies between attributes if traders could bid on 
clusters of interdependent attributes it would solve the problems 
discussed above for example if a and b are interdependent meaning 
cdi a b does not hold we should be able to bid on the cluster 
ab if b in turn depends on c we need another cluster bc this 
is still better than a general pricing structure that solicits bids for 
the cluster abc we stress that each trader may have a different set 
of interdependencies and therefore to be completely general the 
 
if only the sellers are non-additive the auction design could 
potentially alleviate this problem by collecting a new set of bids each 
round and forgetting bids from previous rounds and also guiding 
non-additive sellers to bid on only one level per attribute in order 
to avoid undesired combinations

gai structure needs to account for all 
however in practice many 
domains have natural dependencies that are mutual to traders 
 gai trees 
assume that preferences of all traders are reflected in a gai 
structure i ig we call each ir a gai element and any 
assignment to ir a sub-configuration we use θr to denote the 
subconfiguration formed by projecting configuration θ to element ir 
definition let α be an assignment to ir and β an 
assignment to ir the sub-configurations α and β are consistent if for 
any attribute aj ∈ ir ∩ ir α and β agree on the value of aj a 
collection ν of sub-configurations is consistent if all pairs α β ∈ ν 
are consistent the collection is called a cover if it contains 
exactly one sub-configuration αr corresponding to each element ir 
r ∈ g 
note that a consistent cover α αg represents a full 
configuration which we denote by α αg 
a gai network is a graph g whose nodes correspond to the gai 
elements i ig with an edge between ir ir iff ir ∩ ir ∅ 
equivalently a gai network is the clique graph of a cdi-map 
in order to justify the compact pricing structure we require that 
for any set of optimal configurations wrt a given utility function 
with a corresponding collection of sub-configurations γ all 
consistent covers in γ must be optimal configurations as well to ensure 
this see lemmas and we assume a gai decomposition in 
the form of a tree or a forest the gai tree a tree structure can 
be achieved for any set of cdi conditions by triangulation of the 
cdi-map prior to construction of the clique graph gai networks 
and gai trees are defined by gonzales and perny who also 
provide a triangulation algorithm under gai the buyer s value 
function ub and sellers cost functions ci can be decomposed as in 
 we use fb r and fi r to denote the local functions of buyer and 
sellers respectively according to 
for example consider the procurement of a good with three 
attributes a b c each attribute s domain has two values e g 
 a 
 a 
 is the domain of a let the gai structure be i

 the gai auction 
we define an iterative multiattribute auction that maintains a gai 
pricing structure that is a price pt 
 · corresponding to each 
subconfiguration of each gai-tree element the price of a 
configuration θ at time t is defined as 
pt 
 θ 
g

r 
pt 
 θr − δ 
 
we relax this requirement in section 
 
bidders submit sub-bids on sub-configurations and on an 
additional global discount term δ 
sub-bids are always submitted for 
current prices and need to be resubmitted at each round therefore 
they do not need to explicitly carry the price the set of full bids 
of a seller contains all consistent covers that can be generated from 
that seller s current set of sub-bids the existence of a full bid over 
a configuration θ represents the seller s willingness to accept the 
price pt 
 θ for supplying θ 
at the start of the auction the buyer reports to the auction not 
to sellers her complete valuation in gai form the initial prices 
of sub-configurations are set at some level above the buyer s 
valuations that is p 
 θr fb r θr for all θr the discount δ is 
initialized to zero the auction has the dynamics of a descending 
clock auction at each round t bids are collected for current prices 
and then prices are reduced according to price rules a seller is 
considered active in a round if she submits at least one full bid in 
round t only sellers who where active in round t − are 
allowed to participate and the auction terminates when no more than 
a single seller is active we denote the set of sub-bids submitted by 
si by bt 
i and the corresponding set of full bids is 
bt 
i θ θ θg ∈ θ ∀r θr ∈ bt 
i 
in our example a seller could submit sub-bids on a set of 
subconfigurations such as a 
b

bid on a 
b 
c 
 
the auction proceeds in two phases in the first phase a at 
each round t the auction computes a set of preferred 
sub-configurations mt

to ensure 
convergence and section shows how to efficiently compute it 
in phase a the auction adjusts prices after each round reducing

is to δ which is increased in every round by the auction

the overall auction is described by high-level pseudocode in

to guide the traders to their efficient configurations phase b is a

 economic analysis 
when the optimal solution to map provides negative 
welfare and sellers do not bid below their cost the auction 
terminates in phase a no trade occurs and the auction is trivially 
efficient we therefore assume throughout the analysis that the optimal 
 seller configuration pair provides non-negative welfare 
the buyer profit from a configuration θ is defined as 
πb θ ub θ − p θ 
and similarly πi θ p θ − ci θ is the profit of si in 
addition for μ ⊆ g we denote the corresponding set of 
subconfigurations by θμ and define the profit from a configuration θ 
over the subset μ as 
πb θμ 
x 
r∈μ 
 fb r θr − p θr 
πi θμ is defined similarly for si crucially for any μ and its 
complement ¯μ and for any trader τ 
πτ θ πτ θμ πτ θ¯μ 
the function σi θ → r represents the welfare or surplus 
function ub · − ci · for any price system p 
σi θ πb θ πi θ 
 
we drop the t superscript in generic statements involving price 
and profit functions understanding that all usage is with respect to 
the currently applicable prices 
 
since we do not assume anything about the buyer s strategy the 
analysis refers to profit and surplus with respect to the face value 
of the buyer s report the functions πi and σi refer to the true cost 
functions of si 
definition a seller is called straightforward bidder sb 
if at each round t she bids on bt 
i as follows if maxθ∈θ πt 
i θ 
then bt 
i ∅ otherwise let 
ωt 
i ⊆ arg max 
θ∈θ 
πt 
i θ 
bt 
i θr θ ∈ ωt 
i r ∈ g 
intuitively an sb seller follows a myopic best response strategy 
 mbr meaning they bid myopically rather than strategically by 
optimizing their profit with respect to current prices to 
calculate bt 
i sellers need to optimize their current profit function as 
discussed in section 
the following lemma bridges the apparent gap between the 
compact pricing and bid structure and the global optimization performed 
by the traders 
lemma let ψ be a set of configurations all maximizing 
profit for a trader τ seller or buyer at the relevant prices let 
φ θr θ ∈ ψ r ∈ g then any consistent cover in φ 
is also a profit-maximizing configuration for τ 
proof sketch full proof in the online appendix a source of an 
element θr is a configuration ˜θ ∈ ψ from which it originated 
 meaning ˜θr θr starting from the supposedly suboptimal cover θ 
 
we build a series of covers θ 
 θl 
 at each θj 
we flip the value 
of a set of sub-configurations μj corresponding to a subtree with 
the sub-configurations of the configuration ˆθj 
∈ ψ which is the 
source of the parent γj of μj that ensures that all elements in 
μj ∪ γj have a mutual source ˆθj 
 we show that all θj 
are 
consistent and that they must all be suboptimal as well and since all 
elements of θl 
have a mutual source meaning θl 
 ˆθl 
∈ ψ it 
contradicts optimality of ψ 
corollary for sb seller si 
∀t ∀θ ∈ bt

next we consider combinations of configurations that are only 
within some δ of optimality 
lemma let ψ be a set of configurations all are within δ 
of maximizing profit for a trader τ at the prices and φ defined 
as in lemma then any consistent cover in φ is within δg of 
maximizing utility for τ 
this bound is tight that is for any gai tree and a non-trivial 
domain we can construct a set ψ as above in which there exists a 
consistent cover whose utility is exactly δg below the maximal 
next we formally define mt 
 for connected gai trees mt 
is 
the set of sub-configurations that are part of a configuration within 
of optimal when the gai tree is in fact a forest we apportion 
the error proportionally across the disconnected trees let g be 
comprised of trees g gh we use θj to denote the projection 
of a configuration θ on the tree gj and gj denotes the number of 
gai elements in gj 
mt 
j θr πt 
b θj ≥ max 
θj ∈θj 
πt 
b θj − gj 
g 
 r ∈ gj 
then define mt 
 
sh 
j mt 
j 
let ej gj − denote the number of edges in gj we define the 
connectivity parameter e maxj h ej as shown below this 
connectivity parameter is an important factor in the performance of 
the auction 
corollary 
∀θ ∈ mt

b θ ≥ max 
θ∈θ

b θ − e 
in the fully additive case this loss of efficiency reduces to on the 
other extreme if the gai network is connected then e g we 
also note that without assuming any preference structure meaning 
that the cdi map is fully connected g and the efficiency loss 
is again 
lemmas through show that through the price system the 
choice of buyer preferred configurations and price change rules 
phase a leads the buyer and each of the sellers to their mutually 
efficient configuration 
lemma maxθ∈θ πt 
b θ does not change in any round t of 
phase a 
proof we prove the lemma per each tree gj the optimal 
values for disconnected components are independent of each other 
hence if the maximal profit for each component does not change 
the combined maximal profit does not change as well if the price 
of θj was reduced during phase a that is pt 
 θj pt 
 θj − δ 
it must be the case that some w ≤ gj sub-configurations of θj are 
not in mt 
j and δ w 
g 
 the definition of mt 
j ensures 
πt 
b θj max

therefore 
πt 
b θ πt 
 θ δ πt 
 θ

≤ max 
θ∈θ 
πt 
b θj 
this is true for any configuration whose profit improves 
therefore the maximal buyer profit does not change during phase a 
lemma the price of at least one sub-configuration must 
be reduced at every round in phase a 
proof in each round t t of phase a there exists an active 
seller i for whom bt 
i ∩ mt 
 ∅ however to be active in round t 
bt 
i ∅ let ˆθ ∈ bt 
i if ∀r ˆθr ∈ mt 
 then ˆθ ∈ mt 
by definition 
of mt 
 therefore there must be ˆθr ∈ mt 
 we need to prove that 
for at least one of these sub-configurations πt 
b ˆθr to ensure 
activation of rule a 
assume for contradiction that for any ˆθr ∈ ¯mt 
 πt 
b ˆθr ≥ 
for simplicity we assume that for any θr π 
b θr is some product 
of g 
 that can be easily done and that ensures that πt 
b ˆθr 
because once profit hits it cannot increase by rule a 
if ˆθr ∈ ¯mt 
 ∀r g then πt 
b ˆθ this contradicts 
lemma since we set high initial prices therefore some of the 
sub-configurations of ˆθ are in mt 
 and wlog we assume it is 
ˆθ ˆθk to be in mt 
these k sub-configurations must have been 
in some preferred full configuration meaning there exists θ ∈ mt 
such that 
θ ˆθ ˆθk θk θg 
since ˆθ ∈ mt 
it must be that case that πt 
b ˆθ πt 
b θ therefore 
πt 
b θk θg πt 
b ˆθk ˆθg 
hence for at least one r ∈ k g πt 
b θr 
contradicting rule a 
 
lemma when the solution to map provides positive 
surplus and at least the best seller is sb the auction must reach 
phase b 
proof by lemma prices must go down in every round 
of phase a rule a sets a lower bound on all prices therefore 
the auction either terminates in phase a or must reach condition 
 switch 
we set the initial prices are high such that maxθ∈θ π 
b θ 
and by lemma maxθ∈θ πt 
b θ during phase a we 
assume that the efficient allocation θ 
 i 
 provides positive welfare 
that is σi θ 
 πt 
b θ 
 πt 
i θ 
 si is sb therefore 
she will leave the auction only when πt 
i θ 
 this can 
happen only when πt 
b θ 
 therefore si does not drop in 
phase a hence the auction cannot terminate before reaching 
condition switch 
lemma for sb seller si ηi is e -efficient 
proof ηi is chosen to maximize the buyer s surplus out of bt 
i 
at the end of phase a since bt 
i ∩ mt 
 ∅ clearly ηi ∈ mt 
 from 
corollary and corollary for any ˜θ 
πt 
b ηi ≥ πt 
b ˜θ − e 
πt 
i ηi ≥ πt 
i ˜θ 
⇒ σi ηi ≥ σi ˜θ − e 
this establishes the approximate bilateral efficiency of the results 
of phase a at this point under the assumption of sb based on 
phase b s simple role as a single-dimensional bidding competition 
over the discount we next assert that the overall result is efficient 
under sb which in turn proves to be an approximately ex-post 
equilibrium strategy in the two phases 
lemma if sellers si and sj are sb and si is active at least 
as long as sj is active in phase b then 
σi ηi ≥ max 
θ∈θ 
σj θ − e 
 
theorem given a truthful buyer and sb sellers the 
auction is e -efficient the surplus of the final allocation is within 
 e of the maximal surplus 
following pk we rely on an equivalence to the one-sided vcg 
auction to establish incentive properties for the sellers in the 
onesided multiattribute vcg auction buyer and sellers report 
valuation and cost functions ˆub ˆci and the buyer pays the sell-side vcg 
payment to the winning seller 
definition let θ 
 i 
 be the optimal solution to map 
let ˜θ ˜i be the best solution to map when i 
does not participate 
the sell-side vcg payment is 
v cg ˆub ˆci ˆub θ 
 − ˆub ˜θ − ˆc˜i ˜θ 
it is well-known that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for 
sellers in the one-sided vcg auction it is also shown by pk that 
the maximal regret for buyers from bidding truthfully in this 
mechanism is ub θ 
 − ci θ 
 − ub ˜θ − ˆc˜i ˜θ that is the marginal 
product of the efficient seller 
usually in iterative auctions the vcg outcome is only nearly 
achieved but the deviation is bounded by the minimal price change 
we show a similar result and therefore define δ-vcg payments 
definition sell-side δ-vcg payment for map is a 
payment p such that 
v cg ˆub ˆci − δ ≤ p ≤ v cg ˆub ˆci δ 
when payment is guaranteed to be δ-vcg sellers can only affect 
their payment within that range therefore their gain by falsely 
reporting their cost is bounded by δ 
lemma when sellers are sb the payment in the end of 
gai auction is sell-side e -vcg 
theorem sb is an e ex-post nash equilibrium 
for sellers in gai auction that is sellers cannot gain more than 
 e by deviating 
in practice however sellers are unlikely to have the information 
that would let them exploit that potential gain they are much more 
likely to lose from bidding on their less attractive configurations 
 computation and complexity 
the size of the price space maintained in the auction is equal to 
the total number of sub-configurations meaning it is exponential in 
maxr ir this is also equivalent to the tree-width plus one of the 
original cdi-map for the purpose of the computational analysis 
let dj denote the domain of attribute aj and i 
sg 
r 
q 
j∈ir 
dj 
the collection of all sub-configurations the first purpose of this 
sub-section is to show that the complexity of all the computations 
required for the auction depends only on i i e no computation 
depends on the size of the full exponential domain 
we are first concerned with the computation of mt 
 since mt 
grows monotonically with t a naive application of optimization 
algorithm to generate the best outcomes sequentially might end up 
enumerating significant portions of the fully exponential domain 
however as shown below this plain enumeration can be avoided 
proposition the computation of mt 
can be done in time 
o i 
 moreover the total time spent on this task throughout the 
auction is o i i t 
the bounds are in practice significantly lower based on results on 
similar problems from the probabilistic reasoning literature 
one of the benefits of the compact pricing structure is the 
compact representation it lends for bids sellers submit only sub-bids 
and therefore the number of them submitted and stored per seller 
is bounded by i since the computation tasks bt 
i ∅ rule 
 switch and choice of ηi are all involving the set bt 
i it is 
important to note that their performance only depend on the size of 
the set bt 
i since they are all subsumed by the combinatorial 
optimization task over bt 
i or bt 
i ∩ mt 
 
next we analyze the number of rounds it takes for the auction 
to terminate phase b requires maxi n πt 
i ηi 
 since this is 
equivalent to price-only auctions the concern is only with the time 
complexity of phase a since prices cannot go below fb r θr an 
upper bound on the number of rounds required is 
t ≤ 
x 
θr∈i 
 p 
 θr − fb r θr 
g 
however phase a may converge faster let the initial negative 
profit chosen by the auctioneer be m maxθ∈θ π 
b θ in the 
worst case phase a needs to run until ∀θ ∈ θ πb θ m this 
happens for example when ∀θr ∈ i pt 
 θr fb r θr m

 in 
general the closer the initial prices reflect buyer valuation the 
faster phase a converges one extreme is to choose p

 that would make phase a redundant at the cost of 
full initial revelation of buyer s valuation as done in other 
mechanisms discussed below between this option and the other extreme 
which is ∀α ˆα ∈ i p 
 α p 
 ˆα the auctioneer has a range of 
choices to determine the right tradeoff between convergence time 
and information revelation in the example below the choice of a 
lower initial price for the domain of i provides some speedup by 
revealing a harmless amount of information 
another potential concern is the communication cost associated 
with the japanese auction style the sellers need to send their bids 
over and over again at each round a simple change can be made 
to avoid much of the redundant communication the auction can 
retain sub-bids from previous rounds on sub-configurations whose 
price did not change since combinations of sub-bids from different 
rounds can yield sub-optimal configurations each sub-bid should 
be tagged with the number of the latest round in which it was 
submitted and only consistent combinations from the same round are 
considered to be full bids with this implementation sellers need 
not resubmit their bid until a price of at least one sub-configuration 
has changed 
 example 
we use the example settings introduced in section recall 
that the gai structure is i a b i b c note that e 
table shows the gai utilities for the buyer and the two sellers 
s s the efficient allocation is s a

 with a surplus of 
the maximal surplus of the second best seller s is achieved 
by a 
b 
c 
 a 
b 
c 
 and a 
b 
c 
 we set all initial prices over i 
to and all initial prices over i to we set meaning 
that price reduction for sub-configurations is though with these 
numbers it is not guaranteed by theorem we expect s to win on 
either the efficient allocation or on a 
b 
c 
which provides a surplus 
of the reason is that these are the only two configurations 
which are within e of being efficient for s therefore 
one of them must be chosen by phase a and both provide more 
than surplus over s s most efficient configuration and this is 
sufficient in order to win in phase b 
table shows the progress of phase a initially all configuration 
have the same cost so sellers bid on their lowest cost 
configuration which is a 
b 
c 
for both with profit to s and to s 
and that translates to sub-bids on a 
b 
and b 
c 
 m 
contains the 
sub-configurations a

a

 price is therefore decreased on a

c 
 after the

bids on a

 now round their prices go down

 discussion 
 preferential assumptions 
a key aspect in implementing gai based auctions is the choice 
of the preference structure that is the elements i ig in 
some domains the structure can be more or less robust over time 
and over different decision makers when this is not the case 
extracting reliable structure from sellers in the form of cdi 
conditions is a serious challenge this could have been a deal breaker 
for such domains but in fact it can be overcome it turns out that 
we can run this auction without any assumptions on sellers 
preference structure the only place where this assumption is used in our 
analysis is for lemma if sellers whose preference structure does 
not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit 
only one full bid at each round or a set of bids that does not yield 
undesired consistent combinations all the properties of the auction 
 
still hold locally the sellers can optimize their profit functions 
using the union of their gai structure with the auction s structure 
it is therefore essential only that the buyer s preference structure is 
accurately modeled of course capturing sellers structures as well 
is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers 
take advantage of the compact bid representation 
in both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the 
complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction 
it is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in 
order to reduce dimensionality the complexity of the structure 
also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e 
 information revelation properties 
in considering information properties of this mechanism we 
compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions 
which is based on the theoretical foundations of che in most of 
these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the 
mechanism solicits bids from the sellers the 
mechanisms suggested by beil and wein is different since buyers 
can modify their scoring function each round but the goal there is 
to maximize the buyer s profit whereas these iterative 
procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information 
revelation from the sellers a major drawback is that the buyer s 
utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any 
commitment in the mechanisms suggested by pk and in our gai 
auction above buyer information is revealed only in exchange for 
sell commitments in particular sellers learn nothing beyond the 
initial price upper bound which can be arbitrarily loose about the 
utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted when 
bids are submitted for a configuration θ sellers would be able to 
infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only 
after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred 
configuration as well 
 conclusions 
we propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in 
multiattribute auctions rather than assuming full additivity or no 
structure at all we model preferences using the gai decomposition 
we developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on 
the decomposition and also provided direct means of constructing 
the representation from relatively simple statements of 
willingnessto-pay our auction mechanism generalizes pk s preference 
modeling while in essence retaining their information revelation 
properties it allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of 
preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure 
and efficiency of the auction as well as tradeoffs between buyer s 
information revelation and the time required for convergence
