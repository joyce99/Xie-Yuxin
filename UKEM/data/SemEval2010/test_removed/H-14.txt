abstract 
we present a novel web search interaction feature which for a 
given query provides links to websites frequently visited by other 
users with similar information needs these popular destinations 
complement traditional search results allowing direct navigation to 
authoritative resources for the query topic destinations are 
identified using the history of search and browsing behavior of 
many users over an extended time period whose collective behavior 
provides a basis for computing source authority we describe a user 
study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the 
previously proposed suggestion of related queries as well as with 
traditional unaided web search results show that search enhanced 
by destination suggestions outperforms other systems for 
exploratory tasks with best performance obtained from mining past 
user behavior at query-level granularity

 introduction 
the problem of improving queries sent to information retrieval 
 ir systems has been studied extensively in ir research 
alternative query formulations known as query suggestions can be 
offered to users following an initial query allowing them to modify 
the specification of their needs provided to the system leading to 
improved retrieval performance recent popularity of web search 
engines has enabled query suggestions that draw upon the query 
reformulation behavior of many users to make query 
recommendations based on previous user interactions 
leveraging the decision-making processes of many users for query 
reformulation has its roots in adaptive indexing in recent years 
applying such techniques has become possible at a much larger 
scale and in a different context than what was proposed in early 
work however interaction-based approaches to query suggestion 
may be less potent when the information need is exploratory since 
a large proportion of user activity for such information needs may 
occur beyond search engine interactions in cases where directed 
searching is only a fraction of users information-seeking behavior 
the utility of other users clicks over the space of top-ranked results 
may be limited as it does not cover the subsequent browsing 
behavior at the same time user navigation that follows search 
engine interactions provides implicit endorsement of web resources 
preferred by users which may be particularly valuable for 
exploratory search tasks thus we propose exploiting a 
combination of past searching and browsing user behavior to 
enhance users web search interactions 
browser plugins and proxy server logs provide access to the 
browsing patterns of users that transcend search engine interactions 
in previous work such data have been used to improve search result 
ranking by agichtein et al however this approach only 
considers page visitation statistics independently of each other not 
taking into account the pages relative positions on post-query 
browsing paths radlinski and joachims have utilized such 
collective user intelligence to improve retrieval accuracy by using 
sequences of consecutive query reformulations yet their approach 
does not consider users interactions beyond the search result page 
in this paper we present a user study of a technique that exploits the 
searching and browsing behavior of many users to suggest popular 
web pages referred to as destinations henceforth in addition to the 
regular search results the destinations may not be among the 
topranked results may not contain the queried terms or may not even 
be indexed by the search engine instead they are pages at which 
other users end up frequently after submitting same or similar 
queries and then browsing away from initially clicked search 
results we conjecture that destinations popular across a large 
number of users can capture the collective user experience for 
information needs and our results support this hypothesis 
in prior work o day and jeffries identified teleportation as 
an information-seeking strategy employed by users jumping to their 
previously-visited information targets while anderson et al 
applied similar principles to support the rapid navigation of web 
sites on mobile devices in wexelblat and maes describe a 
system to support within-domain navigation based on the browse 
trails of other users however we are not aware of such principles 
being applied to web search research in the area of recommender 
systems has also addressed similar issues but in areas such as 
question-answering and relatively small online communities 
 perhaps the nearest instantiation of teleportation is search 
engines offering of several within-domain shortcuts below the title 
of a search result while these may be based on user behavior and 
possibly site structure the user saves at most one click from this 
feature in contrast our proposed approach can transport users to 
locations many clicks beyond the search result saving time and 
giving them a broader perspective on the available related 
information 
the conducted user study investigates the effectiveness of including 
links to popular destinations as an additional interface feature on 
search engine result pages we compare two variants of this 
approach against the suggestion of related queries and unaided web 
search and seek answers to questions on i user preference and 
search effectiveness for known-item and exploratory search tasks 
and ii the preferred distance between query and destination used to 
identify popular destinations from past behavior logs the results 
indicate that suggesting popular destinations to users attempting 
exploratory tasks provides best results in key aspects of the 
information-seeking experience while providing query refinement 
suggestions is most desirable for known-item tasks 
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section we 
describe the extraction of search and browsing trails from user 
activity logs and their use in identifying top destinations for new 
queries section describes the design of the user study while 
sections and present the study findings and their discussion 
respectively we conclude in section with a summary 
 search trails and destinations 
we used web activity logs containing searching and browsing 
activity collected with permission from hundreds of thousands of 
users over a five-month period between december and april 
 each log entry included an anonymous user identifier a 
timestamp a unique browser window identifier and the url of a 
visited web page this information was sufficient to reconstruct 
temporally ordered sequences of viewed pages that we refer to as 
trails in this section we summarize the extraction of trails their 
features and destinations trail end-points in-depth description 
and analysis of trail extraction are presented in 
 trail extraction 
for each user interaction logs were grouped based on browser 
identifier information within each browser instance participant 
navigation was summarized as a path known as a browser trail 
from the first to the last web page visited in that browser located 
within some of these trails were search trails that originated with a 
query submission to a commercial search engine such as google 
yahoo windows live search and ask it is these search trails 
that we use to identify popular destinations 
after originating with a query submission to a search engine trails 
proceed until a point of termination where it is assumed that the 
user has completed their information-seeking activity trails must 
contain pages that are either search result pages search engine 
homepages or pages connected to a search result page via a 
sequence of clicked hyperlinks extracting search trails using this 
methodology also goes some way toward handling multi-tasking 
where users run multiple searches concurrently since users may 
open a new browser window or tab for each task each task 
has its own browser trail and a corresponding distinct search trail 
to reduce the amount of noise from pages unrelated to the active 
search task that may pollute our data search trails are terminated 
when one of the following events occurs a user returns to their 
homepage checks e-mail logs in to an online service e g 
myspace or del ico us types a url or visits a bookmarked page 
 a page is viewed for more than minutes with no activity 
the user closes the active browser window if a page at step i 
meets any of these criteria the trail is assumed to terminate on the 
previous page i e step i - 
there are two types of search trails we consider session trails and 
query trails session trails transcend multiple queries and terminate 
only when one of the three termination criteria above are satisfied 
query trails use the same termination criteria as session trails but 
also terminate upon submission of a new query to a search engine 
approximately million query trails and million session trails 
were extracted from the logs we now describe some trail features 
 trail and destination analysis 
table presents summary statistics for the query and session trails 
differences in user interaction between the last domain on the trail 
 domain n and all domains visited earlier domains to n - 
are particularly important because they highlight the wealth of user 
behavior data not captured by logs of search engine interactions 
statistics are averages for all trails with two or more steps i e 
those trails where at least one search result was clicked 
table summary statistics mean averages for search trails 
measure query trails session trails 
number of unique domains 
total page 
views 
all domains 
domains to n - 
domain n destination 
total time

the statistics suggest that users generally browse far from the 
search results page i e around steps and visit a range of 
domains during the course of their search on average users visit 
unique non search-engine domains per query trail and just over 
unique domains per session trail this suggests that users often do 
not find all the information they seek on the first domain they visit 
for query trails users also visit more pages and spend significantly 
longer on the last domain in the trail compared to all previous 
domains combined 
these distinctions of the last domains in the 
trails may indicate user interest page utility or page relevance 
 destination prediction 
for frequent queries most popular destinations identified from web 
activity logs could be simply stored for future lookup at search time 
however we have found that over the six-month period covered by 
our dataset of queries are unique and queries occur 
or fewer times accounting for and of all searches 
respectively these numbers are comparable to those reported in 
previous studies of search engine query logs therefore a 
lookup-based approach would prevent us from reliably suggesting 
destinations for a large fraction of searches to overcome this 
problem we utilize a simple term-based prediction model 
as discussed above we extract two types of destinations query 
destinations and session destinations for both destination types 
we obtain a corpus of query-destination pairs and use it to construct 
term-vector representation of destinations that is analogous to the 
classic tf idf document representation in traditional ir 
then given a new query q consisting of k terms t  tk we identify 
highest-scoring destinations using the following similarity function 
 
independent measures t-test t   m p 
 
the topical relevance of the destinations was tested for a subset of around 
ten thousand queries for which we had human judgments the average 
rating of most of the destinations lay between good and excellent 
visual inspection of those that did not lie in this range revealed that many 
were either relevant but had no judgments or were related but had indirect 
query association e g petfooddirect com for query dogs 
 
 
where query and destination term weights an 
computed using standard tf idf weighting and que 
session-normalized smoothed tf idf weighting respec 
exploring alternative algorithms for the destination p 
remains an interesting challenge for future work resu 
study described in subsequent sections demonstrate th 
approach provides robust effective results

to examine the usefulness of destinations we con 
study investigating the perceptions and performance 
on four web search systems two with destination sug

four systems were used in this study a baseline web 
with no explicit support for query refinement base 
system with a query suggestion method that recomme 
queries querysuggestion and two systems that aug

query trails querydestination or end-points of

to establish baseline performance against which othe 
be compared we developed a masked interface to a p 
engine without additional support in formulating q

and returned ten top-ranking documents retrieved by t

perceptions we removed all identifying information

querysuggestion provides suggestions about f

organization where they hold a range of positions in different 
divisions the average age of subjects was years max

 tasks 
since the search task may influence information-seeking behavior 
 we made task type an independent variable in the study we 
constructed six known-item tasks and six open-ended exploratory 
tasks that were rotated between systems and subjects as described in 
the next section figure shows examples of the two task types

figure examples of known-item and exploratory tasks 
exploratory tasks were phrased as simulated work task situations 
 i e short search scenarios that were designed to reflect real-life 
information needs these tasks generally required subjects to 
gather background information on a topic or gather sufficient 
information to make an informed decision the known-item search 
tasks required search for particular items of information e g 
activities discoveries names for which the target was 
welldefined a similar task classification has been used successfully in 
previous work tasks were taken and adapted from the text 
retrieval conference trec interactive track and questions 
posed on question-answering communities yahoo answers 
google answers and windows live qna to motivate the 
subjects during their searches we allowed them to select two 
known-item and two exploratory tasks at the beginning of the 
experiment from the six possibilities for each category before 
seeing any of the systems or having the study described to them 
prior to the experiment all tasks were pilot tested with a small 
number of different subjects to help ensure that they were 
comparable in difficulty and selectability i e the likelihood that 
a task would be chosen given the alternatives post-hoc analysis of 
the distribution of tasks selected by subjects during the full study 
showed no preference for any task in either category 
 design and methodology 
the study used a within-subjects experimental design system had 
four levels corresponding to the four experimental systems and 
search tasks had two levels corresponding to the two task types 
system and task-type order were counterbalanced according to a 
graeco-latin square design 
subjects were tested independently and each experimental session 
lasted for up to one hour we adhered to the following procedure 
 upon arrival subjects were asked to select two known-item and 
two exploratory tasks from the six tasks of each type 
 subjects were given an overview of the study in written form that 
was read aloud to them by the experimenter 
 subjects completed a demographic questionnaire focusing on 
aspects of search experience 
 for each of the four interface conditions 
a subjects were given an explanation of interface functionality 
lasting around minutes 
b subjects were instructed to attempt the task on the assigned 
system searching the web and were allotted up to minutes 
to do so 
c upon completion of the task subjects were asked to complete 
a post-search questionnaire 
 after completing the tasks on the four systems subjects answered 
a final questionnaire comparing their experiences on the systems 
 subjects were thanked and compensated 
in the next section we present the findings of this study 
 findings 
in this section we use the data derived from the experiment to 
address our hypotheses about query suggestions and destinations

in this analysis and the level of significance is set to 
unless otherwise stated all likert scales and semantic differentials 
used a -point scale where a rating closer to one signifies more 
agreement with the attitude statement 
 subject perceptions 
in this section we present findings on how subjects perceived the 
systems that they used responses to post-search per-system and 
final questionnaires are used as the basis for our analysis 
 search process 
to address the first research question wanted insight into subjects 
perceptions of the search experience on each of the four systems in 
the post-search questionnaires we asked subjects to complete four 
 -point semantic differentials indicating their responses to the 
attitude statement the search we asked you to perform was the 
paired stimuli offered as responses were relaxing stressful

querysuggestion and querydestination than the other systems for 
known-item tasks 
for exploratory tasks only searches conducted 
on querydestination were easier than on the other systems 
subjects indicated that exploratory tasks on the three non-baseline 
systems were more stressful i e less relaxing than the 
knownitem tasks 
as we will discuss in more detail in section 
subjects regarded the familiarity of baseline as a strength and may 
have struggled to attempt a more complex task while learning a new 
interface feature such as query or destination suggestions 
 interface support 
we solicited subjects opinions on the search support offered by 
querysuggestion querydestination and sessiondestination the 
following likert scales and semantic differentials were used 
 likert scale a using this system enhances my effectiveness in 
finding relevant information effectiveness 
 likert scale b the queries destinations suggested helped me 
get closer to my information goal closetogoal

suggested if i encountered a similar task in the future re-use

the system were relevant irrelevant useful useless

additional comments on querysuggestion conveyed that subjects 
saw it as a convenience to save them typing a reformulation rather 
than a way to dramatically influence the outcome of their search 
for exploratory searches users benefited more from being pointed 
to alternative information sources than from suggestions for 
iterative refinements of their queries our findings also show that 
our subjects felt that querydestination produced more relevant 
and useful suggestions for exploratory tasks than the other 
systems 
all other observed differences between the systems were 
not statistically significant 
the difference between performance 
of querydestination and sessiondestination is explained by the 
approach used to generate destinations described in section 
sessiondestination s recommendations came from the end of users 
session trails that often transcend multiple queries this increases 
the likelihood that topic shifts adversely affect their relevance 
 system ranking 
in the final questionnaire that followed completion of all tasks on 
all systems subjects were asked to rank the four systems in 
descending order based on their preferences table presents the 
mean average rank assigned to each of the systems

ranking 
these results indicate that subjects preferred querysuggestion and 
querydestination overall however none of the differences 
between systems ratings are significant 
one possible explanation 
for these systems being rated higher could be that although the 
popular destination systems performed well for exploratory 
searches while querysuggestion performed well for known-item 
searches an overall ranking merges these two performances this 
relative ranking reflects subjects overall perceptions but does not 
separate them for each task category over all tasks there appeared 
to be a slight preference for querydestination but as other results 
show the effect of task type on subjects perceptions is significant 
the final questionnaire also included open-ended questions that 
asked subjects to explain their system ranking and describe what 
they liked and disliked about each system

 summary 
the findings obtained from our study on subjects perceptions of 
the four systems indicate that subjects tend to prefer 
querydestination for the exploratory tasks and querysuggestion 
for the known-item searches suggestions to incrementally refine 
the current query may be preferred by searchers on known-item 
tasks when they may have just missed their information target 
however when the task is more demanding searchers appreciate 
suggestions that have the potential to dramatically influence the 
direction of a search or greatly improve topic coverage 
 search tasks 
to gain a better understanding of how subjects performed during 
the study we analyze data captured on their perceptions of task 
completeness and the time that it took them to complete each task 
 subject perceptions 
in the post-search questionnaire subjects were asked to indicate on 
a -point likert scale the extent to which they agreed with the 
following attitude statement i believe i have succeeded in my

to complete three -point semantic differentials indicating their

all 
subject responses demonstrate that users felt that their searches had 
been more successful using querydestination for exploratory tasks 
than with the other three systems i e there was a two-way 
interaction between these two variables 
in addition subjects 
perceived a significantly greater sense of completion with 
knownitem tasks than with exploratory tasks 
subjects also found 
known-item tasks to be more simple clear and familiar 
these responses confirm differences in the nature of the tasks we 
had envisaged when planning the study as illustrated by the 
examples in figure the known-item tasks required subjects to 
retrieve a finite set of answers e g find three interesting things to 
do during a weekend visit to kyoto japan in contrast the 
exploratory tasks were multi-faceted and required subjects to find 
out more about a topic or to find sufficient information to make a 
decision the end-point in such tasks was less well-defined and 
may have affected subjects perceptions of when they had 
completed the task given that there was no difference in the tasks 
attempted on each system theoretically the perception of the tasks 
simplicity clarity and familiarity should have been the same for all 
systems however we observe a clear interaction effect between 
the system and subjects perception of the actual tasks 
 task completion time 
in addition to asking subjects to indicate the extent to which they 
felt the task was completed we also monitored the time that it took 
them to indicate to the experimenter that they had finished the 
elapsed time from when the subject began issuing their first query 
until when they indicated that they were done was monitored using 
a stopwatch and recorded for later analysis a stopwatch rather 
than system logging was used for this since we wanted to record the 
time regardless of system interactions figure shows the average

as can be seen in the figure above the task completion times for the 
known-item tasks differ greatly between systems 
subjects 
attempting these tasks on querydestination and querysuggestion 
complete them in less time than subjects on baseline and 
sessiondestination 
as discussed in the previous section subjects 
were more familiar with the known-item tasks and felt they were 
simpler and clearer baseline may have taken longer than the other 
systems since users had no additional support and had to formulate 
their own queries subjects generally felt that the recommendations 
offered by sessiondestination were of low relevance and 
usefulness consequently the completion time increased slightly 
between these two systems perhaps as the subjects assessed the 
value of the proposed suggestions but reaped little benefit from 
them the task completion times for the exploratory tasks were 
approximately equal on all four systems 
 although the time on 
baseline was slightly higher since these tasks had no clearly 
defined termination criteria i e the subject decided when they had 
gathered sufficient information subjects generally spent longer 
searching and consulted a broader range of information sources 
than in the known-item tasks 
 summary 
analysis of subjects perception of the search tasks and aspects of 
task completion shows that the querysuggestion system made 
subjects feel more successful and the task more simple clear 
and familiar for the known-item tasks on the other hand 
querydestination was shown to lead to heightened perceptions of 
search success and task ease clarity and familiarity for the 
exploratory tasks task completion times on both systems were 
significantly lower than on the other systems for known-item tasks 
 subject interaction 
we now focus our analysis on the observed interactions between 
searchers and systems as well as eliciting feedback on each 
system from our subjects we also recorded several aspects of their 
interaction with each system in log files in this section we analyze 
three interaction aspects query iterations search-result clicks and 
subject engagement with the additional interface features offered by 
the three non-baseline systems 
 queries and result clicks 
searchers typically interact with search systems by submitting 
queries and clicking on search results although our system offers 
additional interface affordances we begin this section by analyzing 
querying and clickthrough behavior of our subjects to better 
understand how they conducted core search activities table 
shows the average number of query iterations and search results 
clicked for each system-task pair the average value in each cell is 
computed for subjects on each task type and system

discussed in the previous section subjects using this system felt 
more successful in their searches yet they exhibited less of the 
traditional query and result-click interactions required for search 
success on traditional search systems it may be the case that 
subjects queries on this system were more effective but it is more 
likely that they interacted less with the system through these means 
and elected to use the popular destinations instead overall 
subjects submitted most queries in querysuggestion which is not 
surprising as this system actively encourages searchers to iteratively 
re-submit refined queries subjects interacted similarly with 
baseline and sessiondestination systems perhaps due to the low 
quality of the popular destinations in the latter to investigate this 
and related issues we will next analyze usage of the suggestions on 
the three non-baseline systems 
 suggestion usage 
to determine whether subjects found additional features useful we 
measure the extent to which they were used when they were 
provided suggestion usage is defined as the proportion of 
submitted queries for which suggestions were offered and at least 
one suggestion was clicked table shows the average usage for 
each system and task category

usage 
results indicate that querysuggestion was used more for 
knownitem tasks than sessiondestination 
 and querydestination was 
used more than all other systems for the exploratory tasks 
for 
well-specified targets in known-item search subjects appeared to 
use query refinement most heavily in contrast when subjects were 
exploring they seemed to benefit most from the recommendation of 
additional information sources subjects selected almost twice as 
many destinations per query when using querydestination 
compared to sessiondestination 
as discussed earlier this may 
be explained by the lower perceived relevance and usefulness of 
destinations recommended by sessiondestination 
 summary 
analysis of log interaction data gathered during the study indicates 
that although subjects submitted fewer queries and clicked fewer 
search results on querydestination their engagement with 
suggestions was highest on this system particularly for exploratory 
search tasks the refined queries proposed by querysuggestion 
were used the most for the known-item tasks there appears to be a 
clear division between the systems querysuggestion was preferred 
for known-item tasks while querydestination provided most-used 
support for exploratory tasks 
 discussion and implications 
the promising findings of our study suggest that systems offering 
popular destinations lead to more successful and efficient searching 
compared to query suggestion and unaided web search 
subjects seemed to prefer querysuggestion for the known-item 
tasks where the information-seeking goal was well-defined if the 
initial query does not retrieve relevant information then subjects

appreciate support in deciding what refinements to make to the 
query from examination of the queries that subjects entered for the 
known-item searches across all systems they appeared to use the 
initial query as a starting point and add or subtract individual terms 
depending on search results the post-search questionnaire asked 
subjects to select from a list of proposed explanations or offer their 
own explanations as to why they used recommended query 
refinements for both known-item tasks and the exploratory tasks 
around of subjects indicated that they selected a query 
suggestion because they wanted to save time typing a query 
while less than of subjects did so because the suggestions 
represented new ideas thus subjects seemed to view 
querysuggestion as a time-saving convenience rather than a way to 
dramatically impact search effectiveness 
the two variants of recommending destinations that we considered 
querydestination and sessiondestination offered suggestions that 
differed in their temporal proximity to the current query the 
quality of the destinations appeared to affect subjects perceptions 
of them and their task performance as discussed earlier domains 
residing at the end of a complete search session as in 
sessiondestination are more likely to be unrelated to the current 
query and thus are less likely to constitute valuable suggestions 
destination systems in particular querydestination performed best 
for the exploratory search tasks where subjects may have benefited 
from exposure to additional information sources whose topical 
relevance to the search query is indirect as with querysuggestion 
subjects were asked to offer explanations for why they selected 
destinations over both task types they suggested that destinations 
were clicked because they grabbed their attention 
represented new ideas or users couldn t find what they 
were looking for the least popular responses were 
wanted to save time typing the address and the destination 
was popular 
the positive response to destination suggestions from the study 
subjects provides interesting directions for design refinements we 
were surprised to learn that subjects did not find the popularity bars 
useful or hardly used the within-site search functionality inviting 
re-design of these components subjects also remarked that they 
would like to see query-based summaries for each suggested 
destination to support more informed selection as well as 
categorization of destinations with capability of drill-down for each 
category since querysuggestion and querydestination perform 
well in distinct task scenarios integrating both in a single system is 
an interesting future direction we hope to deploy some of these 
ideas on web scale in future systems which will allow log-based 
evaluation across large user pools 
 conclusions 
we presented a novel approach for enhancing users web search 
interaction by providing links to websites frequently visited by past 
searchers with similar information needs a user study was 
conducted in which we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed 
technique compared with a query refinement system and unaided 
web search results of our study revealed that i systems 
suggesting query refinements were preferred for known-item tasks 
 ii systems offering popular destinations were preferred for 
exploratory search tasks and iii destinations should be mined 
from the end of query trails not session trails overall popular 
destination suggestions strategically influenced searches in a way 
not achievable by query suggestion approaches by offering a new 
way to resolve information problems and enhance the 
informationseeking experience for many web searchers
