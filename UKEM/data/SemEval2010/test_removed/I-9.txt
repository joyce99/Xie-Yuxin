abstract 
interactions between agents in an open system such as the 
internet require a significant degree of flexibility a crucial 
aspect of the development of such methods is the notion of 
commitments which provides a mechanism for 
coordinating interactive behaviors among agents in this paper we 
investigate an approach to model commitments with tight 
integration with protocol actions this means that there 
is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols 
actions to operations on commitments and an external 
mechanism to process and enforce commitments we show how 
agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions 
to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning 
system based on temporal linear logic which incorporates both 
temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning we also discuss 
the application of this framework to scenarios such as online 
commerce

 introduction and motivation 
recently software development has evolved toward the 
development of intelligent interconnected systems working 
in a distributed manner the agent paradigm has become 
well suited as a design metaphor to deal with complex 
systems comprising many components each having their own 
thread of control and purposes and involved in dynamic and 
complex interactions 
in multi-agent environments agents often need to interact 
with each other to fulfill their goals protocols are used to 
regulate interactions in traditional approaches to protocol 
specification like those using finite state machines or petri 
nets protocols are often predetermined legal sequences of 
interactive behaviors in frequently changing environments 
such as the internet such fixed sequences can quickly 
become outdated and are prone to failure therefore agents 
are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed 
and interactions among agents should not be constructed 
rigidly 
to achieve flexibility as characterized by yolum and singh 
in interaction protocols should ensure that agents have 
autonomy over their interactive behaviors and be free from 
any unnecessary constraints also agents should be allowed 
to adjust their interactive actions to take advantages of 
opportunities or handle exceptions that arise during 
interaction 
for example consider the scenario below for online sales 
a merchant mer has cricket bats available for sale with 
a unit price of dollars a customer cus has cus 
has a goal of obtaining from mer a cricket bat at some time 
there are two options for cus to pay if cus uses credit 
payment mer needs a bank ebank to check cus s credit if 
cus s credit is approved ebank will arrange the credit 
payment otherwise cus may then take the option to pay via 
paypal the interaction ends when goods are delivered and 
payment is arranged 
a flexible approach to this example should include several 
features firstly the payment method used by cus should 
be at cus s own choice and have the property that if cus s 
credit check results in a disapproval this exception should 
also be handled automatically by cus s switching to paypal 
secondly there should be no unnecessary constraint on the 
order in which actions are performed such as which of 
making payments and sending the cricket bat should come first 
thirdly choosing a sequence of interactive actions should be 
based on reasoning about the intrinsic meanings of 
protocol actions which are based on the notion of commitment 
i e which refers to a strong promise to other agent s to 
undertake some courses of action 
current approaches to achieve flexibilities 
using the notion of commitment make use of an abstract 
layer of commitments however in these approaches a 
mapping from protocol actions onto operations on commitments 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
as well as handling and enforcement mechanisms of 
commitments must be externally provided execution of protocol 
actions also requires concurrent execution of operations on 
related commitments as a result the overhead of 
processing the commitment layer makes specification and execution 
of protocols more complicated and error prone there is also 
a lack of a logic to naturally express aspects of resources 
internal and external choices as well as time of protocols 
rather than creating another layer of commitment outside 
protocol actions we try to achieve a modeling of 
commitments that is integrated with protocol actions both 
commitments and protocol actions can then be reasoned about 
in one consistent system in order to achieve that we specify 
protocols in a declarative manner i e what is to be achieved 
rather then how agents should interact a key to this is using 
logic temporal logic in particular is suitable for 
describing and reasoning about temporal constraints while linear 
logic is quite suitable for modeling resources we suggest 
using a combination of linear logic and temporal logic to 
construct a commitment based interaction framework which 
allows both temporal and resource-related reasoning for 
interaction protocols this provides a natural manipulation 
and reasoning mechanism as well as internal enforcement 
mechanisms for commitments based on proof search 
this paper is organized as follows section discusses the 
background material of linear logic temporal linear logic 
and commitments section introduces our modeling 
framework and specification of protocols section discusses how 
our framework can be used for an example of online sale 
interactions between a merchant a bank and a customer 
we then discuss the advantages and limitations of using our 
framework to model interaction protocols and achieve 
flexibility in section section presents our conclusions and 
items of further work 
 background 
in order to increase the agents autonomy over their 
interactive behaviors protocols should be specified in terms of 
what is to be achieved rather than how the agents should act 
in other words protocols should be specified in a declarative 
manner using logic is central to this specification process 
 linear logic 
logic has been used as formalism to model and reason 
about agent systems linear logic is well-known for 
modeling resources as well as updating processes it has been 
considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation 
and planning by means of proof search 
in real life resources are consumed and new resources are 
created in such logic as classical or temporal logic however 
a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome 
if we model resources like a as one dollar and b as a 
chocolate bar then a ⇒ b in classical logic is read as 
from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar this causes 
problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar b 
is true while retaining one dollar a remains true 
in order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues 
girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be 
used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or 
removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas 
as resources in linear logic a linear implication a b 
however allows a to be removed after deriving b which 
means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a 
chocolate bar 
classical conjunction and and disjunction or are recast 
over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining 
and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives 
a ⊗ multiplicative conjunction a means that one has two 
as at the same time which is different from a ∧ a a 
hence ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion a ℘ 
 multiplicative disjunction b means that if not a then b 
or vice versa but not both a and b 
the ability to specify choices via the additive connectives 
is a particularly useful feature of linear logic a additive 
conjunction b stands for one own choice either of a or 
b but not both a ⊕ additive disjunction b stands for 
the possibility of either a or b but we don t know which 
as remarked in and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear 
between internal choices one s own and external choices 
 others choice for instance to specify that the choice of 
places a or b for goods delivery is ours as the supplier we 
use a b or is the client s we use a ⊕ b 
in agent systems this duality between inner and outer 
choices is manifested by one agent having the power to 
choose between alternatives and the other having to react 
to whatever choice is made 
moreover during interaction the ability to match 
consumption and supply of resources among agents can 
simplify the specification of resource allocations linear logic is 
a natural mechanism to provide this ability in addition 
it is emphasized in that linear logic is used to model agent 
states as sets of consumable resources and particularly 
linear implication is used to model transitions among states 
and capabilities of agents 
 temporal linear logic 
while linear logic provides advantages to modeling and 
reasoning about resources it does not deal naturally with 
time constraints temporal logic on the other hand is a 
formal system which addresses the description and reasoning 
about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over 
time temporal logic can be used for specification and 
verification of concurrent and reactive programs 
temporal linear logic tll is the result of 
introducing temporal logic into linear logic and hence is 
resourceconscious as well as deals with time the temporal 
operators used are next anytime and sometime 
formulas with no temporal operators can be considered as 
being available only at present adding to a formula a 
i e a means that a can be used only at the next time 
and exactly once similarly a means that a can be used 
at any time and exactly once a means that a can be used 
once at some time 
though both and refer to a point in time the choice 
of which time is different regarding the choice is an 
internal choice as appropriate to one s own capability with 
 the choice is externally decided by others 
 commitment 
the concept of social commitment has been recognized 
as fundamental to agent interaction indeed social 
commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and 
states in particular persistence in commitments 
introduces into agents consideration a certain level of 
predictability of other agents actions which is important when agents 
deal with issues of inter-dependencies global constraints or 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
resources sharing 
commitment based approaches associate protocols actions 
with operations on commitments and protocol states with 
the set of effective commitments completing the 
protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment 
operations to bring the current state to final states where all 
commitments are resolved from then the corresponding legal 
sequences of interactive actions are determined hence the 
approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal 
computations 
commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form 
known as pre-commitments a pre-commitment here refers 
to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner 
agent is willing to commit like performing some actions 
or achieving a particular state agents can negotiate about 
pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others 
the others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the 
proposal or proposing another pre-commitment once a 
precommitment is agreed it then becomes a commitment and 
the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment 
phase in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments 
 modeling agent interactions 
protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are 
essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on 
participating agents we take an internal view of protocols 
i e from the view of participating agents by putting the 
specification of commitments locally at the respective agents 
according to their roles 
such an approach enables agents to manage their own 
protocol commitments indeed agents no longer accept and 
follow a given set of commitments but can reason about 
which commitments of theirs to offer and which 
commitments of others to take while considering the current needs 
and the environment protocols arise as commitments are 
then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof 
search during the interaction also ongoing changes in the 
environment are taken as input into the generation of 
protocols by agent reasoning this is the reverse of other 
approaches which try to make the specification flexible to 
accommodate changes in the environment hence it is a step 
closer to enabling emergent protocols which makes 
protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context 
in a nutshell services are what agents are capable of 
providing to other agents commitments can then be seen to 
arise from combinations of services i e an agent s 
capabilia unit of consumable resources is modeled as a 
proposition in linear logic numeric figures can be used to 
abbreviate a multiplicative conjunction of the same instances for 
example dollar dollar ⊗ dollar moreover such 
a 
is a shorthand for a 
in order to address the dynamic manipulation of resources 
we also include information about the location and 
ownership in the encoding of resources to address the relocation 
and changes in possession of resources during agent 
interaction that resource a is located at agent α and owned 
by agent β is expressed via a shorthand notation as a αβ 
which is treated as a logic proposition in our framework 
this notation can be later extended to a more complex logic 
construct to reason about changes in location and 
ownership 
in our running example a cricket bat cricket b being 
located at and owned by agent mer is denoted as cricket b m m 
after a successful sale to the agent customer cus the cricket 
bat will be relocated to and owned by agent cus the 
formula cricket b cc will replace the formula cricket b mm 
to reflect the changes 
our treatment of unlimited resources is to model it as a 
number σ of copies of the resource s formula such that the 
number σ is chosen to be extremely large relative to the 
context for instance to indicate that the merchant mer 
can issue an unlimited number of sale quotes at any time 
we use σ sale quote m m 
declaration of actions is also modeled in a similar manner 
as of resources 
the capabilities of agents refer to producing consuming 
relocating and changing ownership of resources capabilities 
are represented by describing the state before and after 
performing them the general representation form is γ δ in 
which γ describes the conditions before and δ describes the 
conditions after the linear implication in linear logic 
indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed 
into the conditions after moreover some capabilities can 
be applied at any number of times in the interaction context 
and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ 
to take an example we consider the capability of agent 
mer of selling a cricket bat for dollars the conditions 
before are dollars and a payment method from agent 
cus  cc ⊗ pay m c given these by applying thec 
capability mer will gain dollars  mm and 
com⊥ 
 so that cusm 
mit to providing a cricket bat cricket b m 
will get a cricket bat cricket b cc together the 
capability is encoded as  c ⊗ pay m c  mc c 
⊗ cricket b c 
m ⊗ 
ties hence our approach shifts specifying a set of protocol 
commitments to specifying sets of pre-commitments as 
capabilities for each agent commitments are then can be 
⊥ 
m 
cricket b m c 
 modeling commitmentsreasoned about and manipulated by the same logic 
mechanism as is used for the agents actions resources and goals 
which greatly simplifies the system 
our framework uses tll as a means of specifying 
interaction protocols we encode various concepts such as resource 
capability and commitment in tll the symmetry between 
a formula and its negation in tll is explored as a way to 
model resources and commitments we then discuss the 
central role of pre-commitments and how they are specified at 
each participating agent it then remains for agents to 
reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments 
we discuss the modeling of various types of commitments 
their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms 
due to duality in linear logic positive formulas can be 
regarded as formulas in supply and negative formulas can 
be regarded as formulas in demand hence we take an 
approach of modeling non-conditional or base commitments as 
negative formulas in particular by turning a formula into 
its negative form a base commitment to derive the resources 
or carry out the actions associated with the formula is 
created in the above example a commitment of agent mer to 
⊥ 
m 
 which are subsequently discharged provide a cricket bat cricket b mm is cricket b m 
a base commitment is fulfilled discharged whenever the 
 modeling resources and capabilities committing agent successfully brings about the respective 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
resources or carries out the actions as required by the 
commitment in tll modeling this means that the 
corresponding positive formula is derived resolution of 
commitments can then be naturally carried out by inference in 
tll for example cricket b m will fulfil the commit-m 
ment cricket b m⊥ 
and both formulas are automaticallym 
removed as cricket b mm ⊗ cricket b m⊥ 
 m 
⊥ 
under a further assumption that agents are expected to 
resolve all formulas in demand removing negative 
formulas this creates a driving pressure on agents to resolve base 
commitments this pressure then becomes a natural and 
internal enforcement mechanism for base commitments 
a commitment with conditions or conditional 
commitment can be modeled by connecting the conditions to base 
commitments via a linear implication a general form is 
γ δ where γ is the condition part and δ includes base 
commitments if the condition γ is derived by consuming 
γ the linear implication will ensure that δ results which 
means the base commitments in δ become effective if the 
conditions can not be achieved the linear implication can 
not be applied and hence commitment part in the 
conditional commitment is still inactive 
in our approach conditional commitments are specified 
in their potential form as pre-commitments of participating 
agents pre-commitments are negotiated among agents via 
proposals and upon being accepted will form conditional 
commitments among the engaged agents conditional 
commitments are interpreted as that the condition γ is required 
of the proposed agent and the commitment part δ is the 
responsibility of the owner proposing agent indeed such 
interpretation and the encoding of realize the notion of 
a conditional commitment that owner agent is willing to 
commit to deriving δ given the proposed agent satisfies the 
conditions γ 
conditional commitments pre-commitments and 
capabilities all have similar encodings however their differences lie 
in the phases of commitment that they are in capabilities 
are used internally by the owner agent and do not involve 
any commitment pre-commitments can be regarded as 
capabilities intended for forming conditional commitments 
upon being accepted pre-commitments will turn into 
conditional commitments and bring the two engaged agents into a 
commitment phase as an example consider that mer has a 
capability of selling cricket bats  cc ⊗pay m cc 
  m ⊗ cricket b m⊥ 
⊗ cricket b cc when merm m 
proposes its capability to cus the capability acts as a 
precommitment when the proposal gets accepted that 
precommitment will turn into a conditional commitment in 
which mer commits to fulfilling the base commitment 
cricket b m⊥ 
 which leads to having cricket b cc uponm 
the condition that cus derives  cc ⊗pay m c whichc 
leads to having  mm 
breakable commitments which are in place to provide agents 
with the desired flexibility to remove itself from its 
commitments cancel commitments are also modeled naturally in 
our framework a base commitment com⊥ 
is turned into 
a breakable base commitment cond ⊕ com ⊥ 
 the extra 
token cond reflects the agent s internal deliberation about 
when the commitment to derive com is broken once cond 
is produced due to the logic deduction cond ⊗ cond ⊕ 
com ⊥ 
⊥ the commitment cond ⊕ com ⊥ 
is removed 
and hence breaking the commitment of deriving com 
moreover a breakable conditional commitment is modeled as 
a b instead of a b when the condition a 
is provided the linear implication brings about b and 
it is now up to the owner agent s internal choice whether 
or b is resulted if the agent chooses which practically 
means nothing is derived then the conditional commitment 
is deliberately broken 
 protocol construction 
given the modeling of various interaction concepts like 
resource action capability and commitment we will discuss 
how protocols can be specified 
in our framework each agent is encoded with the 
resources actions capabilities pre-commitments any 
pending commitments that it has pre-commitments which stem 
from services the agents are capable of providing are 
designated to be fair exchanges in a pre-commitment all the 
requirements of the other party are put in the condition part 
and all the effects to be provided by the owner agent are put 
on the commitment part to make up a trade-off such a 
design allows agents to freely propose pre-commitments to any 
interested parties 
an example of pre-commitments is that of an agent 
merchant regarding a sale of a cricket bat  cc ⊗pay m c 
  mm ⊗ cricket b cc ⊗cricket b m⊥ 
m 
 the 
condition is the requirement that the customer agent provides 
 dollars which is assumed to be the price of a cricket 
bat via a payment method the exchange is the cricket bat 
for the customer cricket b cc and hence is fair to the 
merchant 
protocols are specified in terms of sets of pre-commitments 
at participating agents given some initial interaction 
commitments a protocol emerges as agents are reasoning about 
which pre-commitments to offer and accept in order to fulfill 
these commitments 
given a such a protocol specification we then discuss how 
interaction might take place an interaction can start with a 
request or a proposal when an agent can not achieve some 
commitments by itself it can make a request of them or 
propose a relevant pre-commitment to an appropriate agent to 
fulfill them the choice of which pre-commitments depends 
on if such pre-commitments can produce the formulas to 
fulfill the agent s pending commitments 
when an agent receives a request it searches for 
precommitments that can together produce the required 
formulas of the requests those pre-commitments found will 
be used as proposals to the requesting agents otherwise a 
failure notice will be returned 
when a proposal is received the recipient agent also 
performs a search with the inclusion of the proposal for a proof 
of those formulas that can resolve its commitments if the 
search result is positive the proposal is accepted and 
becomes a commitment the recipient then attempts to fulfill 
conditions of the commitments otherwise the proposal is 
refused and no commitment is formed 
throughout the interaction proof search has played a 
vital role in protocol construction proof search reveals 
that some commitments can not be resolved locally or some 
pre-commitments can be used to resolve pending 
commitments which prompts the agent to make a request or 
proposal respectively proof search also determines which 
precommitments are relevant to fulfillment of a request which 
helps agents to decide which pre-commitments to propose to 
answer the request moreover whether a received proposal 
c 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
is relevant to any pending commitments or not is also 
determined by a search for proof of these commitments with 
an inclusion of the proposal conditions of proposals can 
be resolved by proof search as it links them with the agents 
current resources and capabilities as well as any relevant 
precommitments therefore it can be seen that proof search 
performed by participating agents can link up their 
respective pre-commitments and turn them into commitments as 
appropriate which give rise to protocol formation we will 
demonstrate this via our running example in section 
 interactive messages 
agents interact by sending messages we address agent 
interaction in a simple model which contains messages of 
type requests proposals acceptance refusal and failure 
notice 
we denote source to destination prior to each message 
to indicate the source and destination of the message for 
example cust to mer denotes that the message is sent 
from agent cust to agent mer 
request messages start with the key word request 
request formula formulas in request messages 
are of commitments 
proposal messages are preceded with propose 
formulas are of capabilities for example α to β propose 
γ δ is a proposal from agent α to agent β 
there are messages that agents use to response to a 
proposal agents can indicate an acceptance accept or 
a refusal refuse to notice a failure in fulfilling a 
request or proposal agents reply with that request or proposal 
message appended with fail 
 generating interactions 
as we have seen temporal linear logic provides an elegant 
means for encoding the various concepts of agent 
interaction in a commitment based specification framework 
appropriate interaction is generated as agents negotiate their 
specified pre-commitments to fulfill their goals the 
association among pre-commitments at participating agents and 
the monitoring of commitments to ensure that all are 
discharged are performed by proof search in the next section 
we will demonstrate how specification and generation of 
interactions in our framework might work 
 example 
we return to the online sales scenario introduced in 
section 
 specifying protocol 
we design a set of pre-commitments and capabilities to 
implement the above scenario for simplicity we refer to 
them as rules 
rules at agent mer 
mer has available at any time cricket bats for sale and 
can issue sale quotes at any time 
 cricket b m ⊗ σ sale quote m m m 
rule mer commits to offering a cricket bat 
 cricket b m⊥ 
m 
 to cus cricket b cc if cus pays 
dollars  cc either via paypal or credit card the choice 
is at cus 
σ  c ⊗ paypal paid m ⊕ credit paid mm c m 
  m ⊗ cricket b c ⊗ cricket b m⊥ 
m c m 
 
rule if ebank carries out the credit payment to mer 
then the requirement of credit payment at mer is fulfilled 
σ credit paym m credit paid mm b 
rule if ebank informs mer of its disapproval of cus s 
credit then mer will also let cus know 
σ credit not appr m credit not appr cb b 
rules at agent ebank 
rule upon receiving a sale quote from mer at the 
next time point ebank commits to either informing mer 
that cus s credit is not approved credit not appr mb or 
arranging a credit payment to mer credit paym mb 
the decision is dependent on the credibility of cus and hence 
is external ⊕ to ebank and mer 
σ sale quote m credit not appr mb ⊕m 
credit paym mb 
rules at agent cus 
cus has an amount of dollars available at any time can 
be used for credit payment or cash payment  c 
cus has a commitment of obtaining a cricket bat at some 
time cricket b cc ⊥ 
 
rule cus will pay mer via paypal if there is an 
indication from ebank that cus s credit is not approved 
σ credit not appr c paypal paid mm b 
 description of the interaction 
cus requests from mer a cricket bat at some time mer 
replies with a proposal in which each cricket bat costs 
dollars cus needs to prepare dollars and payment can 
be made by credit or via paypal 
assuming that cus only pays via paypal if credit payment 
fails cus will let mer charges by credit mer will then ask 
ebank to arrange a credit payment ebank proposes that 
mer gives a quote of sale and depending on cus s 
credibility at the next time point either credit payment will be 
arranged or a disapproval of cus s credit will be informed 
mer accepts and fulfills the conditions if the first case 
happens credit payment is done if the second case happens 
credit payment is failed cus may back track to take the 
option paying via paypal 
once payment is arranged mer will apply its original 
proposal to satisfy the cus s request of a cricket bat and hence 
removing one cricket bat and adding dollars into its set 
of resources 
 interaction 
 cus can not fulfill its commitment of cricket b cc ⊥ 
and hence makes a request to merchant 
c to m request cricket b cc ⊥ 
 to meet the request mer searches for applicable rules 
one applications of rule can derive cricket b c and 
cricket b c cricket b c mer will propose rule c c 
at a time instance n to cus as a pre-commitment 
m to c propose 
n 
  c ⊗ paypal paid m ⊕ credit paid mm c m 
  m ⊗ cricket b c ⊗ cricket b m⊥ 
m 
 m c 
with similar analysis cus determines that given the 
conc 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
ditions can be satisfied the proposals can help to derive its 
request hence 
c to m accept 
cus analyzes the conditions of the accepted proposal by 
proof search 
n  cc 
n paypal paid m or n credit paid mm - -m 
n  c ⊗ n paypal paid m ⊕ n credit paid mm c m 
n  c ⊗ paypal paid m ⊕ credit paid mm c m 
from one way to satisfy the conditions is for cus to 
derive at the next n time points dollars n 
  cc 
and to choose paying via paypal n 
paypal paid mm 
or by credit payment n 
credit paid mm 
 deriving n 
  c as cus has dollars it canc 
make use of dollars  c  c n 
  c c c c 
there are two options for payment method the 
choice is at agent cus we assume that cus prefers 
credit payment 
 deriving n 
credit paid m cus can not derivem 
this formula by itself hence it will make a request to mer 
c to m request n 
credit paid mm ⊥ 
 
 rule at mer is applicable but mer can not derive its 
condition n 
credit paym mb hence mer will further 
make a request to ebank 
m to e request n 
credit paym mb ⊥ 
ebank searches and finds rule applicable because 
credit paym m will be available one time point after theb 
rule s application time ebank proposes to mer an instance 
of rule at the next n - time points 
 b to m propose n − 
 quote mm 
credit not appr m ⊕ credit paym mb b 
with similar analysis mer accepts the proposal 
m to b accept 
the rule condition is fulfilled by mer as quote mm 
n − 
quote m hence ebank then applies the proposalm 
to derive 
n − 
 credit not appr m ⊕ credit paym mb b 
⊕ indicates the choice is external to both agents there are 
two cases cus s credit is approved or disapproved 
for simplicity we show only the case where cus s credit is 
approved at the next n - time point 
n − 
 credit not appr mb ⊕ credit paym mb 
becomes n − 
credit paym m n 
credit paym m b b 
as a result at the next n time points ebank will arrange 
the credit payment 
 mer fulfills cus s initial request 
when any of n 
paypal paid m if cus pays via pay-m 
pal or n 
credit paid m if cus pays by credit card m 
is derived n 
 credit paym m ⊕ paypal paid mm ism 
also derived hence the payment method is arranged 
together with the other condition  c being satisfied c 
this allows the initial proposal to be applied by mer to derive 
n 
cricket b cc and a commitment of n 
cricket b m⊥ 
m 
for mer which is also resolved by the resource cricket b mm 
available at mer 
any values of n such that n − ≥ ⇔ n ≥ will allow 
mer to fulfill cus s initial request of cricket b cc ⊥ 
 
the interaction ends as all commitments are resolved 
 flexibility 
the desired flexibility has been achieved in the example 
it is cus s own decision to proceed with the preferred 
payment method also non-determinism that whether cus s 
credit is disapproved or credit payment is made to mer is 
faithfully represented if an exception happens that cus s 
credit is not approved credit not appr c is produced andb 
cus can backtrack to paying via paypal rule will then 
be utilized to allow cus to handle the exception by paying 
via paypal 
moreover in order to specify that making payments and 
sending cricket bats can be in any order we can add in 
front of payment method in rule as follows 
σ  c ⊗ paypal paid m ⊕ credit paid mm c m 
  m ⊗ cricket b c ⊗ cricket b m⊥ 
m 
 m c 
this addition in the condition of the rule means that the 
time of payment can be any time up to cus s choice as 
long as cus pays and hence the time order between making 
payments and sending goods becomes flexible 
 encoding issues 
 advantages of tll framework 
our tll framework has demonstrated natural and 
expressive specification of agent interaction protocols linear 
implication expresses causal relationship which makes 
it natural to model a removal or a consumption especially 
of resources together with its consequences hence in our 
framework resource transformation is modeled as a linear 
implication of the consumed resources to the produced 
resources resource relocation is modeled as a linear 
implication from a resource at one agent to that resource at the 
other agent linear implication also ensures that fulfillment 
of the conditions of a conditional commitment will cause the 
commitments to happen moreover state updates of agents 
are resulted from a linear implication from the old state to 
the current state 
temporal operators and and their combinations 
help to specify the time of actions of resource availability 
and express the time order of events particularly precise 
time points are described by the use of operator or 
multiple copies of it based on this ability to specify correct 
time points for actions or events time order or sequencing 
of them can also be captured also a sense of duration is 
simulated by spreading copies of the resources or actions 
formulas across multiple adjacent time points moreover 
uncertainty in time can represented and reasoned about by 
the use of and and their combinations with can 
be used to express outer non-determinism while expresses 
inner non-determinism these time properties of resources 
actions and events are correctly respected through out the 
agent reasoning process based on sequent calculus rules 
furthermore the centrality of the notion of commitment 
in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks 
 however to the best of our knowledge 
modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of 
such a resource conscious and time aware logic as tll is 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
firstly investigated in our framework our framework 
models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional 
commitments via the use of linear implication and or 
negative formulas the modeling of commitments has a number 
of advantages 
 commitments are represented directly at the 
propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a 
non-logical construct like which makes treatment 
of commitments more natural and simple and allows to 
make use of readily available proof search systems like 
using sequent calculus for handling commitments 
existing logic connectives like ⊗ ⊕ are also readily 
available for describing the relationships among 
commitments 
 fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the 
corresponding positive formulas or condition 
formulas which then simply reduces to a proof search task 
also given the required formulas fulfillment of 
commitments can be implemented easily and 
automatically as deduction com ⊗ com⊥ 
⊥ 
the enforcement of commitments is also internal and 
simply implemented via the assumption that agents 
are driven to remove all negative formulas for base 
commitments and via the use of linear implication for 
conditional commitments 
regarding making protocol specification more flexible our 
approach has marked a number of significant points 
firstly flexibility of protocol specifications in our 
framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives 
of tll and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of 
agents on resources and actions while and refer to 
internal choices and external choices in time domain given 
that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice 
having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of 
interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to 
reason about the right choices during interaction and hence 
explore the flexibility in them 
secondly instead of being sequences of interactive actions 
protocols are structured on commitments which are more 
abstract than protocol actions execution of protocols is 
then based on fulfilling commitments hence unnecessary 
constraints on which particular interactive actions to 
execute by which agents and on the order among them are 
now removed which is a step forward to flexibility as 
compared to traditional approaches on the other hand in the 
presence of changes introduced externally agents have the 
freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip 
some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill 
the protocol s commitments this brings more flexibility to 
the overall level of agents interactive behaviors and thus 
the protocol 
thirdly the protocol is specified in a declarative manner 
essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each 
participating agents to achieve goals agents use reasoning based 
on tll sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from 
pre-commitments and state formulas this essentially gives 
agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and 
hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly 
deal with changing environments 
in particular as proof construction by agents selects a 
sequence of pre-commitments for interaction being able to 
select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments 
in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than 
selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences it 
is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions 
or explore opportunities that arise moreover as the actual 
order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof 
construction process rather than predefined agents can flexibly 
change the order to suit new situations 
fourthly changes in the environment can be regarded as 
removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas 
because the proof construction by agents takes into account the 
current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments 
changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice 
of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed hence the 
agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal 
with changes 
lastly specifying protocols in our framework has a 
modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing 
process of protocols protocols are specified by placing a set 
of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to 
their roles each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as 
a process in its own with condition formulas as its input 
and commitment part s formulas as its output execution 
of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent 
thread and they are linked together by the proof search to 
fulfill agents commitments as a results with such a design 
of pre-commitments one pre-commitment can be added or 
removed without interfering the others and hence achieving 
a modular design of the protocols 
 limitations of tll framework on 
modeling 
as all the temporal operators in tll refer to concrete 
time points we can not express durations in time faithfully 
one major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event 
by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points 
a⊗ 
continuously like a⊗ 
 a is that it requires 
the time range to be provided explicitly hence such notion 
like until can not be naturally expressed in tll 
commitments of agents can be in conflict especially when 
resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than 
what agents have our work has not covered handling 
commitments that are in conflict 
another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the 
rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the 
formulas of temporal linear logic clearly it would be 
beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to uml diagrams 
which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate 
rules without having to learn the details of the formulas 
themselves 
 conclusions and further work 
this paper uses tll for specifying interaction protocols 
in particular tll is used to model the concept of resource 
capability pre-commitment and commitment with tight 
integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time 
agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform 
the desired interactions 
in particular the approach allows protocol specifications 
to capture the meaning of interactive actions via 
commitments to capture the internal choices and external choices of 
agents about resources commitments and about time as well 
as updating processes the proof construction mechanism 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
provides agents with the ability to dynamically select 
appropriate pre-commitments and hence help agents to gain the 
flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most 
suitable and the flexibility in the order of them taking into 
consideration on-going changes in the environment 
many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the 
commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents 
interactive actions approaches based on commitment 
machines endure a number of issues these 
approaches use logic systems that are limited in their 
expressiveness to model resources also as an extra abstract 
layer of commitments is created more tasks are created 
accordingly in particular there must be a human-designed 
mapping between protocol actions and operations on 
commitments as well as between control variables fluent and 
phases of commitment achievement moreover external 
mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle 
operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement 
of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type 
representations this requires another execution in the 
commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of 
the protocol not only these extra tasks create an overhead 
but also makes the specification and execution of protocols 
more error prone 
similar works in and explore the advantages of 
linear logic and tll respectively by using partial deduction 
techniques to help agents to figure out the missing 
capabilities or resources and based on that to negotiate with other 
agents about cooperation strategies our approach differs 
in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of 
interaction and providing a more natural and detailed map 
for specifying interaction especially about choices time and 
updating using the full propositional tll moreover we 
emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules 
with a full set of tll inference rules to provide the 
advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction 
our further work will include using tll to verify 
various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and 
safety also we will investigate developing an execution 
mechanism for such tll specifications in our framework
