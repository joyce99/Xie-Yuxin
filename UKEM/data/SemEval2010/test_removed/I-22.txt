abstract 
human team members often develop shared expectations to 
predict each other s needs and coordinate their behaviors 
in this paper the concept shared belief map is proposed 
as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among 
a team of human-agent-pairs haps the establishment 
of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information 
sharing the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents 
processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their 
human partners we investigate hmm-based cognitive load 
models to facilitate team members to share the right 
information with the right party at the right time the shared 
belief map concept and the cognitive processing load models 
have been implemented in a cognitive agent 
architecturesmmall a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate 
the concept the models and their impacts on the evolving 
of shared mental models of hap teams

 introduction 
the entire movement of agent paradigm was spawned 
at least in part by the perceived importance of fostering 
human-like adjustable autonomy human-centered 
multiagent teamwork has thus attracted increasing attentions in 
multi-agent systems field humans and autonomous 
systems agents are generally thought to be 
complementary while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in 
information processing they are superior in spatial 
heuristic and analogical reasoning autonomous systems can 
continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving 
knowledge from humans to improve system performance in short 
humans and agents can team together to achieve better 
performance given that they could establish certain mutual 
awareness to coordinate their mixed-initiative activities 
however the foundation of human-agent collaboration 
keeps being challenged because of nonrealistic modeling of 
mutual awareness of the state of affairs in particular few 
researchers look beyond to assess the principles of modeling 
shared mental constructs between a human and his her 
assisting agent moreover human-agent relationships can go 
beyond partners to teams many informational processing 
limitations of individuals can be alleviated by having a group 
perform tasks although groups also can create additional 
costs centered on communication resolution of conflict and 
social acceptance it is suggested that such limitations can 
be overcome if people have shared cognitive structures for 
interpreting task and social requirements therefore there 
is a clear demand for investigations to broaden and deepen 
our understanding on the principles of shared mental 
modeling among members of a mixed human-agent team 
there are lines of research on multi-agent teamwork both 
theoretically and empirically for instance joint intention 
 and sharedplans are two theoretical frameworks for 
specifying agent collaborations one of the drawbacks is 
that although both have a deep philosophical and 
cognitive root they do not accommodate the modeling of 
human team members cognitive studies suggested that teams 
which have shared mental models are expected to have 
common expectations of the task and team which allow them 
to predict the behavior and resource needs of team 
members more accurately cannon-bowers et al 
explicitly argue that team members should hold compatible 
models that lead to common expectations we agree on 
this and believe that the establishment of shared 
expectations among human and agent team members is a critical 
step to advance human-centered teamwork research 
it has to be noted that the concept of shared expectation 
can broadly include role assignment and its dynamics 
teamwork schemas and progresses communication patterns and 
intentions etc while the long-term goal of our research is 
to understand how shared cognitive structures can enhance 
human-agent team performance the specific objective of the 
work reported here is to develop a computational cognitive 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
capacity model to facilitate the establishment of shared 
expectations in particular we argue that to favor 
humanagent collaboration an agent system should be designed to 
allow the estimation and prediction of human teammates 
 relative cognitive loads and use that to offer improvised 
unintrusive help ideally being able to predict the 
cognitive processing capacity curves of teammates could allow 
a team member to help the right party at the right time 
avoiding unbalanced work cognitive loads among the team 
the last point is on the modeling itself although an 
agent s cognitive model of its human peer is not necessarily 
to be descriptively accurate having at least a realistic model 
can be beneficial in offering unintrusive help bias 
reduction as well as trustable and self-adjustable autonomy for 
example although humans use of cognitive simplification 
mechanisms e g heuristics does not always lead to errors 
in judgment it can lead to predictable biases in responses 
 it is feasible to develop agents as cognitive aids to 
alleviate humans biases as long as an agent can be trained 
to obtain a model of a human s cognitive inclination with 
a realistic human cognitive model an agent can also better 
adjust its automation level when its human peer is 
becoming overloaded an agent can take over resource-consuming 
tasks shifting the human s limited cognitive resources to 
tasks where a human s role is indispensable when its 
human peer is underloaded an agent can take the chance to 
observe the human s operations to refine its cognitive model 
of the human many studies have documented that human 
choices and behaviors do not agree with predictions from 
rational models if agents could make recommendations in 
ways that humans appreciate it would be easier to establish 
trust relationships between agents and humans this in turn 
will encourage humans automation uses 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 
 we review cognitive load theories and measurements a 
hmm-based cognitive load model is given in section to 
support resource-bounded teamwork among 
human-agentpairs section describes the key concept shared belief 
map as implemented in smmall and section reports the 
experiments for evaluating the cognitive models and their 
impacts on the evolving of shared mental models 
 cognitive capacity-overview 
people are information processors most cognitive 
scientists believe that human information-processing system 
consists of an executive component and three main 
information stores a sensory store which receives and retains 
information for one second or so b working or 
shortterm memory which refers to the limited capacity to hold 
 approximately seven elements at any one time retain 
 for several seconds and manipulate two or three 
information elements simultaneously information and c 
longterm memory which has virtually unlimited capacity and 
contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized 
as schemata cognitive load studies are by and large 
concerned about working memory capacity and how to 
circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such 
as learning and decision making 
according to the cognitive load theory cognitive load 
is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the 
load that a particular task imposes on the performer it 
has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be 
characteristics of the subject e g expertise level the task 
 e g task complexity time pressure the environment e g 
noise and their mutual relations it also has an 
assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of 
mental load imposed exclusively by the task and environmental 
demands mental effort the cognitive capacity actually 
allocated to the task and performance 
lang s information-processing model consists of three 
major processes encoding storage and retrieval the 
encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores 
that are relevant to a person s goals into working memory 
the storage process consolidates the newly encoded 
information into chunks and form associations and schema to 
facilitate subsequent recalls the retrieval process searches the 
associated memory network for a specific element schema 
and reactivates it into working memory the model 
suggests that processing resources cognitive capacity are 
independently allocated to the three processes in addition 
working memory is used both for holding and for 
processing information due to limited capacity when greater 
effort is required to process information less capacity 
remains for the storage of information hence the allocation 
of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in 
order to enhance human performance this comes to the issue 
of measuring cognitive load which has proven difficult for 
cognitive scientists 
cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load 
mental effort and performance using rating scales 
psychophysiological e g measures of heart activity brain 
activity eye activity and secondary task techniques 
selfratings may appear questionable and restricted especially 
when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time 
although physiological measures are sometimes highly 
sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load costs 
and work place conditions often favor task- and 
performancebased techniques which involve the measure of a secondary 
task as well as the primary task under consideration 
secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that 
performance on a secondary task reflects the level of 
cognitive load imposed by a primary task from the resource 
allocation perspective assuming a fixed cognitive capacity 
any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary 
task must inevitably decrease resources available for the 
secondary task consequently performance in a secondary 
task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary 
task increases the level of cognitive load can thus be 
manifested by the secondary task performance the subject is 
getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops 
a secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or 
auditory signal but requires sustained attention its 
performance can be measured in terms of reaction time accuracy 
and error rate however one important drawback of 
secondary task performance as noted by paas is that it 
can interfere considerably with the primary task 
 competing for limited capacity especially when the primary task is 
complex to better understand and measure cognitive load 
xie and salvendy introduced a conceptual framework 
which distinguishes instantaneous load peak load 
accumulated load average load and overall load it seems that 
the notation of instantaneous load which represents the 
dynamics of cognitive load over time is especially useful for 
monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can 
be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the 
overall performance in human-agent collaborations

figure human-centered teamwork model 
 human-centered teamwork model 
people are limited information processors and so are 
intelligent agent systems this is especially true when they act 
under hard or soft timing constraints imposed by the domain 
problems in respect to our goal to build realistic 
expectations among teammates we take two important steps 
first agents are resource-bounded their processing 
capacity is limited by computing resources inference 
knowledge concurrent tasking capability etc we withdraw the 
assumption that an agent knows all the information intentions 
communicated from other teammates instead we contend 
that due to limited processing capacity an agent may only 
have opportunities to process make sense of a portion of 
the incoming information with the rest ignored taking 
this approach will largely change the way in which an agent 
views models the involvement and cooperativeness of its 
teammates in a team activity in other words the 
establishment of shared mental models regarding team members 
beliefs intentions and responsibilities can no longer rely on 
inter-agent communication only this being said we are not 
dropping the assumption that teammates are trustable 
we still stick to this only that team members cannot 
overtrust each other an agent has to consider the possibility that 
its information being shared with others might not be as 
effective as expected due to the recipients limited 
processing capacities second human teammates are bounded by 
their cognitive capacities as far as we know the research 
reported here is the first attempt in the area of 
humancentered multi-agent teamwork that really considers 
building and using human s cognitive load model to facilitate 
teamwork involving both humans and agents 
we use hi ai to denote human-agent-pair hap i 
 computational cognitive capacity model 
an intelligent agent being a cognitive aid it is desirable 
that the model of its human partner implemented within 
the agent is cognitively-acceptable if not descriptively 
accurate of course building a cognitive load model that is 
cognitively-acceptable is not trivial there exist a variety of 
cognitive load theories and different measuring techniques 
we here choose to focus on the performance variables of 
secondary tasks given the ample evidence supporting 
secondary task performance as a highly sensitive and reliable 
technique for measuring human s cognitive load it s 
worth noting that just for the purpose of estimating a 
human subject s cognitive load any artificial task e g pressing 
a button in response to unpredictable stimuli can be used 
as a secondary task to force the subject to go through 
however in a realistic application we have to make sure that the 
selected secondary task interacts with the primary task in 
meaningful ways which is not easy and often depends on the 
domain problem at hand for example in the experiment 
below we used the number of newly available information 
correctly recalled as the secondary task and the 
effective 
negligibly slightly fairly heavily overly

figure a hmm cognitive load model 
ness of information sharing as the primary task this is 
realistic to intelligence workers because in time stress 
situations they have to know what information to share in order 
to effectively establish an awareness of the global picture 
in the following we adopt the hidden markov model 
 hmm approach to model human s cognitive 
capacity it is thus assumed that at each time step the secondary 
task performance of a human subject in a team composed 
of human-agent-pairs hap is observable to all the team 
members human team members secondary task 
performance is used for estimating their hidden cognitive loads 
a hmm is denoted by λ n v a b π where n is a 
set of hidden states v is a set of observation symbols a 
is a set of state transition probability distributions b is a 
set of observation symbol probability distributions one for 
each hidden state and π is the initial state distribution 
we consider a -state hmm model of human cognitive 
load as follows figure the hidden states are 
 negligiblyloaded slightly-loaded fairly-loaded 
 heavilyloaded and overly loaded the observable states are 
tied with secondary task performance which in this study 
is measured in terms of the number of items correctly 
recalled according to miller s ± rule the observable states 
take integer values from to the state is when the 
number of items correctly recalled is no less than for 
the example b matrix given in fig it is very likely that 
the cognitive load of the subject is negligibly when the 
number of items correctly recalled is larger than 
however to determine the current hidden load status of 
a human partner is not trivial the model might be 
oversensitive if we only consider the last-step secondary task 
performance to locate the most likely hidden state there 
is ample evidence suggesting that human cognitive load is 
a continuous function over time and does not manifest 
sudden shifts unless there is a fundamental changes in tasking 
demands to address this issue we place a constraint on 
the state transition coefficients no jumps of more than 
states are allowed in addition we take the position that 
a human subject is very likely overloaded if his secondary 
task performance is mostly low in recent time steps while 
he is very likely not overloaded if his secondary task 
performance is mostly high recently this leads to the following 
windowed-hmm approach 
given a pre-trained hmm λ of human cognitive load and 
the recent observation sequence ot of length w let 
parameter w be the effective window size ελ 
t be the estimated 
hidden state at time step t first apply the hmm to the 
observation sequence to find the optimal sequence of hidden 
states sλ 
t s s · · · sw viterbi algorithm then compute 
the estimated hidden state ελ 
t for the current time step 
viewing it as a function of sλ 
t we consider all the hidden states 
in sλ

 agent processing load model 
according to schema theory multiple elements of 
information can be chunked as single elements in cognitive 
schemas a schema can hold a huge amount of information 
yet is processed as a single unit we adapt this idea and 
assume that agent i s estimation of agent j s processing load 
at time step t is a function of two factors the number of 
chunks cj t and the total number sj t of information 
being considered by agent j if cj t and sj t are observable 
to agent i agent i can employ a windowed-hmm approach 
as described in section to model and estimate agent j s 
instantaneous processing load 
in the study reported below we also used -state hmm 
models for agent processing load with the hidden states 
similar to the hmm models adopted for human cognitive 
load we employed multivariate gaussian observation 
probability distributions for the hidden states 
 hap s processing load model 
as discussed above a human-agent-pair hap is viewed 
as a unit when teaming up with other haps the processing 
load of a hap can thus be modeled as the co-effect of the 
processing load of the agent and the cognitive load of the 
human partner as captured by the agent 
suppose agent ai has models for its processing load and 
its human partner hi s cognitive load denote the agent 
processing load and human cognitive load of hap hi ai 
at time step t by μi 
t and νi 
t respectively agent ai can use μi 
t 
and νi 
t to estimate the load of hi ai as a whole similarly 
if μj 
t and νj 
t are observable to agent ai it can estimate the 
load of hj aj for model simplicity we still used -state 
hmm models for hap processing load with the estimated 
hidden states of the corresponding agent processing load and 
human cognitive load as the input observation vectors 
building a load estimation model is the means the goal 
is to use the model to enhance information sharing 
performance so that a team can form better shared mental models 
 e g to develop inter-agent role expectations in their 
collaboration which is the key to high team performance 
 load-sensitive information processing 
each agent has to adopt a certain strategy to process the 
incoming information as far as resource-bounded agents 
are concerned it is of no use for an agent to share 
information with teammates who are already overloaded they 
simply do not have the capacity to process the information 
consider the incoming information processing strategy as 
shown in table agent ai of hapi ignores all the 
incoming information when it is overloaded and processes all the 
incoming information when it is negligibly loaded when it 
table incoming information processing strategy 
hapi load strategy

 q is a fifo queue of agents from whom this hap has received 
information at the current step q is a constant known to all 
is heavily loaded ai randomly processes half of the messages 
from those agents which are the first q teammates 
appeared in its communication queue when it is fairly loaded 
ai randomly processes half of the messages from any 
teammates when it is slightly loaded ai processes all the 
messages from those agents which are the first q teammates 
appeared in its communication queue and randomly 
processes half of the messages from other teammates 
to further encourage sharing information at the right time 
the last row of table says that hapi if having not sent 
information to hapj who is currently overloaded will 
process all the information from hapj this can be justified 
from resource allocation perspective an agent can reallocate 
its computing resource reserved for communication to 
enhance its capacity of processing information this strategy 
favors never sending information to an overloaded 
teammate and it suggests that estimating and exploiting 
others loads can be critical to enable an agent to share the 
right information with the right party at the right time 
 system implementation 
smmall shared mental models for all is a cognitive 
agent architecture developed for supporting human-centric 
collaborative computing it stresses human s role in team 
activities by means of novel collaborative concepts and 
multiple representations of context woven through all aspects of 
team work here we describe two components pertinent to 
the experiment reported in section multi-party 
communication and shared mental maps a complete description of 
the smmall system is beyond the scope of this paper 
 multi-party communication 
multi-party communication refers to conversations 
involving more than two parties aside from the speaker the 
listeners involved in a conversation can be classified into 
various roles such as addressees the direct listeners auditors 
 the intended listeners overhearers the unintended but 
anticipated listeners and eavesdroppers the unanticipated 
listeners multi-party communication is one of the 
characteristics of human teams smmall agents which can form 
human-agent-pairs with human partners support 
multiparty communication with the following features 
 smmall supports a collection of multi-party 
performatives such as minform multi-party inform mannounce 
 multi-party announce and mask multi-party ask the 
listeners of a multi-party performative can be addressees 
auditors and overhearers which correspond to  to  cc and 
 bcc in e-mail terms respectively 
 smmall supports channelled-communication there 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
are three built-in channels agenttalk channel inter-agent 
activity-specific communication control channel meta 
communication for team coordination and world channel 
 communication with the external world an agent can fully 
tune to a channel to collect messages sent or cc bcc 
to it an agent can also partially tune to a channel to get 
statistic information about the messages communicated over 
the channel this is particularly useful if an agent wants to 
know the communication load imposed on a teammate 
 shared belief map load display 
a concept shared belief map has been proposed and 
implemented into smmall this responds to the need to seek 
innovative perspectives or concepts that allow group 
members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental 
models at different levels of abstraction as described in 
section humans and agents interacted through shared belief 
maps in the evaluation of hmm-based load models 
a shared belief map is a table with color-coded 
info-cellscells associated with information each row captures the 
belief model of one team member and each column 
corresponds to a specific information type all columns together 
define the boundary of the information space being 
considered thus info-cell cij of a map encodes all the beliefs 
 instances of information type j held by agent i color 
coding applies to each info-cell to indicate the number of 
information instances held by the corresponding agent 
the concept of shared belief map helps maintain and 
present a human partner with a synergy view of the shared 
mental models evolving within a team briefly smmall has 
implemented the concept with the following features 
 a context menu can be popped up for each info-cell 
to view and share the associated information instances it 
allows selective selected subset or holistic info-sharing 
 mixed-initiative info-sharing both agents and human 
partners can initiate a multi-party conversation it also 
allows third-party info-sharing say a shares the information 
held by b with c 
 information types that are semantically related e g 
by inference rules can be closely organized hence nearby 
info-cells can form meaningful plateaus or contour lines of 
similar colors colored plateaus indicate those sections of a 
shared mental model that bear high overlapping degrees 
 the perceptible color hue difference manifested from 
a shared belief map indicates the information difference among 
team members and hence visually represents the potential 
information needs of each team member see figure 
smmall has also implemented the hmm-based models 
 section to allow an agent to estimate its human 
partner s and other team members cognitive processing loads 
as shown in fig below the shared belief map there is 
a load display for each team member there are curves in 
a display the blue dark one plots human s instantaneous 
cognitive loads and the red one plots the processing loads of 
a hap as a whole if there are n team members each agent 
needs to maintain n hmm-based models to support the 
load displays the human partner of a hap can adjust her 
cognitive load at runtime as well as monitor another hap s 
agent processing load and its probability of processing the 
information she sends at the current time step thus the 
more closely a hap can estimate the actual processing loads 
of other haps the better information sharing performance 
the hap can achieve 
figure shared mental map display 
in sum shared belief maps allow the inference of who 
needs what and load displays allow the judgment of when 
to share information together they allow us to investigate 
the impact of sharing the right info with the right party at 
the right time on the evolving of shared mental models 
 metrics for shared mental models 
we here describe how we measure team performance in 
our experiment we use mental model overlapping 
percentage mmop as the base to measure shared mental 
models mmop of a group is defined as the intersection of 
all the individual mental states relative to the union of 
individual mental states of the group formally given a group 
of k agents g ai ≤ i ≤ k let bi iim ≤ m ≤ n 
be the beliefs information held by agent ai where each 
iim is a set of information of the same type and n the size 
of information space is fixed for the agents in g then 
mmop g 
 
n 
 ≤m≤n 
 
 ∩ ≤i≤k iim 
 ∪ ≤i≤k iim 
 
first a shared mental model can be measured in terms of 
the distance of averaged subgroup mmops to the mmop 
of the whole group without losing generality we define 
paired smm distance subgroups of size d as 
d g 
 ≤i j≤k 
 mmop ai aj − mmop g 
 
the mmop of a subgroup is always larger than the mmop 
of the whole group intuitively the larger distance from the 
mmop of a subgroup to that of the whole group the more 
overlapping mental models the subgroup shares this 
notion can be used to measure the tightness of an emerging 
subgroup or guide the process of team coalition 
second due to communication or information processing 
limits each individual s subjective measure of the group s 
mmop can be very different from the group s mmop 
measured objectively from external a shared mental model can 
thus be measured in terms of the closeness of individuals 
measure of the group s mmop to the objective measure let 
mmop g and m mopi g be the objective measure and 
agent ai s subjective measure of the group s shared mental 
models respectively we define smm deviation d⊥ as 
d⊥ g 
 ≤i≤k 
 mmopi g − mmop g 
 
obviously d⊥ measures the coherency of the whole group 
the smaller the better 
third shared mental models evolve over time a shared 
mental model can be measured in terms of the 
stableness of the instantaneous measures of mmop d or d⊥ 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
over time high performing teams can often maintain their 
shared mental models such that the mmop is stable at an 
acceptable level as activities proceed while the mmop 
measure of the shared mental models of a low-performing teams 
can fluctuate or decrease notably over time 
 experiment evaluation 
in this section we describe the experiments conducted to 
evaluate the load estimation models and the shared belief 
map concept for developing team shared mental models 
 problem description 
the members of a hap team i e a team composed 
of human-agent-pairs are situated in a dynamic 
environment due to their different maybe overlapping 
observability at each time step they may get different situational 
information the goal of a hap team is to selectively share 
information in a timely manner to develop global situation 
awareness say for making critical decisions 
each run of the experiment has time steps each time 
step lasts seconds a time step starts with certain 
infocells of the shared belief map being flashed quickly for 
s the flashed cells are exactly those with newly available 
information that should be shared at that time step an 
info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step the associated 
information is no longer sharable this requires that the 
newly available information be shared in time not later 
the human and agent of a hap assume different roles 
an agent governs group communication and processes 
messages to update the shared belief map on its display an 
agent with a pre-trained hmm-based cognitive load model 
for its human partner and a processing load model for each 
of the other haps in the team also estimates and displays 
their instantaneous loads human subjects need to perform 
a primary task and a secondary task the secondary task of 
a human subject is to remember and mark the cells being 
flashed not necessarily in the exact order by left mouse 
clicks secondary task performance at step t is thus 
measured as the number of cells marked remembered correctly 
at t which is taken as the observable state of the 
hmmbased cognitive load model of that human subject the 
primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental 
model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right 
information with the right party at the right time to share the 
information associated with an info-cell a human subject 
needs to click the right mouse button on the cell and select 
the receiving teammate s from the popup menu 
there are costs associated with information sharing 
communications among haps is done by the corresponding 
smmall agents which have both limited capacity nin for 
processing incoming information and limited outgoing 
communication capacity nout thus depending on the current hap 
load an agent may randomly ignore part or all of the 
incoming information having no effect on the establishment of 
shared mental models on the other hand each time step 
at most nout number of information-sharing commands can 
be effective more than that contribute nothing to the 
establishment of shared mental models sending information 
to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that 
otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded 
teammate this means that at each time step a human 
subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions 
whether the information under consideration needs to be 
shared i e whether it is associated with an info-cell just 
flashed whether a team member is the right party to share 
the information with i e whether it really needs the 
information and whether this is the right time to share i e 
whether the team member is currently overloaded 
the above description applies to hap teams for teams 
composed of smmall agents only the agents will take all the 
roles played by an agent or a human partner in hap teams 
 experiment design 
to investigate the impacts of the hmm-based load models 
on the evolution of shared mental models smm we 
conducted experiments for both agent teams and hap teams 
where agent teams involve agent processing load models 
only hap teams involve models of hap processing load 
 i e the co-effect of agent processing load and human 
cognitive load to get insights on how load predictions and 
multi-party communication may affect the performance of 
forming smm we designed agent teams ta ta ta 
and hap teams th th th where all agents adopt 
the strategy in table to send and process information 
when sharing information teams of type ta th 
ignore load predictions teams of type ta th 
consider load predictions teams of type ta th follow 
load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents 
will further group the receivers of a multi-party message 
 minform by their loads and split the message into 
multiple messages with their receivers having the same load 
for example given that agents a a a have load 
 respectively an agent a in a team of ta may send 
one multi-party message while an agent a in a team of 
ta will send two messages one to a one to a and a 
in addition we controlled agents outgoing communication 
capacities by varying from to 
due to constraints on communication capacity and 
processing capacity an agent can be inaccurate when tracking 
other teammates mental models in order to measure the 
actual shared mental models a special smmall agent named 
 omniall was added to each team to monitor inter-agent 
communications and record the actual effects of 
information sharing on each agent s mental model this realizes a 
way as suggested by klimoski to measuring the degree of 
overlap in immediate intermediate and long-term situation 
awareness zones held by group members 
we also recorded instantaneous information sharing 
utility which is defined as follows at each time step let t 
t t t t t be a sequence of sets where t t t t 
and t are sets of teammates whose current load states are 
negligibly slightly fairly heavily and overly 
respectively let s be the set of information-sharing 
commands issued by a human partner at the current step let 
mi tk ∈ t k ≤ i tk ∅ instantaneous info-sharing 
utility is defined as c∈s s value c s where 
s value c

figure evolution of smms 
consider teams of type ta th and teams of type 
 ta th first look at the performance of hap teams 
in fig we have for each team type the performance 
 percentage of smm overtime averaged over teams 
increased as communication capacity increased 
 th - th th - th - th - th - the averaged 
performance of th teams performed consistently better than 
the th teams for each capacity setting th - th - 
th - th - th - th - and the performance 
difference of th and th teams increased as communication 
capacity increased this indicates that other things being 
equal the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing 
information becomes more significant when communication 
capacity is larger from fig the same findings can be 
derived for the performance of agent teams 
in addition the results also show that the smms of each 
team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after 
about time steps however to maintain a smm steadily 
at a certain level is a non-trivial team task the performance 
of teams who did not share any information the  nosharing 
curve in fig decreased constantly as time proceeded 
 multi-party communication for smm 
we now compare teams of type and type which splits 
multi-party messages by receivers loads as plotted in fig 
 for hap teams the performance of team type for each 
fixed communication capacity was consistently better than 
team type th - ≤th - th - th - 
th - th the difference became more significant as 
communication capacity increased these also hold for the agent teams

figure multi-party messages 
agent teams was even worse for each fixed capacity than 
the performance of type agent teams 
this can be explained by the difference of two-party and 
multi-party communications in smmall in order to enable 
team-level inference each agent maintains an internal model 
of every team member s mental model beliefs according 
to the semantics of minform multi-party inform when a 
minforms i to others assuming all the receivers and 
overhearers will accept i a will update its internal model of 
their beliefs each of the receivers overhearers upon 
getting the message will update its own beliefs as well as its 
model of the sender s and all the other receivers beliefs 
compared to two-party performatives multi-party 
performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models 
as illustrated in fig a agent a only needs to perform 
minform once with b and c being receivers to achieve 
the common knowledge of the shared belief about i it 
consumes of a s communication resources one for each 
receiver however to achieve the same effects using inform 
 fig b it is hard to form team-level smm especially 
when the team size is big missing one inform will nullify all 
others efforts moreover although agent a still consumes 
 the whole team needs more resources in this case 
however splitting multi-party messages by receivers loads 
does enhance subgroup smms in fig we plotted the 
other two measures of smms distance and closeness as 
defined in sec for hap teams th th th 
holds in fig c larger distances indicate better 
subgroup smms and th th th holds in fig d 
 smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole 
team thus hap teams of type achieved better subgroup 
smms and their team members had higher coherent view 
of group smms than teams of other types for agent teams 
th th th holds in fig a and th th th 
holds in fig b thus agent teams of type achieved 
better subgroup smms and their team members had much 
higher coherent view of group smms than teams of type 
 although slightly worse than team type 
hence generally multi-party communication encourages 
the forming evolving of team smms when a group of 
agents can be partitioned into subteams splitting messages 
by their loads can be more effective for subteam smms 
 the hmm-based cognitive model 
to validate the hmm-based cognitive load model is 
extremely difficult because detecting the real noise-resistant 
cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current 
technology as an indirect judgment we plotted the 
regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility 
of hap teams with and without load displays for the hap 
teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear 
relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load 
levels pearson correlation coefficient is − 
√ 
 − 
with p-value because the info-sharing utility 
measure and the cognitive load measure are indicators of 
primary task performance and secondary task performance 
respectively their linear relationship complies with 
cognitive studies that secondary task performance can be used

with p-value this indicates that the information 
sharing performance of a hap team can be significantly 
affected by both the human subject s own cognitive load and 
the awareness of other team members load knowing of 
others load by estimation will reduce the quadratic relation 
to a linear relation

 conclusion 
recent research attention on human-centered teamwork 
highly demands the design of agent systems as cognitive 
aids that can model and exploit human partners cognitive 
capacities to offer help unintrusively in this paper we 
investigated several factors surrounding the challenging 
problem of evolving shared mental models of teams composed of 
human-agent-pairs the major contribution of this research 
includes hmm-based load models were proposed for an 
agent to estimate its human partner s cognitive load and 
other hap teammates processing loads the shared 
belief map concept was introduced and implemented it allows 
group members to effectively represent and reason about 
shared mental models experiments were conducted to 
evaluate the hmm-based cognitive processing load models 
and the impacts of multi-party communication on the 
evolving of team smms the usefulness of shared belief maps was 
also demonstrated during the experiments
