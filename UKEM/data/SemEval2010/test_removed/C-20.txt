 introduction 
a significant concern for internet-based service providers is the 
continued operation and availability of services in the face of 
outages whether planned or unplanned these concerns are 
exacerbated by the increased use of the internet for mission critical 
business and real-time entertainment applications a relatively minor 
outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users 
today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers 
recent advances in server virtualization technologies 
allow for the live migration of services within a local area network 
 lan environment in the lan environment these 
technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center 
management in a non-disruptive fashion not only can it support 
planned maintenance events but it can also be used in a more 
dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the 
physical servers in a data center when using these technologies 
in a lan environment services execute in a virtual server and the 
migration services provided by the underlying virtualization 
framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical 
server to another without any significant downtime for the service 
or application in particular since the virtual server retains the 
same network address as before any ongoing network level 
interactions are not disrupted similarly in a lan environment storage 
requirements are normally met via either network attached storage 
 nas or via a storage area network san which is still 
reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued 
storage access 
unfortunately in a wide area environment wan live server 
migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons first live 
migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network 
address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated 
server is indistinguishable from the original while this is fairly 
easily achieved in a shared lan environment no current 
mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a wan 
environment second while fairly sophisticated remote 
replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster 
recovery these mechanisms are ill suited to live data 
center migration because in general the available technologies are 
unaware of application service level semantics 
in this paper we outline a design for live service migration across 
wans our design makes use of existing server virtualization 
technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate 
migration across a wan the essence of our approach is 
cooperative context aware migration where a migration management 
system orchestrates the data center migration across all three 
subsystems involved namely the server platforms the wide area network 
and the disk storage system while conceptually similar in nature 
to the lan based work described above using migration 
technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has 
to our knowledge not been achieved our main contribution is the 
design of a framework that will allow the migration across a wan 
of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services we 
describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing 
technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative context aware 
functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this 
 
 live data center migration 
across wans 
three essential subsystems are involved with hosting services in 
a data center first the servers host the application or service logic 
second services are normally hosted in a data center to provide 
shared access through a network either the internet or virtual 
private networks vpns finally most applications require disk 
storage for storing data and the amount of disk space and the frequency 
of access varies greatly between different services applications 
disruptions failures or in general outages of any kind of any 
of these components will cause service disruption for this 
reason prior work and current practices have addressed the 
robustness of individual components for example data centers typically 
have multiple network connections and redundant lan devices 
to ensure redundancy at the networking level similarly physical 
servers are being designed with redundant hot-swappable 
components disks processor blades power supplies etc finally 
redundancy at the storage level can be provided through sophisticated 
data mirroring technologies 
the focus of our work however is on the case where such 
local redundancy mechanisms are not sufficient specifically we are 
interested in providing service availability when the data center as 
a whole becomes unavailable for example because of data center 
wide maintenance operations or because of catastrophic events as 
such our basic approach is to migrate services between data centers 
across the wide are network wan 
by necessity moving or migrating services from one data center 
to another needs to consider all three of these components 
historically such migration has been disruptive in nature requiring 
downtime of the actual services involved or requiring heavy weight 
replication techniques in the latter case concurrently running 
replicas of a service can be made available thus allowing a subset of the 
service to be migrated or maintained without impacting the 
service as a whole we argue that these existing mechanisms are 
inadequate to meet the needs of network-based services including 
real-time services in terms of continuous availability and 
operation instead we advocate an approach where server network and 
storage subsystems cooperate and coordinate actions in a manner 
that is cognizant of the service context in order to realize seamless 
migration across wide area networks 
in this section we briefly describe the technical building blocks 
that would enable our approach as outlined below some of these 
building blocks exist or exist in part while in other cases we use 
the desire for high availability of services as the driver for the 
changes we are proposing 
 live virtual server migration 
the main enabler for our approach is the live server migration 
capabilities that have been developed in the context of server 
virtualization in recent years in this approach an entire running 
operating system including any active applications executing as 
a virtual server is being transfered from one physical machine to 
another since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety both 
application and kernel level state gets migrated including any state 
associated with ongoing network connections assuming that 
network level reachability to the virtual server s network addresses are 
maintained after the migration the implication is that applications 
executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime in 
the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds and ongoing network 
connections remain intact 
in order to maintain network level reachability the ip address es 
associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical 
server where the virtual server is migrated to in a lan 
environment this is achieved either by issuing an unsolicited arp reply to 
establish the binding between the new mac address and the ip 
address or by relying on layer-two technologies to allow the virtual 
server to reuse its old mac address 
because of the difficulty of moving network level i e ip 
addresses in a routed non-lan environment use of live server 
migration as a management tool has been limited to the lan 
environments however virtual server migration across the wide area 
will also be an attractive tool specifically to deal with outages and 
therefore propose networking mechanisms to enable this 
if disk storage needs are being met with network attached storage 
 nas the storage becomes just another network based application 
and can therefore be addressed in the same way with lan based 
migration modern virtualization environments also include 
support for other forms of local storage including storage area 
networks sans however since we propose to use wan 
server migration as a means to deal with complete data center 
outages these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below 
we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can 
work in concert with server migration to minimize service 
downtime 
 networking requirements 
from the discussion above a key requirement for live server 
migration across a wan is the ability to have the ip address es of the 
virtual server be reachable at the new data center location 
immediately after the migration has completed this presents a significant 
challenge for a number of reasons first despite decades of work in 
this area ip address mobility remains an unresolved problem that is 
typically only addressed at manual configuration time scales the 
second challenge comes from the fact that current routing 
protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited 
to the time constraints imposed by live migration third in today s 
wan networking environment connectivity changes are typically 
initiated and controlled by network operators or network 
management systems again this is poorly suited to wan server migration 
where it is essential that the migration software which is closely 
monitoring the status of the server migration process initiate this 
change at the appropriate time 
our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live 
wan migration builds on the observations that not all networking 
changes in this approach are time critical and further that 
instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner 
specifically in our solution described in detail in section we allow the 
migration software to initiate the necessary networking changes as 
soon as the need for migration has been identified we make use 
of tunneling technologies during this initial phase to preemptively 
establish connectivity between the data centers involved once 
server migration is complete the migration software initiates a 
local change to direct traffic towards the new data center via the 
tunnel slower time scale network changes then phase out this local 
network connectivity change for a more optimal network wide path 
to the new data center 
 storage replication requirements 
data availability is typically addressed by replicating business 
data on a local primary storage system to some remote location 
from where it can be accessed from a business usability point of 
view such remote replication is driven by two metrics first 
 
is the recovery-point-objective which is the consistent data point to 
which data can be restored after a disaster second is the 
recoverytime-objective which is the time it takes to recover to that consistent 
data point after a disaster 
remote replication can be broadly classified into the following 
two categories 
 synchronous replication every data block written to a local 
storage system is replicated to the remote location before the 
local write operation returns 
 asynchronous replication in this case the local and remote 
storage systems are allowed to diverge the amount of 
divergence between the local and remote copies is typically 
bounded by either a certain amount of data or by a certain 
amount of time 
synchronous replication is normally recommended for 
applications such as financial databases where consistency between local 
and remote storage systems is a high priority however these 
desirable properties come at a price first because every data block 
needs to be replicated remotely synchronous replication systems 
can not benefit from any local write coalescing of data if the same 
data blocks are written repeatedly second because data have 
to be copied to the remote location before the write operation 
returns synchronous replication has a direct performance impact on 
the application since both lower throughput and increased latency 
of the path between the primary and the remote systems are 
reflected in the time it takes for the local disk write to complete 
an alternative is to use asynchronous replication however 
because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge 
asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event 
of a failure of the primary system but because write operations 
can be batched and pipelined asynchronous replication systems 
can move data across the network in a much more efficient 
manner than synchronous replication systems 
for wan live server migration we seek a more flexible 
replication system where the mode can be dictated by the migration 
semantics specifically to support live server migration we propose a 
remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between 
the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to 
benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation when the bulk of 
the data have been transfered in this manner replication switches 
to synchronous replication in anticipation of the completion of the 
server migration step the final server migration step triggers a 
simultaneous switch-over to the storage system at the new data 
center in this manner when the virtual server starts executing in the 
new data center storage requirements can be locally met 
 wan migration scenarios 
in this section we illustrate how our cooperative context aware 
approach can combine the technical building blocks described in 
the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide 
area network we demonstrate how the coordination of server 
virtualization and migration technologies the storage replication 
subsystem and the network can achieve live migration of the entire data 
center across the wan we utilize different scenarios to 
demonstrate our approach in section we outline how our approach 
can be used to achieve the safe live migration of a data center when 
planned maintenance events are handled in section we show 
the use of live server migration to mitigate the effects of unplanned 
outages or failures 
 maintenance outages 
we deal with maintenance outages in two parts first we 
consider the case where the service has no or very limited storage 
requirements this might for example be the case with a network 
element such as a voice-over-ip voip gateway second we deal 
with the more general case where the service also requires the 
migration of data storage to the new data center 
without requiring storage to be migrated without storage to 
be replicated the primary components that we need to coordinate 
are the server migration and network mobility figure shows 
the environment where the application running in a virtual server 
vs has to be moved from a physical server in data center a to a 
physical server in data center b 
prior to the maintenance event the coordinating migration 
management system mms would signal to both the server 
management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent 
the server management system would initiate the migration of the 
virtual server from physical server a ¢¤£¦¥ to physical server b 
 ¢¤£¦§ after an initial bulk state transfer as preparation for 
migration the server management system will mirror any state changes 
between the two virtual servers 
similarly for the network part based on the signal received 
from the mms the service provider edge ¢©¨ router will 
initiate a number of steps to prepare for the migration specifically 
as shown in figure b the migration system will cause the 
network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨ and ¢©¨ which will be used 
subsequently to transfer data destined to vs to data center b 
when the mms determines a convenient point to quiesce the vs 
another signal is sent to both the server management system and 
the network for the server management system this signal will 
indicate the final migration of the vs from data center a to data 
center b i e after this the vs will become active in data center b 
for the network this second signal enables the network data path to 
switchover locally at ¢©¨©¥ to the remote data center specifically 
from this point in time any traffic destined for the virtual server 
address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to 
¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center b 
note that at this point from a server perspective the migration is 
complete as the vs is now active in data center b however traffic 
is sub-optimally flowing first to ¢©¨©¥ and then across the tunnel 
to ¢©¨¤§ to rectify this situation another networking step is 
involved specifically ¢©¨©§ starts to advertise a more preferred route 
to reach vs than the route currently being advertised by ¢©¨¤¥ in 
this manner as ingress pes to the network ¢©¨¤ to ¢©¨¤ in 
figure receive the more preferred route traffic will start to flow to 
¢©¨©§ directly and the tunnel between ¢©¨©¥ and ¢©¨©§ can be torn 
down leading to the final state shown in figure c 
requiring storage migration when storage has to also be 
replicated it is critical that we achieve the right balance between 
performance impact on the application and the recovery point or 
data loss when the switchover occurs to the remote data center to 
achieve this we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously 
prior to any initiation of the maintenance event or assuming the 
amount of data to be transfered is relatively small asynchronous 
replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is 
expected to happen shortly asynchronous replication during this 
initial phase allows for the application to see no performance 
impact however when the maintenance event is imminent the mms 
would signal to the replication system to switch from asynchronous 
replication to synchronous replication to ensure that there is no 
loss of data during migration when data is being replicated 
synchronously there will be a performance impact on the application 
 
figure live server migration across a wan 
this requires us to keep the exposure to the amount of time we 
replicate on a synchronous basis to a minimum 
when the mms signals to the storage system the requirement 
to switch to synchronous replication the storage system completes 
all the pending asynchronous operations and then proceeds to 
perform all the subsequent writes by synchronously replicating it to 
the remote data center thus between the server migration and 
synchronous replication both the application state and all the 
storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the two data 
centers when all the pending write operations are copied over 
then as in the previous case we quiesce the application and the 
network is signaled to switch traffic over to the remote data center 
from this point on both storage and server migration operations 
are complete and activated in data center b as above the network 
state still needs to be updated to ensure optimal data flow directly 
to data center b 
note that while we have described the live server migration 
process as involving the service provider for the networking part it 
is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of 
functions without involving the service provider specifically by 
creating a tunnel between the customer edge ce routers in the 
data center and performing local switching on the appropriate ce 
rather than on the pe the data center provider can realize the same 
functionality 
 unplanned outages 
we propose to also use cooperative context aware migration to 
deal with unplanned data center outages there are multiple 
considerations that go into managing data center operations to plan 
and overcome failures through migration some of these are 
amount of overhead under normal operation to overcome 
anticipated failures amount of data loss affordable recovery point 
objective - rpo amount of state that has to be migrated and 
 time available from anticipated failure to occurrence of event 
at the one extreme one might incur the overhead of completely 
mirroring the application at the remote site this has the 
consequence of both incurring processing and network overhead under 
normal operation as well as impacting application performance 
 latency and throughput throughout the other extreme is to only 
ensure data recovery and to start a new copy of the application at the 
remote site after an outage in this case application memory state 
such as ongoing sessions are lost but data stored on disk is 
replicated and available in a consistent state neither this hot standby 
nor the cold standby approach described are desirable due to the 
overhead or the loss of application memory state 
an intermediate approach is to recover control and essential state 
of the application in addition to data stored on disk to further 
minimize disruptions to users a spectrum of approaches are possible 
in a voip server for instance session-based information can be 
mirrored without mirroring the data flowing through each session 
more generally this points to the need to checkpoint some 
application state in addition to mirroring data on disk checkpointing 
application state involves storing application state either periodically 
or in an application-aware manner like databases do and then 
copying it to the remote site of course this has the consequence that 
the application can be restarted remotely at the checkpoint 
boundary only similarly for storage one may use asynchronous 
replication with a periodic snapshot ensuring all writes are up-to-date 
at the remote site at the time of checkpointing some data loss 
may occur upon an unanticipated catastrophic failure but the 
recovery point may be fairly small depending on the frequency of 
checkpointing application and storage state coordination between 
 
the checkpointing of the application state and the snapshot of 
storage is key to successful migration while meeting the desired rpos 
incremental checkpointing of application and storage is key to 
efficiency and we see existing techniques to achieve this 
for instance rather than full application mirroring a virtualized 
replica can be maintained as a warm standby-in dormant or 
hibernating state-enabling a quick switch-over to the previously 
checkpointed state to make the switch-over seamless in addition 
to replicating data and recovering state network support is needed 
specifically on detecting the unavailability of the primary site the 
secondary site is made active and the same mechanism described 
in section is used to switch traffic over to reach the secondary 
site via the pre-established tunnel note that for simplicity of 
exposition we assume here that the pe that performs the local switch 
over is not affected by the failure the approach can however 
easily be extended to make use of a switchover at a router deeper in 
the network 
the amount of state and storage that has to be migrated may vary 
widely from application to application there may be many 
situations where in principle the server can be stateless for example 
a sip proxy server may not have any persistent state and the 
communication between the clients and the proxy server may be using 
udp in such a case the primary activity to be performed is in 
the network to move the communication over to the new data 
center site little or no overhead is incurred under normal operation to 
enable the migration to a new data center failure recovery involves 
no data loss and we can deal with near instantaneous catastrophic 
failures 
as more and more state is involved with the server more 
overhead is incurred to checkpoint application state and potentially 
to take storage snapshots either periodically or upon application 
prompting it also means that the rpo is a function of the 
interval between checkpoints when we have to deal with instantaneous 
failures the more advanced information we have of an impending 
failure the more effective we can be in having the state migrated 
over to the new data center so that we can still have a tighter rpo 
when operations are resumed at the new site 
 related work 
prior work on this topic falls into several categories virtual 
machine migration storage replication and network support 
at the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate 
applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without 
application downtimes most virtual machine software such as xen 
 and vmware support live migration of vms that involve 
extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a 
second details of xen s live migration techniques are discussed in 
 as indicated earlier these techniques assume that migration is 
being done on a lan vm migration has also been studied in the 
shirako system and for grid environments 
current virtual machine software support a suspend and resume 
feature that can be used to support wan migration but with 
downtimes recently live wan migration using ip tunnels was 
demonstrated in where an ip tunnel is set up from the source 
to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from 
the application we advocate an alternate approach that assumes 
edge router support 
in the context of storage there exist numerous commercial 
products that perform replication such as ibm extended remote copy 
hp continuous access xp and emc replistor an excellent 
description of these and others as well as a detailed taxonomy of the 
different approaches for replication can be found in the ursa 
minor system argues that no single fault model is optimal for all 
applications and proposed supporting data-type specific selections 
of fault models and encoding schemes for replication recently 
we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication where 
the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous 
replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to 
determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and 
asynchronously 
in the context of network support our work is related to the 
routerfarm approach which makes use of orchestrated 
network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge 
routers in addition to being in a different application area our 
approach differs from the routerfarm work in two regards first 
we propose to have the required network changes be triggered by 
functionality outside of the network as opposed to network 
management functions inside the network second due to the stringent 
timing requirements of live migration we expect that our approach 
would require new router functionality as opposed to being 
realizable via the existing configuration interfaces 
finally the recovery oriented computing roc work 
emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure avoidance in a 
similar spirit to roc we advocate using mechanisms from live vm 
migration to storage replication to support planned and unplanned 
outages in data centers rather than full replication to mask such 
failures 
 conclusion 
a significant concern for internet-based service providers is the 
continued operation and availability of services in the face of 
outages whether planned or unplanned in this paper we advocated 
a cooperative context-aware approach to data center migration 
across wans to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner we 
sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the 
face of both planned and incidental outages of data center 
facilities we advocated using server virtualization technologies to 
enable the replication and migration of server functions we proposed 
new network functions to enable server migration and replication 
across wide area networks such as the internet or a geographically 
distributed virtual private network and finally showed the utility 
of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure 
applications have access to data in the face of outages with very 
tight recovery point objectives
