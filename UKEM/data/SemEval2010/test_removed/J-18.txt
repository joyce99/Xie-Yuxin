abstract 
a mediator is a reliable entity which can play on behalf of 
agents in a given game a mediator however can not enforce 
the use of its services and each agent is free to participate 
in the game directly in this paper we introduce a study of 
mediators for games with incomplete information and 
apply it to the context of position auctions a central topic 
in electronic commerce vcg position auctions which are 
currently not used in practice possess some nice 
theoretical properties such as the optimization of social surplus 
and having dominant strategies these properties may not 
be satisfied by current position auctions and their variants 
we therefore concentrate on the search for mediators that 
will allow to transform current position auctions into vcg 
position auctions we require that accepting the 
mediator services and reporting honestly to the mediator will 
form an ex post equilibrium which satisfies the following 
rationality condition an agent s payoff can not be negative 
regardless of the actions taken by the agents who did not 
choose the mediator s services or by the agents who report 
false types to the mediator we prove the existence of such 
desired mediators for the next-price google-like position 
auctions as well as for a richer class of position auctions 
including all k-price position auctions k for k the 
self-price position auction we show that the existence of 
such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule used in the 
auction

 introduction 
consider an interaction in a multi-agent system in which 
every player holds some private information which is called 
the player s type for example in an auction interaction 
the type of a player is its valuation or in more complex 
auctions its valuation function every player has a set of 
actions and a strategy of a player is a function that maps 
each of its possible types to an action this interaction 
is modeled as a game with incomplete information this 
game is called a bayesian game when a commonly known 
probability measure on the profiles of types is added to the 
system otherwise it is called a pre-bayesian game in this 
paper we deal only with pre-bayesian games the leading 
solution concept for pre-bayesian games is the ex post 
equilibrium a profile of strategies one for each player such 
that no player has a profitable deviation independently of 
the types of the other players consider the following simple 
example of a pre-bayesian game which possesses an ex post 
equilibrium the game is denoted by h 
a b 
a 
b 
a 
a b 
a 
b 
b 
at the game h there are two players both players can 
choose among two actions a and b the column player 
player has a private type a or b player has only one 
possible type a strategy of player is g where g a or 
g b a strategy of player is a function g a b → 
 a b that is player has strategies in this game the 
strategy profile g g is an ex post equilibrium where g 
b and g a b g b a 
unfortunately pre-bayesian games do not in general 
possess ex post equilibria even if we allow mixed strategies in 
order to address this problem we suggest in this paper the 
use of mediators a mediator is a reliable entity that can 
interact with the players and perform on their behalf actions 
in a given game however a mediator can not enforce 
behavior indeed an agent is free to participate in the game 
without the help of the mediator the mediator s 
behavior on behalf of the agents that give it the right of play is 
pre-specified and is conditioned on information the agents 
would provide to the mediator this notion is highly 
natural in many systems there is some form of reliable party or 
 
administrator that can be used as a mediator the simplest 
form of a mediator discussed in the game theory literature 
is captured by the notion of correlated equilibrium this 
notion was generalized to communication equilibrium by 
 another type of mediators is discussed in however 
in all these settings the mediator can not perform actions 
on behalf of the agents that allow it to do so mediators 
that can obtain the right of play but can not enforce the 
use of their services have been already defined and discussed 
for games with complete information in 
the topic of 
mediators for games with complete information has been 
further generalized and analyzed in in this paper we 
introduce another use of mediators in establishing 
behaviors which are stable against unilateral deviations in games 
with incomplete information notice that we assume that 
the multi-agent interaction formalized as a game is given 
and all the mediator can do is to perform actions on behalf 
of the agents that explicitly allow it to do so 
in order to illustrate the power of mediators for games 
with incomplete information consider the following pre-bayesian 
game g that does not possess an ex post equilibrium in g 
the column player has two possible types a and b 
a b 
a 
b 
a 
a b 
a 
b 
b 
a mediator for g should specify the actions it will choose 
on behalf of the players that give it the right to play if 
player wants to give the mediator the right to play it should 
also report a type consider the following mediator 
if both players give the mediator the right of play then the 
mediator will play on their behalf a a if player reports 
a and b b if player reports b if only player gives the 
mediator the right of play then the mediator will choose a 
on his behalf if only player gives the mediator the right 
of play the mediator will choose action a resp b on its 
behalf if b resp a has been reported 
the mediator generates a new pre-bayesian game which 
is called the mediated game in the mediated game player 
 has three actions give the mediator the right of play 
denoted by m or play directly a or b player has four 
actions m − a m − b a b where m − a m − b means 
reporting a b to the mediator and give it the right of play 
the mediated game is described in the following figure 
m − a m − b a b 
m 
a 
b 
a 
 
for games with complete information the main interest is 
in leading agents to behaviors which are stable against 
deviations by coalitions a special case of mediators was already 
discussed in in this paper the authors discussed 
mediators for a two-person game which is known to the players 
but not to the mediators and they looked for nash 
equilibrium in the new game generated by the mediator 
 
this natural setting is different from the one discussed in 
the classical theories of implementation and mechanism 
design where a designer designs a new game from scratch in 
order to yield some desired behavior 
m − a m − b a b 
m 
a 
b 
b 
it is now easy to verify that giving the mediator the right 
of play and reporting truthfully is an ex-post equilibrium 
at the mediated game that is f f is an ex post 
equilibrium where f m and f a m−a f b m−b 
the aim of this paper is twofold we introduce mediators 
for games with incomplete information and apply them in 
the context of position auctions our choice of positions 
auctions as the domain of application is not an accident indeed 
positions auctions have become a central issue in 
advertisement and the selection of appropriate position auctions for 
that task is a subject of considerable amount of study 
 
current position auctions however do not possess 
ex-post equilibrium i e solutions which are stable against 
unilateral deviations regardless of the agents private 
information nor guarantee optimal social surplus in contrast 
in the vcg position auction which is currently not used 
in practice there is a truth-revealing ex post equilibrium 
which yields optimal surplus we therefore suggest the use 
of mediators in order to attempt and implement the output 
of the vcg position auction by transforming other and in 
particular current position auctions into a vcg position 
auction 
more specifically the mediated game will have 
an ex post equilibrium which generates the outcome of the 
vcg position auction one such mediator has already been 
discussed for other purposes in the literature an english 
auction type of algorithm was constructed in that takes 
as an input the valuations of the players and outputs bids for 
the next-price position auction it was proved there that 
reporting the true type to this algorithm by each player forms 
an ex post equilibrium which generates the vcg outcome 
in our language this algorithm can be almost considered as a 
mediator for the next-price position auction that implement 
the vcg outcome function what is missing is a 
component that punishes players who send their bids directly to 
the auctioneer and a proof that using the mediator services 
and reporting the true type by each player is an ex post 
equilibrium in the mediated game defined by the algorithm 
and by the additional component a mediator may generate 
a desired outcome by punishing the players who do not use 
its services with very high bids by the players that use its 
services we believe that such mediators are not realistic 
and therefore we concentrate on the search for valid 
mediators that generate an ex post equilibrium and satisfy the 
additional rationality condition an agent s payoff can not 
be negative regardless of the actions taken by the agents 
who did not choose the mediator s services or agents who 
report false types to the mediator we prove the existence 
of such desired mediators for the next-price google-like 
position auctions 
 as well as for a richer class of position 
auctions including all k-price position auctions k for 
k the self-price position auction we show that the 
ex 
see also where position auctions are titled ad auctions 
 
in general except for the vcg position auction we do not 
expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium 
 see footnote 
 
our proof uses an algorithm which is different from the 
algorithm in discussed earlier 
 
istence of such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule 
used in the auction 
mediators in one-item auctions in particular first price 
and second price auctions have been already discussed in 
 however they all used a bayesian model 
position auctions are a restricted type of general pre-bayesian 
games in this conference version we make the formal 
definition of mediators and implementing by mediation for the 
special case of position auctions and only in the full version 
we present the general theory of mediators for pre-bayesian 
games most of the proofs are omitted from this conference 
version 
 position auctions 
in a position auction there is a seller who sells a finite 
number of positions j ∈ k m there is a finite 
number of potential bidders i ∈ n n we assume 
that there are more bidders than positions i e n m 
the positions are sold for a fixed period of time for each 
position j there is a commonly-known number αj which 
is interpreted as the expected number of visitors at that 
position αj is called the click-through rate of position j 
we assume that α α αm if i holds a position 
then every visitor to this position gives i a revenue of vi 
where vi is called the valuation of i the set of possible 
valuations of i is vi ∞ 
we assume that the players utility functions are 
quasilinear that is if player i is assigned to position j and pays 
pi per click then his utility is αj vi − pi 
every player is required to submit a bid bi ∈ bi ∞ 
we assume that bidding is a symbol for non-participation 
therefore a player with a bid is not assigned to any 
position and it pays 
in all position auctions we consider the player with the 
highest positive bid receives the first position the player 
with the second highest positive bid receives the second 
position and so on it is useful to define for every position 
auction two dummy positions m and − which more 
than one player may be assigned to all players who 
participate in the auction but do not get a position in k are 
assigned to position m and all players who choose not 
to participate are assigned to position − we also define 
αm α− 
an assignment of players to positions is called an 
allocation hence an allocation is a vector s s s · · · sn 
with si ∈ k ∪ − m such that if si ∈ k then si sl 
for every l i si is the position of player i given the 
above a position auction is defined by its tie breaking rule 
which determines the allocation in case of ties and by its 
payment scheme these are discussed below 
 tie breaking rules 
in practice the most commonly used tie breaking rule 
is the first-arrival rule if a set of players submit the same 
bid their priority in receiving the positions is determined by 
the times their bids were recorded an earlier bid receives 
a higher priority in auction theory this tie breaking rule is 
typically modelled by assuming that the auctioneer is using 
a random priority rule more specifically let γ be the set of 
all permutations γ γ γn of n every such γ defines 
a priority rule as follows i has a higher priority than k if and 
only if γi γk every vector of bids b and a permutation 
γ uniquely determine an allocation an auctioneer who is 
using the random priority rule chooses a fixed priority rule 
γ by randomizing uniformly over γ however the resulting 
priority rule is not told to the players before they make their 
bids when the priority rule γ is told to the players before 
they make their bids the tie breaking rule is called a fixed 
priority rule dealing with a fixed priority rule simplifies 
notations and proofs and in most cases and in particular 
in this paper results that are obtained with this tie breaking 
rule are identical to the results obtained with the random 
priority rule therefore we will assume this tie breaking 
rule in contrast in section we discuss a non-standard 
approach for analyzing directly the first-arrival tie breaking 
rule 
unless we say specifically otherwise we assume in this 
paper a fixed priority rule 
without loss of generality we assume that the fixed 
priority rule is defined by the natural order ˜γ n 
that is bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and 
only if i k given this fixed priority rule we can make the 
following definitions which apply to all position auctions 
we denote by s b i the position player i is assigned to 
when the bid profile is b the allocation determined by b is 
denoted by 
s b s b s b · · · s b n 
for every j ∈ k ∪ − m we denote by δ b j the 
set of players assigned to position j note that for j ∈ k 
δ b j contains at most one player 
 the payment schemes 
let α be a click-trough rate vector each position j ∈ 
k ∪ − m is associated with a payment function 
pα 
j b → r where pα 
j b is the payment for position j 
when the bid profile is b naturally we assume that pα 
− 
is identically zero however we also assume that pα 
m is 
identically zero hence a participant who is not assigned a 
real position pays nothing 
we call the vector of payment functions pα 
 pα 
j j∈k the 
position payment scheme 
remark whenever α is fixed or its value is clear from the 
context we will allow ourselves to omit the superscript α 
from the payment and other functions 
we deal with anonymous position payment schemes i e 
the players payments to the auctioneer are not influenced 
by their identities this is modeled as follows let b ∈ b 
b × b × · · · × bn be a bid profile we denote by b j the 
jth 
highest bid in b for j n we let b j for example 
if b then b b b b 
 b we denote b 
 b · · · b n anonymity is 
modeled by the requirement that for every two bid profiles 
b d ∈ b p b p d whenever b 
 d 
 that is for 
every position j there exists a real-valued function ˜pj defined 
over all ordered vectors of bids such that for every b ∈ b 
pj b ˜pj b 
 
we further assume that a player never pays more than 
his bid that is pj b ≤ b j for every b ∈ b and for every 
j ∈ k 
it is convenient in certain cases to describe the payment 
functions indexed by the players let g be a position 
auction with a position payment scheme p 
for every player i we denote 
qi b ps b i b 
 
and 
q b q b q b · · · qn b 
note that the correspondence p → q is one-to-one we call q 
the player payment scheme all our assumptions about the 
position payment schemes can be transformed to analogous 
assumptions about the player payment schemes for 
convenience a position auction will be described either by its 
position payment scheme or by its player payment scheme 
the utility function for player i wi vi × b → r is 
defined as follows 
wi vi b αs b i vi − qi b αs b i vi − ps b i b 
 central position auctions 
we next describe the payment schemes of three central 
position auctions 
self-price position auctions each player who is assigned 
to a position with a positive click-through rate pays his own 
bid that is for every j ∈ k and every b ∈ b 
pj b b j 
next-price position auctions in this auction run with 
a slight variation by google every player who is assigned 
to a position with a positive click-through rate pays the bid 
of the player assigned to the position right after him if there 
is such a player and zero otherwise that is for every j ∈ k 
and for every b ∈ b 
pj b b j 
vcg position auctions in a vickrey-clarke-groves vcg 
position auction the payment function for position j ∈ k is 
defined as follows 
for every b ∈ b 
pvcg 
j b 
pm 
k j b k αk− − αk 
αj 
 
note that the vcg position auction is not the next-price 
position auction unless there is only one position and α 
 mediators for position auctions 
we denote by g g α p the position auction with 
the click-through rate vector α and the payment scheme 
p recall that the set of types of i is vi ∞ let 
v v × v × · · · × vn be the set of profile of types and for 
every s ⊆ n let vs ×i∈svi 
a mediator for g is a vector of functions m ms s⊆n 
where ms vs → bs the mediator m generates a 
prebayesian game gm which is called the mediated game in 
this game every player i receives his type vi and can either 
send a type ˆvi not necessarily the true type to the 
mediator or send a bid directly to the auction if s is the set of 
players that send a type to the mediator the mediator bids 
on their behalf ms ˆvs hence the action set of player i in 
the mediated game is bi ∪vi where conveniently vi denotes 
both ∞ and a copy of ∞ which is disjoint from 
 
we use the standard payment function of the vcg 
mechanism a general vcg mechanism may be obtained from 
the standard one by adding an additional payment function 
to each player which depends only on the types of the other 
players some authors see e g call the standard vcg 
mechanism the vc mechanism according to this 
terminology we actually deal with vc position auctions however 
we decided to use the more common terminology 
bi we introduce the following terminology the t-strategy 
for a player in the mediated game is the strategy in which 
this player uses the mediator s services and reports his true 
value to the mediator the t-strategy profile is the profile of 
strategies in which every player is using the t-strategy the 
t-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated 
game if for every player i and type vi and for every vector of 
types of the other players v−i the following two conditions 
hold 
e i is not better off when he gives the mediator the right 
of play and report a false type that is for every ˆvi ∈ vi 
wi vi mn vi v−i ≥ wi vi mn ˆvi v−i 
e i is not better off when he bids directly that is for 
every bi ∈ bi 
wi vi mn vi v−i ≥ wi vi bi mn\i v−i 
whenever the t-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium 
in gm the mediator m implements an outcome function 
in g this outcome function is denoted by ϕm 
 and it is 
defined as follows 
ϕm 
 v s mn v q mn v 
hence the range of the function ϕm 
is the cartesian product 
of the set of allocations with rn 
 
 implementing the vcg outcome 
function by mediation 
in general except for the vcg position auction we do not 
expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium 
therefore the behavior of the participants in most position 
auctions cannot be analytically predicted and in practice it 
can form a non-efficient allocation an allocation that does 
not maximize social surplus in contrast in the vcg 
position auction the truth-reporting strategy is a dominant 
strategy for every player and the resulting allocation is 
efficient given a position auction g our goal is to construct a 
mediator that would implement the outcome function of the 
vcg position auction this outcome function is defined as 
follows 
ϕvcg 
 v s v qvcg 
 v 
definition let g be a position auction let m be a 
mediator for g we say the m implements the vcg outcome 
function in g or that it implements ϕvcg 
in g if the 
tstrategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in gm and ϕm 
 
ϕvcg 
 
we demonstrate our definitions so far by a simple 
example 
example consider a self-price auction g g α p 
with players and one position with α that is g is 
a standard two-person first-price auction the 
corresponding vcg position auction is a standard second-price 
auction we define a family of mediators mc 
 c ≥ each of 
them implements the vcg position auction assume both 
 
actually it can be shown that if a strategy profile b in 
a position auction is an ex post equilibrium then for every 
player i bi is a dominant strategy it is commonly 
conjectured that except for some extremely artificial combinatorial 
auctions the vcg combinatorial auctions are the only ones 
with dominant strategies see 
 
players use the mediator s services and send him the types 
ˆv ˆv ˆv then all mediators act similarly and as follows 
if ˆv ≥ ˆv the mediator makes the following bids on behalf 
of the players b ˆv and b if ˆv ˆv the mediator 
makes the bids b b ˆv if only one player uses 
the mediator services say player i then mediator mc 
bids 
bi cˆvi on behalf of i we claim that for every c the 
t-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated 
game generated by mc 
 indeed assume player reports his 
type v to the mediator and consider player 
if v ≥ v then by using the t-strategy player receives the 
position and pays v hence s utility is v −v if player 
deviates by using the mediator s services and reporting ˆv ≥ 
v his utility is still v − v if he reports ˆv v his utility 
will be if player does not use the mediator he should 
bid at least cv in order to get the positions and therefore 
his utility cannot exceed v − v 
if v v then the t-strategy yields to player and 
any other strategy yields a non-positive utility 
obviously each of the mediators mc 
implements the vcg 
outcome function note however that the t-strategy is not 
a dominant strategy when c e g if v v and player 
 bids directly v without using the mediator services then 
bidding directly v is better for player than using the 
tstrategy in the former case player s utility is and in the 
latter case her utility is negative 
it is interesting to note that this simple example can not 
be extended to general self-price position auctions as will 
be discussed in section 
while each of the mediators mc 
in example implements 
the vcg outcome function the mediator with c has 
a distinct characteristic a player who uses the t-strategy 
cannot get a negative utility in contrast for every c if 
say player does not use the mediator services participates 
directly and bids less than cv then the t-strategy yields a 
negative utility of − c v to player this motivates our 
definition of valid mediators 
let g be a position auction a mediator for g is valid 
if for every player using the t-strategy guarantees a 
nonnegative level of utility 
formally a mediator m for g is valid if for every subset 
s ⊆ n and every player i ∈ s wi vi ms vs b−s ≥ for 
every b−s ∈ b−s and every vs ∈ vs 
 mediators in next-price position 
auctions 
we now show that there exists a valid mediator which 
implements the vcg outcome function in next-price position 
auctions although in the following section we prove a more 
general result we present this result first given the 
importance of next-price position auctions in the literature and 
in practice our proof makes use of the following technical 
lemma 
lemma let pvcg 
be the vcg payment scheme 
 pvcg 
j b ≤ b j for every j ∈ k 
 pvcg 
j b ≥ pvcg 
j b for every j m − and for 
every b ∈ b where for every j equality holds if and 
only if b j b j · · · b m 
the proof of lemma is given in the full version we can 
now show 
theorem let g be a next-price position auction there 
exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg 
in g 
theorem follows from a more general theorem given in the 
next section however we still provide a proof since a more 
simple and intuitive mediator is constructed for this case 
proof of theorem we define a mediator m which will 
implement the vcg outcome function in g for every v ∈ 
v let mn v b v where b v is defined as follows 
for every player i such that ≤ s v i ≤ m let bi v 
pvcg 
s v i − v 
for every i ∈ δ v m bi v pvcg 
m v 
let bδ v v max i s v i ≥ bi v 
for every s ⊆ n such that s n and for every vs ∈ vs 
let ms v vs this completes the description of the 
mediator m 
we show that ϕm 
 v ϕvcg 
 v for every v ∈ v let 
v ∈ v be an arbitrary valuation vector 
we have to show that s b v s v and that q b v 
qvcg 
 v 
we begin by showing that s b v s v it is sufficient 
to show that whenever ≤ s v i s v l ≤ m for 
some i l then s b v i s b v l 
we first show it for s v i that is δ v i in 
this case bδ v v bj v for every j i s b v i 
therefore s b v i s b v l if s v i we 
distinguish between two cases 
 vi vl since s v i s v l the fixed priority rule 
implies that i l by the second part of lemma 
pvcg 
s v i − v ≥ pvcg 
s v l − v therefore bi v ≥ bl v 
which yields s b v i s b v l 
 vi vl let j s v i that is v j vi and 
therefore by the second part of lemma pvcg 
s v i − v 
pvcg 
s v i v since s v i ≤ s v l − by the second 
part of lemma pvcg 
s v i v ≥ pvcg 
s v l − v 
therefore pvcg 
s v i − v pvcg 
s v l − v which yields bi v 
bl v therefore s b v i s b v l 
this completes the proof that s b v s v for all v ∈ v 
observe that for every player i such that s b v i ∈ k 
ps b v i b v pvcg 
s v i v 
therefore qi b v qvcg 
i v for every i ∈ n this shows 
that q b v qvcg 
 v for all v ∈ v hence ϕm 
 ϕvcg 
 
we proceed to prove that the t-strategy is an ex-post 
equilibrium note that by the truthfulness of vcg it is not 
beneficial for any player i to miss report her value to the 
mediator given that all other players use the t-strategy 
next we show that it is not beneficial for a single player i ∈ 
n to participate in the auction directly if all other players 
use the t-strategy fix some v ∈ v assume that player i 
is the only player that participates directly in the auction 
hence v−i is the vector of bids submitted by the mediator 
let bi be player i s bid let k s v i therefore since 
ϕm 
 ϕvcg 
 s b v i k let j be player i s position in the 
deviation hence j s v−i bi i if j ∈ k then player i s 
 
recall that s b i denotes the position of player i under the 
bid profile b and δ b j denotes the set of players assigned 
to position j whenever j ∈ k we slightly abuse notations 
and also refer to δ b j as the player that is assigned to 
position j 
 
utility is zero and therefore deviating is not worthwhile for 
i suppose j ∈ k then 
αk vi − pk b v αk vi − pvcg 
k v ≥ 
αj vi − pvcg 
j v−i bi ≥ αj vi − v j 
where the first equality follows from ϕm 
 ϕvcg 
 the first 
inequality follows since vcg is truthful and the second 
inequality follows from the first part of lemma since pj 
is position j s payment function in the next-price position 
auction αj vi − v j αj vi − pj v−i bi therefore 
αk vi − pk b v ≥ αj vi − pj v−i bi 
hence player i does not gain from participating directly in 
the auction 
finally we show that m is valid if all players choose 
the mediator then by the first part of lemma each player 
which uses the t-strategy will not pay more than his value 
consider the situation in which a subset of players s 
participate directly in the auction since the mediator submits 
the reported values on behalf of the other players these 
other players will not pay more than their reported values 
hence a player which used the t-strategy will not pay more 
than his value 
 mediators in generalized 
nextprice position auctions 
in the previous section we discussed the implementation 
of the vcg outcome function in the next price position 
auction in this section we deal with a more general family of 
position auctions in which the payment of each player who 
has been assigned a position is a function of the bids of 
players assigned to lower positions than his own the 
payment scheme p of such a position auction satisfies the 
following condition 
n for every j ∈ k and every b 
 b 
∈ b such that b 
 l 
b 
 l for every l j we have that pj b 
 pj b 
 
we next provide sufficient conditions for implementing the 
vcg outcome function by a valid mediator in position 
auctions whose payment schemes satisfy n 
we need the following notation and definition for every 
position auction g and every b ∈ b let ϕg 
 b s b q b 
we say that g is a v cg cover if for every v ∈ v there 
exists b ∈ b such that ϕg 
 b ϕvcg 
 v 
we say that g is monotone if pj b ≥ pj b for every 
j ∈ k and for every b ≥ b where b ≥ b if and only if 
bi ≥ bi for every i ∈ n 
we are now able to show 
theorem let g g α p be a position auction such 
that p satisfies n if the following conditions hold then 
there exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg 
in g 
 g is a v cg cover 
 g is monotone 
the proof of theorem is given in the full version we 
next provide the construction of the valid mediator which 
will implement the vcg outcome function in a position 
auction g which satisfies the conditions of theorem 
algorithm for building m for g 
 for every v ∈ v let mn v b v where b v is 
some bid profile such that ϕg

 for every i and for every v−i ∈ v−i let

remark as we wrote theorem applies in particular 
to next-price position auctions discussed in section 
however this theorem applies to many other interesting 
position auctions as will be shown later moreover the mediator 
constructed for this general case is different from the one in 
the proof of theorem 
we now show that condition n as well as the 
requirement that g is a v cg cover and the requirement that g 
is monotone are all necessary for establishing our result it 
is easy to see that if g is not a v cg cover then theorem 
 does not hold the following example shows the necessity 
of the monotonicity condition 
example let g g α p be the following position 
auction let n m α p b b − 
b and p b 
b b 
 
 and p b b notice that g 
is not monotone observe that condition n is satisfied in 
the full version we show that g is a v cg cover and it is 
not possible to implement the vcg outcome function in g 
with a valid mediator 
the next example shows that theorem does not hold 
when condition n is not satisfied 
example let g g α p be the following position 
auction let n k and α let 
p b 
b 
 
and p b b it is immediate to see that the 
monotonicity condition is satisfied we next show that g is 
a v cg cover let v ∈ v be an arbitrary valuation vector 
we need to find a bid profile b v such that ϕg 
 b v 
ϕvcg 
 v note that pvcg 
 v 
v v 
 
and pvcg 
 v v 
we define the bid profile b v as follows 
let bδ v v 
v 
 
 bδ v v v and bδ v v 
 v v 
by the construction of b v s b v i s v i for i 
 in addition observe that pj b v pvcg 
j v for 
j therefore ϕg 
 b v ϕvcg v since v is 
arbitrary g is a v cg cover 
naturally n is not satisfied suppose in negation that 
there exists a valid mediator m which implements the vcg 
outcome function in g consider the following vector of 
valuations v if all players use the mediator 
then player with valuation gets position pays and 
therefore her utility is − player can always bid 
more than the other players and by that cause some other 
player to be positioned second since the mediator is required 
to be valid it must be that the mediator submits not more 
than on behalf of both players and but then player 
 can bid and win the first position therefore player s 
utility will be − 
 
 this contradicts that m is a 
valid mediator that implements the vcg outcome function 
in g 
to summarize we have shown sufficient conditions for 
transforming a large class of position auctions to the v cg 
 
position auction by mediation moreover by dropping any 
of our conditions we get that such transformation might not 
be feasible 
in the next subsections we provide classes of interesting 
position auctions which can be transformed to the vcg 
position auction by mediation these auctions satisfy the 
conditions of theorem however in order to use theorem 
one has to check that a certain position auction g is a vcg 
cover in the full version paper before we apply this 
theorem we present another useful theorem that gives sufficient 
conditions guaranteeing that g is a vcg cover 
 generalized next-price position auctions 
in a generalized next-price auction the payment scheme is 
of the following form for every j ∈ k and for every b ∈ b 
pj b b l j where l j is an integer such that l j j 
 
we show 
proposition let g be a generalized next-price 
position auction there exists a valid mediator that implements 
ϕvcg 
in g if and only if the following two conditions hold 
 i l j l j for j m − and ii l m ≤ n 
 k-next-price position auctions 
in k-next-price position auctions the payment scheme is 
defined as follows for every j ∈ k and for every b pj b 
b j k k-next-price position auctions are in particular 
generalized next-price position auctions therefore proposition 
 yields as a corollary 
proposition let k ≥ let g be a k-next-price 
position auction there exists a valid mediator that implements 
ϕvcg 
in g if and only if n ≥ m k − 
 weighted next-price position auctions 
in weighted next-price position auctions the payment schemes 
are of the following form for every j ∈ k and for every 
b ∈ b pj b 
b j 
cj 
 where cj ≥ 
proposition let g be a weighted next-price position 
auction with the weights c c cm there exists a valid 
mediator that implements ϕvcg 
in g if and only if c ≥ · · · ≥ 
cm 
 google-like position auctions 
google-like ad auctions are slightly different from 
nextprice auction in these auctions the click-trough rate of an 
ad i in position j is the product of the quality of ad i 
βi and the position click-trough rate αj 
players 
are ranked in the positions by biβi 
let b ∈ b let ˜δ b j be defined as follows for every 
j ∈ k let ˜δ b j be the player i that obtains position j 
and for j m let ˜δ b j i where i obtained position m 
in case there is more than one player i such that bi b m 
then i is chosen between them via the breaking rule ˜γ 
if player i obtains position j ∈ k then she pays pj b 
β˜δ b j 
b˜δ b j 
βi 
 therefore player i s utility will be 
αjβi vi − 
b˜δ b j 
βi 
β˜δ b j αj viβi − b˜δ b j β˜δ b j 
 
recall that b j for every j n 
 
see e g 
hence by denoting ˜vi viβi for every i ∈ n and by 
applying theorem we obtain 
proposition there exists a valid mediator which 
implements the vcg outcome function in the google-like 
position auction 
 self-price position auctions 
let g be a self-price position auction as described at 
section at example we showed that when there is one 
position and two players the vcg outcome function is 
implemented by a valid mediator in this auction the proof 
in this example can be easily generalized to show that the 
vcg outcome function can be implemented by a valid 
mediator in a self-price position auction in which there is one 
position and an arbitrary number of players n ≥ 
next we show that it is impossible to implement the vcg 
outcome function even by a non-valid mediator in a 
selfprice position auction which has more than one position 
 m 
theorem let g be a self-price position auction with 
more than one position there is no mediator that 
implements the vcg outcome function in g 
proof let v ∈ v be the following valuation profile vn 
and v v · · · vn− the vcg outcome function 
assigns to this v an allocation in which player n receives 
position and player receives position the payments of 
players n and are both equal to in order to implement 
such an outcome a mediator must bid on behalf of player 
n so that this player pays and it must bid less than on 
behalf of any other player because otherwise another player 
receives position note that the bid of any other player 
cannot equal because every other player has an higher 
priority than n in particular even if player gets indeed 
position he will pay less than hence no mediator can 
implement the vcg outcome function in g 
the proof of theorem heavily uses the fixed priority 
rule assumption however as we have already said all our 
results including this theorem hold also for the tie breaking 
rule defined by the random priority rule the proof of the 
impossibility theorem for the random priority rule uses the 
fact that the particular bad priority rule used in the proof 
of theorem has a positive probability 
as we previously discussed the fixed and random 
priority rules are just convenient ways to model the first-arrival 
rule which is common in practice when one attempts to 
directly model position auctions that use the first-arrival 
rule without these modeling choices he tackles a lot of 
modeling problems in particular it is not clear how to model a 
position auction with the first-arrival rule as a game with 
incomplete information to do this one has to allow a player 
not only to submit a bid but also to decide about the time 
of the bid this raises a lot of additional modeling 
problems such as determining the relationship between the time 
a player decides to submit a bid and the time in which this 
bid is actually recorded hence efficient modeling as a game 
may be untractable nevertheless in the next section we 
will analyze mediators in position auctions which use the 
first-arrival rule we will define ex post equilibrium and the 
notion of implementation by mediation without explicitly 
modeling well-defined games we will show that in this case 
 
there is a way to implement the vcg outcome function in 
a self-price position auction moreover we will find a valid 
mediator that does the job 
 position auctions with the first 
arrival rule 
let g be a position auction with the first-arrival rule 
every mediator for g has the ability to determine the order 
in which the bids he submits on behalf of the players are 
recorded he can just submit the bids sequentially waiting 
for a confirmation before submitting the next bid we need 
the following notations 
every order of bidding can be described by some γ ∈ γ i 
bids before k if and only if γi γk hence an order of bids 
can serve as a priority rule for every order of bids γ and a 
vector of bids b we define s b γ i as the position assigned 
to i we denote the payment of i when the vector of bids 
is b and the order of bidding is γ by qi b γ ps b γ i b 
and we denote wi vi b γ the utility of i 
a mediator for g should determine the bids of the players 
who use its services and also the order of bids as a function 
of the reported types however all mediators discussed in 
this paper will use the same rule to determine the order of 
bids if all players report the vector of types ˆv the 
mediator uses the order of bids γˆv 
 which is defined as follows 
γˆv 
i γˆv 
k if and only if ˆvi ˆvk or ˆvi ˆvk and i k for 
example if n and the reported types are ˆv 
then γˆv 
 if only a strict subset of the players 
use the mediator s services the mediator applies the same 
order of bids rule to this subset a mediator for a position 
auction with the first arrival rule is therefore defined by a 
vector m ms s⊆n however such a mediator is called 
a directed mediator in order to stress the fact that it 
determines not only the bids but also the order of bids to 
summarize if all players use the directed mediator m and 
the reported bids are ˆv then the directed mediator bids 
mn ˆv i on behalf of i i receives the position s ˆv γˆv 
 i 
and pays qi mn ˆv γˆv 
 if only the subset s uses the 
mediator s services the reported types are ˆvs and the other 
players bid directly b−s then the actual order of bids is not 
uniquely determined if this order is γ then the position 
of i ∈ n is s b γ i and its payment is qi b γ where 
b ms ˆvs b−s in particular if every player is using 
the t-strategy and the players profile of types is v then 
the outcome generated by the directed mediator is 
ψm 
 v s v γv 
 q mn v γv 
 
but why should the players use the t strategy assume all 
players but i use the t strategy if player i deviates from the 
t strategy by reporting a false type to the directed mediator 
the resulting outcome is well-defined on the other hand 
when this player sends a bid directly to the auctioneer the 
resulting outcome is not clear because the order of bids is 
not clear 
a good desired directed mediator would be one that no 
player would want to deviate from the t strategy 
independently of the order in which the bids are recorded because 
of his deviation more specifically 
definition let g be a position auction with the 
firstarrival rule and let m be a directed mediator for g the 
 
it is clear however that the resulting order γ is consistent 
with the well-defined order of bids of n \ i 
t-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium with respect to 
m if for every player i and type vi and for every vector of 
types of the other players v−i the following two conditions 
hold 
f i is not better off when he gives the directed mediator 
the right of play and reports a false type that is for every 
ˆvi ∈ vi 
wi vi mn vi v−i γ vi v−i 
 ≥ wi vi mn ˆvi v−i γ ˆvi v−i 
 
f i is not better off when he bids directly independently 
of the resulting order of recorded bids that is for every 
bi ∈ bi and for every γ ∈ γ which is consistent with the 
order of bids of members of n \ i resulting from the vector 
of types v−i 
wi vi mn vi v−i γ vi v−i 
 ≥ wi vi bi mn\i v−i γ 
the notion of valid directed mediators is analogously 
defined 
definition let g be a position auction with the 
firstarrival rule a directed mediator for g is valid if for every 
player using the t-strategy guarantees a non-negative level 
of utility 
formally a directed mediator m for g is valid if for every 
player i with type vi for every subset s ⊆ n such that i ∈ s 
for every vs\i and for every b−s wi vi ms vs b−s γ ≥ 
 for every γ ∈ γ which is consistent with the standard 
order of bids of s determined by the mediator when the 
reported types are vs 
the notion of implementation by mediation remains as 
before the directed mediator m implements the vcg 
outcome function in g if ψm 
 ϕvcg 
 
our previous results remain true for directed mediators for 
position auctions with the first arrival rule next we show 
that in contrast to theorem it is possible to implement the 
vcg outcome function in every self-price position auction 
with the first-arrival rule 
theorem let g g α p be the self-price position 
auction with the first arrival rule there exists a valid 
directed mediator that implements the vcg outcome function 
in g 
in the following theorem we provide sufficient conditions 
for implementing that the vcg outcome function in a 
position auction with the first-arrival rule a special 
characteristic of auctions satisfying these sufficient conditions is 
that players payments may depend also on their own bid 
in contrast to the auctions discussed in theorem the long 
proof of this theorem is in the spirit of all previous proofs 
and therefore it is omitted 
theorem let g g α p be a position auction with 
the first-arrival rule if the following conditions hold then 
there exists a valid directed mediator for g that implements 
the vcg outcome function in g 
 for every v ∈ v there exists b ∈ b such that pj b 
v j for every j ∈ k 
 g is monotone 
 pj b ≥ pj b for every j ∈ k and every b ∈ b 
 for every j ∈ k and every b 
 b 
∈ b such that b 
 l 
b 
 l for every l ≥ j pj b 
 pj b
