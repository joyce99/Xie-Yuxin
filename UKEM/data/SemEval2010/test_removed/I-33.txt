abstract 
up to now the way institutions and organizations have been used in 
the development of open systems has not often gone further than a 
useful heuristics in order to develop systems actually 
implementing institutions and organizations formal methods should take the 
place of heuristic ones the paper presents a formal semantics for 
the notion of institution and its components abstract and concrete 
norms empowerment of agents roles and defines a formal 
relation between institutions and organizational structures as a result 
it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to 
constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented 
system it is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully 
formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification

 introduction 
the opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of 
organizational and social theory to distributed ai and multiagent 
systems mass has long been advocated in mass the 
application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system 
design has proven to be useful for the development of 
methodologies and tools in many cases however the application of these 
conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high 
level design of the systems it is our thesis that the application of 
those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are 
treated formally that is once notions such as norm role structure 
etc obtain a formal semantics this has been the case for agent 
programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from 
folk psychology belief intention desire knowledge etc have 
been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as 
for instance bdictl and karo as a matter of 
fact those theories have fostered the production of architectures 
and programming languages 
what is lacking at the moment for the design and development of 
open mass is in our opinion something that can play the role that 
bdi-like formalisms have played for the design and development 
of single-agent architectures aim of the present paper is to fill this 
gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal 
foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its 
relation to the organizational one the main result of the paper 
consists in showing how abstract constraints institutions can be step 
by step refined to concrete structural descriptions organizational 
structures of the to-be-implemented system bridging thus the gap 
between abstract norms and concrete system specifications 
concretely in section a logical framework is presented which 
provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution norm 
role and which supports the account of key features of institutions 
such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and 
implementable ones the institutional empowerment of agents and some 
aspects of the design of norm enforcement in section the 
framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an 
institution the extended framework is then studied in relation to 
the formalism for representing organizational structures presented 
in in section some conclusions follow 
 institutions 
social theory usually thinks of institutions as the rules of the 
game from an agent perspective institutions are to 
paraphrase this quote the rules of the various games agents can 
play in order to interact with one another to assume an 
institutional perspective on mass means therefore to think of mass in 
normative terms 
 law computer systems and many other kinds of 
organizational structure may be viewed as instances of 
normative systems we use the term to refer to any set 
of interacting agents whose behavior can usefully be 
regarded as governed by norms p 
the normative system perspective on institutions is as such 
nothing original and it is already a quite acknowledged position within 
the community working on electronic institutions or einstitutions 
 what has not been sufficiently investigated and understood 
with formal methods is in our view the question what does it 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
amount to for a mas to be put under a set of norms or in other 
words what does it mean for a designer of an einstitution to state 
a set of norms we advance a precise thesis on this issue which is 
also inspired by work in social theory 
now as the original manner of producing physical 
entities is creation there is hardly a better way to 
describe the production of moral entities than by the word 
 imposition impositio for moral entities do not arise 
from the intrinsic substantial principles of things but 
are superadded to things already existent and 
physically complete pp - 
by ignoring for a second the philosophical jargon of the 
seventeenth century we can easily extract an illuminating message from 
the excerpt what institutions do is to impose properties on already 
existing entities that is to say institutions provide descriptions of 
entities by making use of conceptualizations that are not proper of 
the common descriptions of those entities for example that cars 
have wheels is a common factual property whereas the fact that 
cars count as vehicles in some technical legal sense is a property 
that law imposes on the concept car to say it with the 
fact that cars have wheels is a brute fact while the fact that cars 
are vehicles is an institutional fact institutions build structured 
descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a 
given domain 
at this point the step toward einstitutions is natural 
einstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a mas they 
specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r what are 
the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the 
institution etc they do this via linking some institutional properties 
of the possible states and transitions of the system e g agent i 
enacts role r to some brute properties of those states and transitions 
 e g agent i performs protocol no an institutional property 
is therefore a property of system states or system transitions i e 
a state type or a transition type that does not belong to a merely 
technical or factual description of the system 
to sum up institution are viewed as sets of norms normative 
system perspective and norms are thought of as the imposition 
of an institutional description of the system upon its description in 
terms of brute properties in a nutshell institutions are impositions 
of institutional terminologies upon brute ones the following 
sections provide a formal analysis of this thesis and show its 
explanatory power in delivering a rigorous understanding of key features 
of institutions because of its suitability for representing complex 
domain descriptions the formal framework we will make use of 
is the one of description logics dl the use of such formalism 
will also stress the idea of viewing institutions as the impositions 
of domain descriptions 
 preliminaries a very expressive dl 
the description logic language enabling the necessary 
expressivity expands the standard description logic language alc 
with relational operators ◦ ¬ id to express complex transition 
types and relational hierarchies h to express inclusion between 
transition types following a notational convention common within 
dl we denote this language with alch ◦ ¬ id 
 
definition syntax of alch ◦ ¬ id 
 
transition types and state type constructs are defined by the 
following bnf 
α a α ◦ α α α ¬α id γ 
γ c ⊥ ¬γ γ γ ∀α γ 
where a and c are atomic transition types and respectively atomic 
state types 
it is worth providing the intuitive reading of a couple of the 
operators and the constructs just introduced in particular ∀α γ has to 
be read as after all executions of transitions of type α states of 
type γ are reached the operator ◦ denotes the concatenation of 
transition types the operator id applies to a state description γ 
and yields a transition description namely the transition ending in 
γ states it is the description logic variant of the test operator in 
dynamic logic notice that we use the same symbols and 
¬ for denoting the boolean operators of disjunction and negation 
of both state and transition types atomic state types c are often 
indexed by an agent identifier i in order to express agent properties 
 e g dutch i and atomic transition types a are often indexed by 
a pair of agent identifiers i j e g pay i j denoting the 
actor and respectively the recipient of the transition by removing 
the agent identifiers from state types and transition types we 
obtain state type forms e g dutch or rea r and transition type form 
 e g pay 
a terminological box henceforth tbox t γ a consists of 
a finite set γ of state type inclusion assertions γ γ and of a 
finite set a of transition type inclusion assertions α α 
the semantics of alch ◦ ¬ id 
is model theoretical and it is 
given in terms of interpreted transition systems as usual state 
types are interpreted as sets of states and transition types as sets of 
state pairs 
definition semantics of alch ◦ ¬ id 
 
an interpreted transition system m for alch ◦ ¬ id 
is a 
structure s i where s is a non-empty set of states and i is a function 
such that 
i c ⊆ s i a ⊆ s × s 
i ⊥ ∅ i ¬γ δm\ i γ 
i γ γ i γ ∩ i γ 
i ∀α γ s ∈ s ∀t s t ∈ i α ⇒ t ∈ i γ 
i α α i α ∪ i α 
i ¬α s × s \ i α 
i α ◦ α s s ∃s s s ∈ i α s s ∈ i α 
i id γ s s s ∈ i γ 
an interpreted transition system m is a model of a state type 
inclusion assertion γ γ if i γ ⊆ i γ it is a model of a 
transition type inclusion assertion α α if i α ⊆ i α an 
interpreted transition system m is a model of a tbox t γ a 
if m is a model of each inclusion assertion in γ and a 
remark derived constructs the correspondence between 
description logic and dynamic logic is well-known in fact the 
language presented in definitions and is a notational variant of 
the language of dynamic logic without the iteration operator 
of transition types as a consequence some key constructs are still 
definable in alch ◦ ¬ id 
 in particular we will make use of the 
following definition of the if-then-else transition type 
if γ then α else α id γ ◦ α id ¬γ ◦ α 
boolean operators are defined as usual 
we will come back to some complexity features of this logic in 
section 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 institutions as terminologies 
we have upheld that institutions impose new system 
descriptions which are formulated in terms of sets of norms the step 
toward a formal grounding of this view of institutions is now short 
norms can be thought of as terminological axioms and institutions 
as sets of terminological axioms i e terminological boxes 
an institution can be specified as a terminological box ins 
γins ains where each inclusion statement in γins and ains 
models a norm of the institution obviously not every tbox can 
be considered to be an institution specification in particular an 
institution specification ins must have some precise linguistic 
relationship with the  brute descriptions upon which the institution is 
specified we denote by lins the non-logical alphabet containing 
only institutional state and transition types and by lbrute the 
nonlogical alphabet containing those types taken to talk about instead 
 brute states and transitions 
 
definition institutions as tboxes 
a tbox ins γins ains is an institution specification if 
 the non-logical alphabet on which ins is specified contains 
elements of both lins and lbrute in symbols l ins ⊆ 
lins ∪ lbrute 
 there exist sets of terminological axioms γbridge ⊆ γins 
and abridge ⊆ ains such that either the left-hand side of 
these axioms is always a description expressed in lbrute and 
the right-hand side a description expressed in lins or those 
axioms are definitions in symbols if γ γ ∈ γbridge 
then either γ ∈ lbrute and γ ∈ lins or it is the case 
that also γ γ ∈ γbridge the clause for abridge is 
analogous 
 the remaining sets of terminological axioms γins\γbridge 
and ains\abridge are all expressed in lins in symbols 
l γins\γbridge ⊆ lins and l ains\abridge ⊆ lins 
the definition states that an institution specification needs to be 
expressed on a language including institutional as well as brute terms 
 that a part of the specification concerns a description of mere 
institutional terms and that there needs to be a part of the 
specification which connects institutional terms to brute ones 
terminological axioms in γbridge and abridge formalize in dl the 
searlean notion of counts-as conditional that is rules 
stating what kind of meaning an institution gives to certain brute facts 
and transitions e g checking box no in form no counts as 
accepting your personal data to be used for research purposes a 
formal theory of counts-as statements has been thoroughly 
developed in a series of papers among which the technical 
content of the present paper heavily capitalizes on that work 
notice also that given the semantics presented in definition 
if institutions can be specified via tboxes then the meaning of 
such specifications is a set of interpreted transition systems i e 
the models of those tboxes these transitions systems can be in 
turn thought of as all the possible mass which model the specified 
institution 
remark lbrute from a designer s perspective from a 
design perspective language lbrute has to be thought of as the 
language on which a designer would specify a system instantiating a 
given institution 
 definition shows that for such a design task 
 
symbols from lins and lbrute will be indexed especially with 
agent identifiers to add some syntactic sugar 
 
to make a concrete example the ameli middleware can be 
viewed as a specification tool at a lbrute level 
it is needed to formally specify an explicit bridge between the 
concepts used in the description of the actual system and the 
institutional  abstract concepts we will come back to this issue in 
section 
 from abstract to concrete norms 
to illustrate definition and show its explanatory power an 
example follows which depicts an essential phenomenon of 
institutions 
example from abstract to concrete norms consider an 
institution supposed to regulate access to a set of public web 
services it may contain the following norm it is forbidden to 
discriminate access on the basis of citizenship suppose now a 
system has to be built which complies with this norm the first question 
is what does it mean in concrete to discriminate on the basis 
of citizenship the system designer should make some concrete 
choices for interpreting the norm and these choices should be kept 
track of in order to explicitly link the abstract norm to its concrete 
interpretation the problem can be represented as follows the 
abstract norm is formalized by formula by making use of a 
standard reduction technique of deontic notions see the 
statement it is forbidden to discriminate on the basis of citizenship 
amounts to the statement after every execution of a transition of 
type discr i j the system always ends up in a violation state 
together with the norm also some intuitive background knowledge 
about the discrimination action needs to be formalized here as 
well as in the rest of the examples in the paper we provide just that 
part of the formalization which is strictly functional to show how 
the formalism works in practice formulae and express two 
effect laws if the requester j is dutch then after all executions of 
transitions of type discr i j j is accepted by i whereas if it is 
not all the executions of the transitions of the same type have as 
an effect that it is not accepted all formulae have to be read as 
schemata determining a finite number of subsumption expressions 
depending on the number of agents i j considered 
∀discr i j viol ≡ 
dutch j ∀discr i j accepted j 
¬dutch j ∀discr i j ¬accepted j 
the rest of the axioms concern the translation of the abstract type 
discr i j to concrete transition types formula refines it by 
making explicit that a precise if-then-else procedure counts as a 
discriminatory act of agent i formulae and specify which 
messages of i to j count as acceptance and rejection if the designer 
uses transition types send msg i j and send msg i j for 
the concrete system specification then formulae and can be 
thought of as bridge axioms connecting notions belonging to the 
institutional alphabet to accept and to reject to concrete ones to 
send specific messages finally formulae and state two 
intuitive effect laws concerning the accept i j and reject i j 
types 
if dutch j then accept i j 
else reject i j discr i j 
send msg i j accept i j 
send msg i j reject i j 
∀accept i j accepted j ≡ 
∀reject i j ¬accepted j ≡ 
it is easy to see on the grounds of the semantics exposed in 
definition that the following concrete inclusion statement holds w r t 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the specified institution 
if dutch j then send msg i j 
else send msg i j discr i j 
this scenario exemplifies a pervasive feature of human institutions 
which as extensively argued in should be incorporated by 
electronic ones current formal approaches to institutions such as 
islander do not allow for the formal specification of 
explicit translations of abstract norms into concrete ones and focus 
only on norms that can be specified at the concrete system 
specification level what example shows is that the problem of the 
abstractness of norms in institutions can be formally addressed and 
can be given a precise formal semantics 
the scenario suggests that just by modifying an appropriate set 
of terminological axioms it is possible for the designer to obtain 
a different institution by just modifying the sets of bridge axioms 
without touching the terminological axioms expressed only in the 
institutional language lins in fact it is the case that a same set of 
abstract norms can be translated to different and even incompatible 
sets of concrete norms this translation can nevertheless not be 
arbitrary 
example acceptable and unacceptable translations of 
abstract norms reconsider again the scenario sketched in example 
 the transition type discr i j has been translated to a 
complex procedure composed by concrete transition types would any 
translation do consider an alternative institution specification 
ins containing formulae - and the following translation rule 
pay j i e discr i j 
would this formula be an acceptable translation of the abstract 
norm expressed in formula the axiom states that transitions 
where i receives e from j count as transitions of type discr i j 
needless to say this is not intuitive because the abstract transition 
type discr i j obeys some intuitive conceptual constraints 
 formulae and that all its translations should also obey in fact 
the following inclusions would then hold in ins 
dutch j ∀pay j i e accepted j 
¬dutch j ∀pay j i e ¬accepted j 
in fact there properties of the transition type pay j i e look 
at least awkward if an agent is dutch than by paying e it would 
be accepted while if it was not dutch the same action would make 
it not accepted the problem is that the meaning of  paying is not 
intuitively subsumed by the meaning of  discriminating in other 
words a transition type pay j i e does not intuitively yield the 
effects that a sub-type of discr i j yields it is on the contrary 
perfectly intuitive that formula obeys the constraints in formulae 
 and which it does as it can be easily checked on the grounds 
of the semantics 
it is worth stressing that without providing a model-theoretic 
semantics for the translation rules linking the institutional notions to 
the brute ones it would not be so straightforward to model the 
logical constraints to which the translations are subjected example 
this is precisely the advantage of viewing translation rules as 
specific terminological axioms i e γbridge and abridge working as a 
bridge between two languages definition in we have 
thoroughly compared this approach with approaches such as which 
conceive of translation rules as inference rules 
the two examples have shown how our approach can account for 
some essential features of institutions in the next section the same 
framework is applied to provide a formal analysis of the notion of 
role 
 institutional modules and roles 
viewing institutions as the impositions of institutional 
descriptions on systems states and transitions allows for analyzing the 
normative system perspective itself i e institutions are sets of 
norms at a finer granularity we have seen that the terminological 
axioms specifying an institution concern complex descriptions of 
new institutional notions some of the institutional state types 
occurring in the institution specification play a key role in structuring 
the specification of the institution itself the paradigmatic example 
in this sense are facts such as agent i enacts role r which 
will be denoted by state types rea i r by stating how an agent 
can enact and  deact a role r and what normative consequences 
follow from the enactment of r an institution describes expected 
forms of agents behavior while at the same time abstracting from 
the concrete agents taking part to the system 
the sets of norms specifying an institution can be clustered on 
the grounds of the rea state types for each relevant institutional 
state type e g rea i r the terminological axioms which define 
an institution i e its norms can be clustered in possibly 
overlapping sets of three different types the axioms specifying how states 
of that institutional type can be reached e g how an agent i can 
enact the role r how states of that type can be left e g how an 
agent i can  deact the a role r and what kind of institutional 
consequences do those states bear e g what rights and power does 
agent i acquire by enacting role r borrowing the terminology 
from work in legal and institutional theory these clusters 
of norms can be called respectively institutive terminative and 
status modules 
status modules we call status modules those sets of 
terminological axioms which specify the institutional consequences of the 
occurrence of a given institutional state-of-affairs for instance the 
fact that agent i enacts role r 
example a status module for roles enacting a role within 
an institution bears some institutional consequences that are grouped 
under the notion of status by playing a role an agent acquires a 
specific status some of these consequences are deontic and 
concern the obligations rights permissions under which the agent puts 
itself once it enacts the role an example which pertains to the 
normative description of the status of both a buyer and a seller 
roles is the following 
rea i buyer rea j seller win bid i j b 
∀¬pay i j b viol i 
if agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role and i wins 
bid b then if i does not perform a transition of type pay i j b 
i e does not pay to j the price corresponding to bid b then the 
system ends up in a state that the institution classifies as a violation 
state with i being the violator notice that formula formalizes 
at the same time an obligation pertaining to the role buyer and 
a right pertaining to the role seller of particular interest are 
then those consequences that attribute powers to agents enacting 
specific roles 
rea i buyer rea j seller ∀bid i j b bid i j b 
send i j msg bid i j b 
if agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role every time 
agent i bids b to j this action results in an institutional state 
testifying that the corresponding bid has been placed by i formula 
 formula states how the bidding action can be executed by 
sending a specific message to j send i j msg 
some observations are in order as readers acquainted with 
deontic logic have probably already noticed our treatment of the notion 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
of obligation formula makes again use of a standard 
reduction approach more interesting is instead how the notion 
of institutional power is modeled essentially the empowerment 
phenomenon is analyzed in term of two rules one specifying the 
institutional effects of an institutional action formula and one 
translating the institutional transition type in a brute one formula 
 systems of rules of this type empower the agents enacting 
some relevant role by establishing a connection between the brute 
actions of the agents and some institutional effect whether the 
agents are actually able to execute the required  brute actions is 
a different issue since agent i can be in some states or even all 
states unable to effectuate a send i j msg transition this 
is the case also in human societies priests are empowered to give 
rise to marriages but if a priest is not in state of performing the 
required speech acts he is actually unable to marry anybody there is 
a difference between being entitled to make a bid and being in 
state of making a bid in other words formulae and 
express only that agents playing the buyer role are entitled to make 
bids the actual possibility of performing the required  brute 
actions is not an institutional issue but rather an issue concerning the 
implementation of an institution in a concrete system we address 
this issue extensively in section 
 
institutive modules we call institutive modules those sets of 
terminological axioms of an institution specification describing how 
states with certain institutional properties can be reached for 
instance how an agent i can reach a state in which it enacts role r 
they can be seen as procedures that the institution define in order 
for the agents to bring institutional states of affairs about 
example an institutive module for roles the fact that an 
agent i enacts a role r rea i r is the effect of a corresponding 
enactment action enact i r performed under certain 
circumstances formula namely that the agent does not already enact 
the role and that the agent satisfies given conditions cond i r 
which might for instance pertain the computational capabilities 
required for an agent to play the chosen role or its capability 
to interact with some specific system s infrastructures formula 
 specifies instead the procedure counting as an action of type 
enact i r such a procedure is performed through a system 
infrastructure s which notifies to i that it has been registered as 
enacting role r after sending the necessary piece of data d send i s 
d e g a valid credit card number 
¬rea i r cond i r enact i r rea i r 
send i s d ◦ notify s i enact i r 
terminative modules analogously we call terminative 
modules those sets of terminological axioms stating how a state with 
certain institutional properties can be left rules of this kind state 
for instance how an agent can stop enacting a certain role they 
can be thus thought of as procedures that the institution defines in 
order for the agent to see to it that certain institutional states stop 
holding 
example a terminative module for roles terminative 
modules for roles specify for instance how a transition type deact i r 
can be executed which has as consequence the reaching of a state 
of type ¬rea i r 
rea i r deact i r ¬rea i r 
send i s msg deact i r 
that is to say i deacting a role r always leads to a state where 
 
see in particular example and definition 
i does not enact role r and i sending message no to a specific 
interface infrastructure s count as i deacting role r 
examples - have shown how roles can be formalized in our 
framework thereby getting a formal semantics roles are also sets of 
terminological axioms concerning state types of the sort rea i r 
it is worth noticing that this modeling option is aligned with work 
on social theory addressing the concept of role such as 
 tractable specifications of institutions 
in the previous sections we fully deployed the expressivity of 
the language introduced in section and used its semantics to 
provide a formal understanding of many essential aspects of 
institutions in terms of transition systems this section spends a few 
words about the viability of performing automated reasoning in the 
logic presented the satisfiability problem 
in logic alch ◦ ¬ id 
is undecidable since transition type inclusion axioms correspond to 
a version of what in description logic are known as role-value 
maps and logics extending alc with role-value maps are known 
to be undecidable 
tractable i e polynomial time decidable fragments of logic 
alch ◦ ¬ id 
can however be isolated which still exhibit some 
key expressive features one of them is logic elh ◦ 
 it is 
obtained from description logic el which contains only state types 
intersection existential restriction ∃ and 
 but extended with 
the ⊥ state type and with transition type inclusion axioms of a 
complex form a ◦ ◦an a with n finite number logic elh ◦ 
is also a fragment of the well investigated description logic el 
whose satisfiability problem has been shown in to be decidable 
in polynomial time despite the very limited expressivity of this 
fragment some rudimentary institutional specifications can still be 
successfully represented specifically institutive and terminative 
modules can be represented which contain transition types 
inclusion axioms restricted versions of status modules can also be 
represented enabling two essential deontic notions it is possible 
 respectively impossible to reach a violation state by performing a 
transition of a certain type and it is possible respectively 
impossible to reach a legal state by performing a transition of a certain 
type to this aim language lins would need to be expanded with 
a set of state types legal i ≤i≤n whose intuitive meaning is to 
denote legal states as opposed to states of type viol i 
fragments like elh ◦ 
could be used as target logics within 
theory approximation approaches by aiming at compiling 
tboxes expressed in alch ◦ ¬ id 
into approximations in those 
fragments 
 from norms to structures 
 infrastructures 
in discussing example we observed how being entitled to 
make a bid does not imply being in state of making a bid in 
other words an institution can empower agents by means of 
appropriate rules but this empowerment can remain dead letter similar 
 
this problem amounts to check whether a state description γ 
is satisfiable w r t a given tbox t i e to check if there 
exists a model m of t such that ∅ ⊂ i γ notice that language 
alch ◦ ¬ id 
contains negation and intersection of arbitrary 
state types it is well-known that if these operators are available 
then all most typical reasoning tasks at the tbox level can be 
reduced to the satisfiability problem 
 
notice therefore that el is a seriously restricted fragment of alc 
since it does not contain the negation operator for state types 
 operators and ∀ remain thus undefinable 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
observations apply also to deontic notions agents might be allowed 
to perform certain transactions under some relevant conditions but 
they might be unable to do so under those same conditions we 
refer to this kind of problems as infrastructural the implementation 
of an institution in a concrete system calls therefore for the design 
of appropriate infrastructures or artifacts the formal 
specification of an infrastructure amounts to the formal specification of 
interaction requirements that is to say the specification of which 
relevant transition types are executable and under what conditions 
definition infrastructures as tboxes 
an infrastructure inf γinf ainf for institution ins is a tbox 
on lbrute such that for all a ∈ l abridge there exist 
terminological axioms in γinf of the following form γ ≡ ∃a a is 
executable exactly in γ states and γ ≡ ∃¬a the negation of a 
is executable exactly in γ states 
in other words an infrastructure specification states all and only 
the conditions under which an atomic brute transition type and its 
negation are executable which occur in the brute alphabet of the 
bridge axioms of ins it states what can be in concrete done and 
under what conditions 
example infrastructure specification consider the 
institution specified in example a simple infrastructure inf for that 
institution could contain for instance the following terminological 
axioms for any pair of different agents i j and message type msg 
∃send msg i j 
the formula states that it is always in the possibilities of agent i to 
send message no to agent j it then follows on the grounds of 
example that agent i can always accept agent j 
∃accept i j 
notice that the executability condition is just 
we call a concrete institution specification cins an institution 
specification ins coupled with an infrastructure specification inf 
definition concrete institution 
a concrete institution obtained by joining the institution ins 
γins ains and the infrastructure inf γinf ainf is a tbox 
cins γ a such that γ γins ∪ γinf and a ains ∪ ainf 
obviously different infrastructures can be devised for a same 
institution giving rise to different concrete institutions which makes 
precise implementation choices explicit of particular relevance 
are the implementation choices concerning abstract norms like the 
one represented in formula a designer can choose to regiment 
such norm i e make violation states unreachable via an 
appropriate infrastructure 
example regimentation via infrastructure specification 
consider example and suppose the following translation rule to 
be also part of the institution 
bnk i j b cc i j b ≡ pay i j b 
condition pay i j b ≡ rea i buyer 
rea j seller win bid i j b 
the first formula states how the payment can be concretely carried 
out via bank transfer or credit card and the second just provides 
a concrete label grouping the institutional state types relevant for 
the norm in order to specify a regimentation at the infrastructural 
level it is enough to state that 
condition pay i j b ≡ ∃ bnk i j b cc i j b 
¬condition pay i j b ≡ ∃¬ bnk i j b cc i j b 
in other words in states of type condition pay i j b the only 
executable brute actions are bank i j b or cc i j b and 
therefore pay i j b would necessarily be executed as a result the 
following inclusion does not hold with respect to the corresponding 
concrete institution condition pay i j b ∃¬pay i viol i 
 organizational structures 
this section briefly summarizes and adapts the perspective and 
results on organizational structures presented in we refer 
to that work for a more comprehensive exposition 
organizational structures typically concern the way agents 
interact within organizations these interactions can be depicted as the 
links of a graph defined on the set of roles of the organization such 
links are then to be labeled on the basis of the type of interaction 
they stand for first of all it should be clear whether a link 
denotes that a certain interaction between two roles can or ought to 
or may etc take place secondly links should be labeled according 
to the transition type α they refer to and the conditions γ in which 
that transition can ought to may etc take place links in a 
formal specification of an organizational structure stand therefore for 
statements of the kind role r can ought to may execute α w r t 
role s if γ is the case for the sake of simplicity the following 
definition will consider only the can and ought-to interaction 
modalities state and transition types in lins ∪lbrute will be used 
to label the links of the structure interaction modalities can 
therefore be of an institutional kind or of a brute kind 
definition organizational structure 
an organizational structure is a multi-graph 
os roles cp p∈mod op p∈mod 
where 
 mod denotes a set of pairs p γ α that is a set of 
state type condition and transition type action pairs of 
lins∪lbrute with α being an atomic transition-type indexed 
with a pair i j denoting placeholders for the actor and the 
recipient of the transition 
 c can denotes links to be interpreted in terms of the 
executability of the related α in γ whereas o ought denotes 
links to be interpreted in terms of the obligation to execute 
the related α in γ 
by the expressions r s ∈ cγ α and r s ∈ oγ α we mean 
therefore agents enacting role r can and respectively ought to interact 
with agents enacting role s by performing α in states of type γ 
as shown in such formal representations of organizational 
structures are of use for investigating the structural properties 
 robustness flexibility etc that a given organization exhibits 
at this point all the formal means are put in place which allow 
us to formally represent institutions as well as organizational 
structures the next and final step of the work consists in providing 
a formal relation between the two frameworks this formal 
relation will make explicit how institutions are related to organizational 
structures and vice versa in particular it will become clear how a 
normative conception of the notion of role relates to a structural 
one that is how the view of roles as a sets of norms specifying 
how an agent can enact and deact the role and what social status 
it obtains by doing that relates to the view of roles as positions 
within social structures 
 relating institutions to organizations 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
to translate a given concrete institution into a corresponding 
organizational structure we need a function t assigning pairs of roles 
to axioms let us denote with sub the set of all state type inclusion 
statements γ γ that can be expressed on lins ∪ lbrute 
function t is a partial function sub roles × roles such that for 
any x ∈ sub if x rea i r rea j s γ ∃α 
 executability or x rea i r rea j s γ ∀¬α viol i obligation 
then t x r s where α is an atomic transition-type indexed 
with a pair i j that is to say executability and obligation laws 
containing the enactment configuration rea i r rea j s as a 
premise and concerning transition of types α with i actor and j 
recipient of the α transition are translated into role pairs r s 
definition correspondence of specifications 
a concrete institution cins γ a is said to correspond to an 
organizational structure os and vice versa if for every x ∈ γ 
 x rea i r rea j s γ ∃α iff t x ∈ cγ α 
 x rea i r rea j s γ ∀¬α viol i iff t x ∈ oγ α 
intuitively function t takes axioms from γ i e the set of state type 
terminological axioms of cins and yields pairs of roles 
definition labels the yielded pairs accordingly to the syntactic form 
of the translated axioms more concretely axioms of the form 
rea i r rea j s γ ∃α executability laws are 
translated into the pair r s belonging to the executability dimension 
 i e c of the organizational structure w r t the execution of α 
under circumstances γ analogously axioms of the form rea i r 
rea j s γ ∀¬α viol i obligation laws are translated into 
the pair r s belonging to the obligation dimension i e o of 
the organizational structure w r t the execution of α under 
circumstances γ leaving technicalities aside function t distills thus the 
terminological and infrastructural constraints of cins into 
structural ones the institutive terminative and status modules of roles 
are translated into definitions of positions within a os 
from a design perspective the interpretation of definition is 
twofold on the one hand from left to right it can make 
explicit what the structural consequences are of a given institution 
supported by a given infrastructure on the other hand from right 
to left it can make explicit what kind of institution is actually 
implemented by a given organizational structure let us see this in 
some more details 
given a concrete institution cins definition allows a designer 
to be aware of the impact that specific terminological choices in 
particular the choice of certain bridge axioms and infrastructural 
ones have at a structural level notice that definition supports the 
inference of links in a structure by checking whether a given 
inclusion statement of the relevant syntactic form follows from cins 
 i e the so-called subsumption problem of dl it is possible via 
t to add new links to the corresponding organizational structure 
this can be recursively done by just adding any new inferred 
inclusion x to the previous set of axioms γ thus obtaining an 
updated institutional specification containing γ ∪ x this process 
can be thought of as the inference of structural links from 
institutional specifications in other words it is possible to use institution 
specifications as inference tools for structural specifications for 
instance the infrastructural choice formalized in example 
implies that for the pair of roles buyer seller it is always the case 
that buyer seller ∈ c pay i j b this link follows from links 
 buyer seller ∈ c bnk i j b and buyer seller ∈ c cc i j b 
on the grounds of the bridge axioms of the institution formula 
suppose now a designer to be interested in a system which 
besides implementing an institution also incorporates an 
organizational structure enjoying desirable structural properties such as 
flexibility or robustness 
 by relating structural links to state type 
inclusions it is therefore possible to check whether adding a link in 
os results in a stronger institutional specification that is if the 
corresponding inclusion statement is not already implied by ins 
to draw a parallelism with what just said in the previous 
paragraph this process can be thought of as the inference of norms and 
infrastructural constraints from the specification of organizational 
structures to give a simple example consider again example but 
from a reversed perspective suppose a designer wants a fully 
connected graph in the dimension c send i j 
of the organizational 
structure exploiting definition we would obtain a number of 
executability laws in the fashion of formula for all roles in roles 
 thus roles 
axioms 
definition establishes a correspondence between two 
essentially different perspectives on the design of open systems allowing 
for feedbacks between the two to be formally analyzed one last 
observation is in order while given a concrete institution an 
organizational structure can be in principle fully specified by 
checking for all -finitely many- relevant inclusion statements whether 
they are implied or not by the institution it is not possible to 
obtain a full terminological specification from an organizational 
structure this lies on the fact that in definition the strictly 
terminological information contained in the specification of an institution 
 eminently the set of transition type axioms a and therefore the 
bridge axioms is lost while moving to a structural description this 
shows in turn that the added value of the specification of 
institutions lies precisely in the terminological link they establish between 
institutional and brute i e system level notions 
 conclusions 
the paper aimed at providing a comprehensive formal 
analysis of the institutional metaphor and its relation to the 
organizational one the predominant formal tool has been description logic 
tboxes has been used to represent the specifications of 
institutions definition and their infrastructures definition 
providing therefore a transition system semantics for a number of 
institutional notions examples - multi-graphs has then been used to 
represent the specification of organizational structures definition 
 the last result presented concerned the definition of a formal 
correspondence between institution and organization specifications 
 definition which provides a formal way for switching between 
the two paradigms all in all these results deliver a way for relating 
abstract system specifications i e institutions as sets of norms to 
specifications that are closer to an implemented system i e 
organizational structures
