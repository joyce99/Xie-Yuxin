abstract 
in set-system auctions there are several overlapping teams of agents 
and a task that can be completed by any of these teams the 
auctioneer s goal is to hire a team and pay as little as possible 
examples of this setting include shortest-path auctions and vertex-cover 
auctions recently karlin kempe and tamir introduced a new 
definition of frugality ratio for this problem informally the frugality 
ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired 
payment bound the ratio captures the extent to which the 
mechanism overpays relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction 
in this paper we propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction 
for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio we show 
that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and 
the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible 
worst-case bound this is the first auction for this problem to have 
these properties moreover we show how to transform any 
truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation 
ratio also we consider two natural modifications of the definition 
of karlin et al and we analyse the properties of the resulting 
payment bounds such as monotonicity computational hardness and 
robustness with respect to the draw-resolution rule we study the 
relationships between the different payment bounds both for 
general set systems and for specific set-system auctions such as path 
auctions and vertex-cover auctions we use these new definitions 
in the proof of our main result for vertex-cover auctions via a 
bootstrapping technique which may be of independent interest

 introduction 
in a set system auction there is a single buyer and many vendors 
that can provide various services it is assumed that the buyer s 
requirements can be satisfied by various subsets of the vendors these 
subsets are called the feasible sets a widely-studied class of 
setsystem auctions is path auctions where each vendor is able to sell 
access to a link in a network and the feasible sets are those sets 
whose links contain a path from a given source to a given 
destination the study of these auctions has been initiated in the seminal 
paper by nisan and ronen see also 
we assume that each vendor has a cost of providing his services 
but submits a possibly larger bid to the auctioneer based on these 
bids the auctioneer selects a feasible subset of vendors and makes 
payments to the vendors in this subset each selected vendor enjoys 
a profit of payment minus cost vendors want to maximise profit 
while the buyer wants to minimise the amount he pays a natural 
goal in this setting is to design a truthful auction in which vendors 
have an incentive to bid their true cost this can be achieved by 
paying each selected vendor a premium above her bid in such a 
way that the vendor has no incentive to overbid an interesting 
question in mechanism design is how much the auctioneer will have 
to overpay in order to ensure truthful bids 
in the context of path auctions this topic was first addressed by 
archer and tardos they define the frugality ratio of a 
mechanism as the ratio between its total payment and the cost of the 
cheapest path disjoint from the path selected by the mechanism 
they show that for a large class of truthful mechanisms for this 
problem the frugality ratio is as large as the number of edges in the 
shortest path talwar extends this definition of frugality ratio 
to general set systems and studies the frugality ratio of the classical 
vcg mechanism for many specific set systems such as 
minimum spanning trees and set covers 
while the definition of frugality ratio proposed by is 
wellmotivated and has been instrumental in studying truthful 
mechanisms for set systems it is not completely satisfactory consider 
for example the graph of figure with the costs cab cbc 
a b 
c 
d 
figure the diamond graph 
 
ccd cac cbd this graph is -connected and the 
vcg payment to the winning path abcd is bounded however 
the graph contains no a-d path that is disjoint from abcd and 
hence the frugality ratio of vcg on this graph remains undefined 
at the same time there is no monopoly that is there is no 
vendor that appears in all feasible sets in auctions for other types of 
set systems the requirement that there exist a feasible solution 
disjoint from the selected one is even more severe for example for 
vertex-cover auctions where vendors correspond to the vertices of 
some underlying graph and the feasible sets are vertex covers the 
requirement means that the graph must be bipartite to deal with 
this problem karlin et al suggest a better benchmark which 
is defined for any monopoly-free set system this quantity which 
they denote by ν intuitively corresponds to the value of a cheapest 
nash equilibrium based on this new definition the authors 
construct new mechanisms for the shortest path problem and show that 
the overpayment of these mechanisms is within a constant factor of 
optimal 
 our results 
vertex cover auctions we propose a truthful polynomial-time 
auction for vertex cover that outputs a solution whose cost is within 
a factor of of optimal and whose frugality ratio is at most δ 
where δ is the maximum degree of the graph theorem we 
complement this result by proving theorem that for any δ and 
n there are graphs of maximum degree δ and size θ n for which 
any truthful mechanism has frugality ratio at least δ this means 
that the solution quality of our auction is with a factor of of 
optimal and the frugality ratio is within a factor of of the best 
possible bound for worst-case inputs to the best of our knowledge 
this is the first auction for this problem that enjoys these 
properties moreover we show how to transform any truthful mechanism 
for the vertex-cover problem into a frugal one while preserving the 
approximation ratio 
frugality ratios our vertex cover results naturally suggest two 
modifications of the definition of ν in these modifications 
can be made independently of each other resulting in four 
different payment bounds tumax tumin ntumax and ntumin 
where ntumin is equal to the original payment bound ν of in 
all four payment bounds arise as nash equilibria of certain games 
 see the full version of this paper the differences between 
them can be seen as the price of initiative and the price of 
cooperation see section while our main result about vertex 
cover auctions theorem is with respect to ntumin ν we 
make use of the new definitions by first comparing the payment of 
our mechanism to a weaker bound ntumax and then 
bootstrapping from this result to obtain the desired bound 
inspired by this application we embark on a further study of 
these payment bounds our results here are as follows 
 we observe proposition that the four payment bounds 
always obey a particular order that is independent of the choice of 
the set system and the cost vector namely tumin ≤ ntumin ≤ 
ntumax ≤ tumax we provide examples proposition and 
corollaries and showing that for the vertex cover problem any 
two consecutive bounds can differ by a factor of n − where n is 
the number of agents we then show theorem that this 
separation is almost best possible for general set systems by proving that 
for any set system tumax tumin ≤ n in contrast we 
demonstrate theorem that for path auctions tumax tumin ≤ 
we provide examples propositions and showing that this 
bound is tight we see this as an argument for the study of 
vertexcover auctions as they appear to be more representative of the 
general team -selection problem than the widely studied path auctions 
 we show theorem that for any set system if there is a cost 
vector for which tumin and ntumin differ by a factor of α 
there is another cost vector that separates ntumin and ntumax 
by the same factor and vice versa the same is true for the pairs 
 ntumin ntumax and ntumax tumax this 
symmetry is quite surprising since e g tumin and ntumax are 
obtained from ntumin by two very different transformations this 
observation suggests that the four payment bounds should be 
studied in a unified framework moreover it leads us to believe that the 
bootstrapping technique of theorem may have other applications 
 we evaluate the payment bounds introduced here with respect 
to a checklist of desirable features in particular we note that the 
payment bound ν ntumin of exhibits some 
counterintuitive properties such as nonmonotonicity with respect to adding a 
new feasible set proposition and is np-hard to compute 
 theorem while some of the other payment bounds do not suffer from 
these problems this can be seen as an argument in favour of using 
weaker but efficiently computable bounds ntumax and tumax 
related work 
vertex-cover auctions have been studied in the past by talwar 
and calinescu both of these papers are based on the definition 
of frugality ratio used in as mentioned before this means that 
their results only apply to bipartite graphs talwar shows that 
the frugality ratio of vcg is at most δ however since finding 
the cheapest vertex cover is an np-hard problem the vcg 
mechanism is computationally infeasible the first and to the best of 
our knowledge only paper to investigate polynomial-time truthful 
mechanisms for vertex cover is this paper studies an auction 
that is based on the greedy allocation algorithm which has an 
approximation ratio of log n while the main focus of is the more 
general set cover problem the results of imply a frugality ratio 
of δ 
for vertex cover our results improve on those of as 
our mechanism is polynomial-time computable as well as on those 
of as our mechanism has a better approximation ratio and we 
prove a stronger bound on the frugality ratio moreover this bound 
also applies to the mechanism of 
 preliminaries 
in most of this paper we discuss auctions for set systems a 
set system is a pair e f where e is the ground set e n 
and f is a collection of feasible sets which are subsets of e two 
particular types of set systems are of interest to us - shortest path 
systems in which the ground set consists of all edges of a network 
and the feasible sets are paths between two specified vertices s and 
t and vertex cover systems in which the elements of the ground set 
are the vertices of a graph and the feasible sets are vertex covers of 
this graph 
in set system auctions each element e of the ground set is owned 
by an independent agent and has an associated non-negative cost ce 
the goal of the centre is to select purchase a feasible set each 
element e in the selected set incurs a cost of ce the elements that 
are not selected incur no costs 
the auction proceeds as follows all elements of the ground set 
make their bids the centre selects a feasible set based on the bids 
and makes payments to the agents formally an auction is defined 
by an allocation rule a rn 
→ f and a payment rule p rn 
→ 
rn 
 the allocation rule takes as input a vector of bids and decides 
which of the sets in f should be selected the payment rule also 
takes as input a vector of bids and decides how much to pay to each 
agent the standard requirements are individual rationality i e 
the payment to each agent should be at least as high as his incurred 
cost for agents not in the selected set and ce for agents in the 
 
selected set and incentive compatibility or truthfulness i e each 
agent s dominant strategy is to bid his true cost 
an allocation rule is monotone if an agent cannot increase his 
chance of getting selected by raising his bid formally for any bid 
vector b and any e ∈ e if e ∈ a b then e ∈ a b be bn 
for any be be given a monotone allocation rule a and a bid 
vector b the threshold bid te of an agent e ∈ a b is the highest 
bid of this agent that still wins the auction given that the bids of 
other participants remain the same formally te sup be ∈ r 
e ∈ a b be bn it is well known see e g 
that any auction that has a monotone allocation rule and pays each 
agent his threshold bid is truthful conversely any truthful auction 
has a monotone allocation rule 
the vcg mechanism is a truthful mechanism that maximises 
the social welfare and pays to the losing agents for set system 
auctions this simply means picking a cheapest feasible set paying 
each agent in the selected set his threshold bid and paying to 
all other agents note however that the vcg mechanism may be 
difficult to implement since finding a cheapest feasible set may be 
intractable

 frugality ratios 
we start by reproducing the definition of the quantity ν from 
definition 
let e f be a set system and let s be a cheapest feasible set 
with respect to the true costs ce then ν c s is the solution to the 
following optimisation problem 
minimise b 
p 
e∈s be subject to 
 be ≥ ce for all e ∈ e 
 
p 
e∈s\t be ≤ 
p 
e∈t \s ce for all t ∈ f 
 for every e ∈ s there is a te ∈ f such that e ∈ te andp 
e ∈s\te 
be 
p 
e ∈te\s ce 
the bound ν c s can be seen as an outcome of a two-stage 
process where first each agent e ∈ s makes a bid be stating how 
much it wants to be paid and then the centre decides whether to 
accept these bids the behaviour of both parties is affected by the 
following considerations from the centre s point of view the set 
s must remain the most attractive choice i e it must be among 
the cheapest feasible sets under the new costs ce ce for e ∈ s 
ce be for e ∈ s condition the reason for that is that 
if is violated for some set t the centre would prefer t to s 
on the other hand no agent would agree to a payment that does 
not cover his costs condition and moreover each agent tries 
to maximise his profit by bidding as high as possible i e none 
of the agents can increase his bid without violating condition 
 condition the centre wants to minimise the total payout so 
ν c s corresponds to the best possible outcome from the centre s 
point of view 
this definition captures many important aspects of our intuition 
about  fair payments however it can be modified in two ways 
both of which are still quite natural but result in different payment 
bounds 
first we can consider the worst rather than the best possible 
outcome for the centre that is we can consider the maximum total 
payment that the agents can extract by jointly selecting their bids 
subject to and such a bound corresponds to 
maximising b subject to and rather than minimising it if it 
is the agents who make the original bids rather than the centre 
this kind of bidding behaviour is plausible on the other hand in a 
game in which the centre proposes payments to the agents in s and 
the agents accept them as long as and are satisfied we 
would be likely to observe a total payment of ν c s hence the 
difference between these two definitions can be seen as the price 
of initiative 
second the agents may be able to make payments to each other 
in this case if they can extract more money from the centre by 
agreeing on a vector of bids that violates individual rationality i e 
condition for some bidders they might be willing to do so as 
the agents who are paid below their costs will be compensated by 
other members of the group the bids must still be realistic i e 
they have to satisfy be ≥ the resulting change in payments can 
be seen as the price of co-operation and corresponds to replacing 
condition with the following weaker condition 
 
be ≥ for all e ∈ e 
 
by considering all possible combinations of these modifications 
we obtain four different payment bounds namely 
 tumin c s which is the solution to the optimisation 
problem minimise b subject to 
 and 
 tumax c s which is the solution to the optimisation 
problem maximise b subject to 
 and 
 ntumin c s which is the solution to the optimisation 
problem minimise b subject to and 
 ntumax c s which is the solution to the optimisation 
problem maximise b subject to 
the abbreviations tu and ntu correspond respectively to 
transferable utility and non-transferable utility i e the agents 
ability inability to make payments to each other for concreteness 
we will take tumin c to be tumin c s where s is the 
lexicographically least amongst the cheapest feasible sets we 
define tumax c ntumin c ntumax c and ν c similarly 
though we will see in section that in fact ntumin c s and 
ntumax c s are independent of the choice of s note that the 
quantity ν c from is ntumin c 
the second modification transferable utility is more intuitively 
appealing in the context of the maximisation problem as both 
assume some degree of co-operation between the agents while the 
second modification can be made without the first the resulting 
payment bound tumin c s is too strong to be a realistic 
benchmark at least for general set systems in particular it can be smaller 
than the total cost of the cheapest feasible set s see section 
nevertheless we provide the definition as well as some results 
about tumin c s in the paper both for completeness and 
because we believe that it may help to understand which properties 
of the payment bounds are important for our proofs another 
possibility would be to introduce an additional constraint 
p 
e∈s be ≥p 
e∈s ce in the definition of tumin c s note that this 
condition holds automatically for tumax c s as tumax c s ≥ 
ntumax c s however such a definition would have no direct 
game-theoretic interpretation and some of our results in 
particular the ones in section would no longer be true 
remark for the payment bounds that are derived from 
maximisation problems i e tumax c s and ntumax c s 
constraints of type are redundant and can be dropped hence 
tumax c s and ntumax c s are solutions to linear 
programs and therefore can be computed in polynomial time as long 
as we have a separation oracle for constraints in in contrast 
 
ntumin c s can be np-hard to compute even if the size of f is 
polynomial see section 
the first and third inequalities in the following observation 
follow from the fact that condition 
 is strictly weaker than 
condition 
proposition 
tumin c s ≤ ntumin c s ≤ 
ntumax c s ≤ tumax c s 
let m be a truthful mechanism for e f let pm c denote 
the total payments of m when the actual costs are c a frugality 
ratio of m with respect to a payment bound is the ratio between 
the payment of m and this payment bound in particular 
φtumin m sup

pm c tumin c 
φtumax m sup 
c 
pm c tumax c 
φntumin m sup

pm c ntumin c 
φntumax m sup

we conclude this section by showing that there exist set systems 
and respective cost vectors for which all four payment bounds are 
different in the next section we quantify this difference both for 
general set systems and for specific types of set systems such as 
path auctions or vertex cover auctions 
example consider the shortest-path auction on the graph 
of figure the cheapest feasible sets are all paths from a to d it 
can be verified using the reasoning of propositions and below 
that for the cost vector cab ccd cbc cac cbd 
 we have 
 tumax c with bab bcd bbc 
 ntumax c with bab bcd bbc 
 ntumin c with bab bcd bbc 
 tumin c with bab bcd bbc 
 comparing payment bounds 
 path auctions 
we start by showing that for path auctions any two consecutive 
payment bounds can differ by at least a factor of 
proposition there is an instance of the shortest-path 
problem for which we have ntumax c ntumin c ≥ 
proof this construction is due to david kempe 
consider the graph of figure with the edge costs cab cbc 
ccd cac cbd under these costs abcd is the 
cheapest path the inequalities in are bab bbc ≤ cac 
bbc bcd ≤ cbd by condition both of these 
inequalities must be tight the former one is the only inequality 
involving bab and the latter one is the only inequality involving bcd 
the inequalities in are bab ≥ bbc ≥ bcd ≥ now 
if the goal is to maximise bab bbc bcd the best choice is 
bab bcd bbc so ntumax c on the other 
hand if the goal is to minimise bab bbc bcd one should set 
bab bcd bbc so ntumin c 
proposition there is an instance of the shortest-path 
problem for which we have tumax c ntumax c ≥ 
proof again consider the graph of figure let the edge 
costs be cab ccd cbc cac cbd abcd 
is the lexicographically-least cheapest path so we can assume that 
s ab bc cd the inequalities in are the same as in 
the previous example and by the same argument both of them are 
in fact equalities the inequalities in are bab ≥ bbc ≥ 
bcd ≥ our goal is to maximise bab bbc bcd if we have 
to respect the inequalities in we have to set bab bcd 
bbc so ntumax c otherwise we can set bab 
bcd bbc so tumax c ≥ 
proposition there is an instance of the shortest-path 
problem for which we have ntumin c tumin c ≥ 
proof this construction is also based on the graph of figure 
the edge costs are cab ccd cbc cac cbd 
 abcd is the lexicographically least cheapest path so we can 
assume that s ab bc cd again the inequalities in 
are the same and both are in fact equalities the inequalities in 
are bab ≥ bbc ≥ bcd ≥ our goal is to minimise bab 
bbc bcd if we have to respect the inequalities in we have to 
set bab bcd bbc so ntumin c otherwise 
we can set bab bcd bbc so tumin c ≤ 
in section theorem we show that the separation results 
in propositions and are optimal 
 connections between separation results 
the separation results for path auctions are obtained on the same 
graph using very similar cost vectors it turns out that this is not 
coincidental namely we can prove the following theorem

where the maximum is over all cost vectors c for which s is a 
cheapest feasible set 
the proof of the theorem follows directly from the four lemmas 
proved below more precisely the first equality in theorem is 
obtained by combining lemmas and and the second equality is 
obtained by combining lemmas and we prove lemma here 
the proofs of lemmas - are similar and can be found in the full 
version of this paper 
lemma suppose that c is a cost vector for e f such that 
s is a cheapest feasible set and tumax c s ntumax c s 
α then there is a cost vector c such that s is a cheapest feasible 
set and ntumax c s ntumin c s ≥ α 
proof suppose that tumax c s x and ntumax c s 
y where x y α assume without loss of generality that s 
consists of elements k and let b 
 b 
 b

k be the bid vectors that correspond to tumax c s 
and ntumax c s respectively 
construct the cost vector c by setting ci ci for i ∈ s 
ci min ci b 
i for i ∈ s clearly s is a cheapest set under c 
moreover as the costs of elements outside of s remained the same 
the right-hand sides of all constraints in did not change so any 
bid vector that satisfies and with respect to c also satisfies 
them with respect to c we will construct two bid vectors b 
and 
b 
that satisfy conditions and for the cost vector c and

and ntumin c s ≤ y this implies the lemma 
we can set b 
i b 
i this bid vector satisfies conditions 
and since b 
does and we have b 
i ≥ min ci b 
i ci 
which means that b 
satisfies condition furthermore we can 
set b 
i b 
i again b 
satisfies conditions and since b 
does and since b 
satisfies condition we have b 
i ≥ ci ≥ ci 
which means that b 
satisfies condition 
lemma suppose c is a cost vector for e f such that s is 
a cheapest feasible set and ntumax c s ntumin c s α 
then there is a cost vector c such that s is a cheapest feasible set 
and tumax c s ntumax c s ≥ α 
lemma suppose that c is a cost vector for e f such that 
s is a cheapest feasible set and ntumax c s ntumin c s 
α then there is a cost vector c such that s is a cheapest feasible 
set and ntumin c s tumin c s ≥ α 
lemma suppose that c is a cost vector for e f such that 
s is a cheapest feasible set and ntumin c s tumin c s 
α then there is a cost vector c such that s is a cheapest feasible 
set and ntumax c s ntumin c s ≥ α 
 vertex-cover auctions 
in contrast to the case of path auctions for vertex-cover 
auctions the gap between ntumin c and ntumax c and hence 
between ntumax c and tumax c and between tumin c 
and ntumin c can be proportional to the size of the graph 
proposition for any n ≥ there is a an n-vertex graph 
and a cost vector c for which tumax c ntumax c ≥ n − 
proof the underlying graph consists of an n − -clique on 
the vertices x xn− and an extra vertex x adjacent to 
xn− the costs are cx cx · · · cxn− cx 
cxn− we can assume that s x x xn− this 
is the lexicographically first vertex cover of cost for this set 
system the constraints in are bxi bx ≤ cxn− for 
i n − clearly we can satisfy conditions and 
by setting bxi for i n − bx hence 
tumax c ≥ n − for ntumax c there is an additional 
constraint bx ≥ so the best we can do is to set bxi for 
i n − bx which implies ntumax c 
combining proposition with lemmas and we derive the 
following corollaries 
corollary for any n ≥ we can construct an instance 
of the vertex cover problem on a graph of size n that satisfies 
ntumax c ntumin c ≥ n − 
corollary for any n ≥ we can construct an instance

 upper bounds 
it turns out that the lower bound proved in the previous 
subsection is almost tight more precisely the following theorem shows 
that no two payment bounds can differ by more than a factor of n 
moreover this is the case not just for the vertex cover problem but 
for general set systems we bound the gap between tumax c and 
tumin c since tumin c ≤ ntumin c ≤ ntumax c ≤ 
tumax c this bound applies to any pair of payment bounds 
theorem for any set system e f and any cost vector c 
we have tumax c tumin c ≤ n 
proof assume wlog that the winning set s consists of 
elements k let c ck be the true costs of elements in s 
let b bk be their bids that correspond to tumin c and let 
b bk be their bids that correspond to tumax c 
consider the conditions and for s one can pick a subset 
l of at most k inequalities in so that for each i k there 
is at least one inequality in l that is tight for bi suppose that the 
jth inequality in l is of the form bi · · · bit ≤ c tj \ s for 
bi all inequalities in l are in fact equalities hence by adding 
up all of them we obtain k 
p 
i k bi ≥ 
p 
j k c tj \ s 
on the other hand all these inequalities appear in condition so 
they must hold for bi i e 
p 
i k bi ≤ 
p 
j k c tj \ s 
combining these two inequalities we obtain 
ntumin c ≥ ktumin c ≥ tumax c 
remark the final line of the proof of theorem shows 
that in fact the upper bound on tumax c tumin c can be 
strengthened to the size of the winning set k note that in 
proposition as well as in corollaries and k n− so these results 
do not contradict each other 
for path auctions this upper bound can be improved to 
matching the lower bounds of section 
theorem for any instance of the shortest path problem 
tumax c ≤ tumin c 
proof given a network g s t assume without loss of 
generality that the lexicographically-least cheapest s-t path p in g 
is e ek where e s v e v v ek 
 vk− t let c ck be the true costs of e ek and let 
b b bk and b b bk be bid vectors that 
correspond to tumin c and tumax c respectively 
for any i k there is a constraint in that is tight for 
bi with respect to the bid vector b i e an s-t path pi that avoids 
ei and satisfies b p \pi c pi \p we can assume without loss 
of generality that pi coincides with p up to some vertex xi then 
deviates from p to avoid ei and finally returns to p at a vertex 
 
yi and coincides with p from then on clearly it might happen 
that s xi or t yi indeed if pi deviates from p more than 
once one of these deviations is not necessary to avoid ei and can 
be replaced with the respective segment of p without increasing the 
cost of pi among all paths of this form let ˆpi be the one with the 
largest value of yi i e the rightmost one this path corresponds 
to an inequality ii of the form bxi · · · byi 
≤ c ˆpi \ p 
as in the proof of theorem we construct a set of tight 
constraints l such that every variable bi appears in at least one of these 
constraints however now we have to be more careful about the 
choice of constraints in l we construct l inductively as follows 
start by setting l i at the jth step suppose that all 
variables up to but not including bij 
appear in at least one inequality 
in l add iij to l 
note that for any j we have yij yij this is because the 
inequalities added to l during the first j steps did not cover bij 
 
see figure since yij yij we must also have xij 
yij otherwise ˆpij would not be the rightmost constraint for 
bij 
 therefore the variables in iij and iij do not overlap and 
hence no bi can appear in more than two inequalities in l 
now we follow the argument of the proof of theorem to finish 
by adding up all of the tight inequalities in l for bi we obtain 
 
p 
i k bi ≥ 
p 
j k c ˆpj \ p on the other hand all 
these inequalities appear in condition so they must hold for 
bi i e 
p 
i k bi ≤ 
p 
j k c ˆpj \ p so tumax c ≤ 
 tumin c 
 truthful mechanisms for 
vertex cover 
recall that for a vertex-cover auction on a graph g v e an 
allocation rule is an algorithm that takes as input a bid bv for each 
vertex and returns a vertex cover ˆs of g as explained in 
section we can combine a monotone allocation rule with threshold 
payments to obtain a truthful auction 
two natural examples of monotone allocation rules are aopt i e 
the algorithm that finds an optimal vertex cover and the greedy 
algorithm agr however aopt cannot be guaranteed to run in 
polynomial time unless p np and agr has approximation 
ratio of log n 
another approximation algorithm for vertex cover which has 
approximation ratio is the local ratio algorithm alr this 
algorithm considers the edges of g one by one given an edge 
e u v it computes min bu bv and sets bu bu − 
bv bv − after all edges have been processed alr returns 
the set of vertices v bv it is not hard to check that if 
the order in which the edges are considered is independent of the 
bids then this algorithm is monotone as well hence we can use it 
to construct a truthful auction that is guaranteed to select a vertex 
cover whose cost is within a factor of from the optimal 
however while the quality of the solution produced by alr is 
much better than that of agr we still need to show that its total 
payment is not too high in the next subsection we bound the 
frugality ratio of alr and more generally all algorithms that satisfy 
the condition of local optimality defined later by δ where δ is 
the maximum degree of g we then prove a matching lower bound 
showing that for some graphs the frugality ratio of any truthful 
auction is at least δ 
 upper bound 
we say that an allocation rule is locally optimal if whenever bv p 
w∼v bw the vertex v is not chosen note that for any such rule 
the threshold bid of v satisfies tv ≤ 
p 
w∼v bw 
claim the algorithms aopt agr and alr are locally 
optimal 
theorem any vertex cover auction m that has a locally 
optimal and monotone allocation rule and pays each agent his 
threshold bid has frugality ratio φntumin m ≤ δ 
to prove theorem we first show that the total payment of 
any locally optimal mechanism does not exceed δc v we then 
demonstrate that ntumin c ≥ c v by combining these 
two results the theorem follows 
lemma consider a graph g v e with maximum 
degree δ let m be a vertex-cover auction on g that satisfies the 
conditions of theorem then for any cost vector c the total 
payment of m satisfies pm c ≤ δc v 
proof first note that any such auction is truthful so we can 
assume that each agent s bid is equal to his cost let ˆs be the 
vertex cover selected by m then by local optimality

we now derive a lower bound on tumax c while not essential 
for the proof of theorem it helps us build the intuition necessary 
for that proof 
lemma for a vertex cover instance g v e in which s 
is a minimum vertex cover tumax c s ≥ c v \ s 
proof for a vertex w with at least one neighbour in s let 
d w denote the number of neighbours that w has in s consider 
the bid vector b in which for each v ∈ s bv

next we prove a lower bound on ntumax c s we will then 
use it to obtain a lower bound on ntumin c 
lemma for a vertex cover instance g v e in which s 
is a minimum vertex cover ntumax c s ≥ c v \ s 
proof if c s ≥ c v \ s by condition we are done 
therefore for the rest of the proof we assume that c s c v \ 
s we show how to construct a bid vector be e∈s that satisfies 
conditions and such that b s ≥ c v \ s clearly this 
implies ntumax c s ≥ c v \ s 
recall that a network flow problem is described by a directed 
graph γ vγ eγ a source node s ∈ vγ a sink node t ∈ 
vγ and a vector of capacity constraints ae e ∈ eγ consider a 
network vγ eγ such that vγ v ∪ s t eγ e ∪e ∪e 
where e s v v ∈ s e v w v ∈ s w ∈ 
 
v \ s v w ∈ e e w t w ∈ v \ s since s is 
a vertex cover for g no edge of e can have both of its endpoints 
in v \ s and by construction e contains no edges with both 
endpoints in s therefore the graph v e is bipartite with parts 
 s v \ s 
set the capacity constraints for e ∈ eγ as follows a s v 
cv a w t cw a v w ∞ for all v ∈ s w ∈ v \ s 
recall that a cut is a partition of the vertices in vγ into two sets 
c and c so that s ∈ c t ∈ c we denote such a cut by 
c c c abusing notation we write e u v ∈ c if 
u ∈ c v ∈ c or u ∈ c v ∈ c and say that such an edge 
e u v crosses the cut c the capacity of a cut c is computed 
as cap c 
p 
 v w ∈c a v w we have cap s v ∪ t c s 
cap s ∪ v t c v \ s 
let cmin s ∪ s ∪ w t ∪ s ∪ w be a minimum 
cut in γ where s s ⊆ s w w ⊆ v \ s see figure as 
cap cmin ≤ cap s v ∪ t c s ∞ and any edge in 
e has infinite capacity no edge u v ∈ e crosses cmin 
consider the network γ vγ eγ where vγ s ∪ 
s ∪ w ∪ t eγ u v ∈ eγ u v ∈ vγ clearly 
c s ∪ s ∪ w t is a minimum cut in γ otherwise 
there would exist a smaller cut for γ as cap c c w we 
have c s ≥ c w 
now consider the network γ vγ eγ where vγ 
 s ∪ s ∪ w ∪ t eγ u v ∈ eγ u v ∈ vγ 
similarly c s s ∪ w ∪ t is a minimum cut in γ 
cap c c s as the size of a maximum flow from s to 
t is equal to the capacity of a minimum cut separating s and t 
there exists a flow f fe e∈eγ 
of size c s this flow has 
to saturate all edges between s and s i e f s v cv for all 
v ∈ s now increase the capacities of all edges between s and 
s to ∞ in the modified network the capacity of a minimum cut 
 and hence the size of a maximum flow is c w and a maximum 
flow f fe e∈eγ 
can be constructed by greedily augmenting 
f 
set bv cv for all v ∈ s bv f s v for all v ∈ s as f is 
constructed by augmenting f we have bv ≥ cv for all v ∈ s i e 
condition is satisfied 
now let us check that no vertex cover t ⊆ v can violate 
condition set t t ∩ s t t ∩ s t t ∩ w 
t t ∩ w our goal is to show that b s \ t b s \ t ≤ 
c t c t consider all edges u v ∈ e such that u ∈ s \t 
if u v ∈ e then v ∈ t no edge in e can cross the cut and if 
u v ∈ s then v ∈ t ∪t hence t ∪t ∪s is a vertex cover for 
g and therefore c t c t c s ≥ c s c t c s \ 
t c s consequently c t ≥ c s \ t b s \ t 
now consider the vertices in s \t any edge in e that starts in 
one of these vertices has to end in t this edge has to be covered by 
t and it cannot go across the cut therefore the total flow out of 
s \t is at most the total flow out of t i e b s \t ≤ c t 
hence b s \ t b s \ t ≤ c t c t 
finally we derive a lower bound on the payment bound that is 
of interest to us namely ntumin c 
lemma for a vertex cover instance g v e in which s 
is a minimum vertex cover ntumin c s ≥ c v \ s 
proof suppose for contradiction that c is a cost vector with 
minimum-cost vertex cover s and ntumin c s c v \s let 
b be the corresponding bid vector and let c be a new cost vector 
with cv bv for v ∈ s and cv cv for v ∈ s condition 
guarantees that s is an optimal solution to the cost vector c now

figure proof of lemma dashed lines correspond to edges 
in e \ e 
claim that bv cv for any v ∈ s indeed suppose that bv cv 
for some v ∈ s bv cv for v ∈ s by construction as b satisfies 
conditions - among the inequalities in there is one that is 
tight for v and the bid vector b that is b s \ t c t \ s by 
the construction of c c s \ t c t \ s now since bw ≥ cw 
for all w ∈ s bv cv implies b s \t c s \t c t \s 
but this violates so we now know b c hence we have 
ntumax c s 
p 
v∈s bv ntumin c s c v \ s 
giving a contradiction to the fact that ntumax c s ≥ c v \s 
which we proved in lemma 
as ntumin c s satisfies condition it follows that we 
have ntumin c s ≥ c s together will lemma this implies 
ntumin c s ≥ max c v \ s c s ≥ c v combined 
with lemma this completes the proof of theorem 
remark as ntumin c ≤ ntumax c ≤ tumax c 
our bound of δ extends to the smaller frugality ratios that we 
consider i e φntumax m and φtumax m it is not clear whether 
it extends to the larger frugality ratio φtumin m however the 
frugality ratio φtumin m is not realistic because the payment 
bound tumin c is inappropriately low - we show in section 
that tumin c can be significantly smaller than the total cost of a 
cheapest vertex cover 
extensions 
we can also apply our results to monotone vertex-cover algorithms 
that do not necessarily output locally-optimal solutions to do so 
we simply take the vertex cover produced by any such algorithm 
and transform it into a locally-optimal one considering the vertices 
in lexicographic order and replacing a vertex v with its neighbours 
whenever bv 
p 
u∼v bu note that if a vertex u has been added to 
the vertex cover during this process it means that it has a neighbour 
whose bid is higher than bu so after one pass all vertices in the 
vertex cover satisfy bv ≤ 
p 
u∼v bu this procedure is monotone in 
bids and it can only decrease the cost of the vertex cover 
therefore using it on top of a monotone allocation rule with 
approx 
imation ratio α we obtain a monotone locally-optimal allocation 
rule with approximation ratio α combining it with threshold 
payments we get an auction with φntumin ≤ δ since any truthful 
auction has a monotone allocation rule this procedure transforms 
any truthful mechanism for the vertex-cover problem into a frugal 
one while preserving the approximation ratio 
 lower bound 
in this subsection we prove that the upper bound of theorem 
is essentially optimal our proof uses the techniques of where 
the authors prove a similar result for shortest-path auctions 
theorem for any δ and any n there exist a graph g 
of maximum degree δ and size n n such that for any truthful 
mechanism m on g we have φntumin m ≥ δ 
proof given n and δ set k n δ let g be the graph 
that consists of k blocks b bk of size δ each where each 
bi is a complete bipartite graph with parts li and ri li 
 ri δ 
we will consider two families of cost vectors for g under a 
cost vector x ∈ x each block bi has one vertex of cost all 
other vertices cost under a cost vector y ∈ y there is one block 
that has two vertices of cost one in each part all other blocks 
have one vertex of cost and all other vertices cost clearly 
 x δ k 
 y k δ k− 
δ 
 we will now construct a 
bipartite graph w with the vertex set x ∪ y as follows 
consider a cost vector y ∈ y that has two vertices of cost in 
bi let these vertices be vl ∈ li and vr ∈ ri by changing the 
cost of either of these vertices to we obtain a cost vector in x 
let xl and xr be the cost vectors obtained by changing the cost of 
vl and vr respectively the vertex cover chosen by m y must 
either contain all vertices in li or it must contain all vertices in ri 
in the former case we put in w an edge from y to xl and in the 
latter case we put in w an edge from y to xr if the vertex cover 
includes all of bi w contains both of these edges 
the graph w has at least k δ k− 
δ 
edges so there must 
exist an x ∈ x of degree at least kδ let y ykδ be 
the other endpoints of the edges incident to x and for each i 
 kδ let vi be the vertex whose cost is different under x 
and yi note that all vi are distinct 
it is not hard to see that ntumin x ≤ k the cheapest vertex 
cover contains the all- part of each block and we can satisfy 
conditions - by letting one of the vertices in the all- part of each 
block to bid while all other the vertices in the cheapest set bid 
on the other hand by monotonicity of m we have vi ∈ m x 
for i kδ vi is in the winning set under yi and x is 
obtained from yi by decreasing the cost of vi and moreover the 
threshold bid of each vi is at least so the total payment of m on x 
is at least kδ hence φntumin m ≥ m x ntumin x ≥ 
δ 
remark the lower bound of theorem can be generalised 
to randomised mechanisms where a randomised mechanism is 
considered to be truthful if it can be represented as a probability 
distribution over truthful mechanisms in this case instead of choosing 
the vertex x ∈ x with the highest degree we put both y xl 
and y xr into w label each edge with the probability that the 
respective part of the block is chosen and pick x ∈ x with the 
highest weighted degree the argument can be further extended to 
a more permissive definition of truthfulness for randomised 
mechanisms but this discussion is beyond the scope of this paper 
 properties of payment bounds 
in this section we consider several desirable properties of 
payment bounds and evaluate the four payment bounds proposed in 
this paper with respect to them the particular properties that we 
are interested in are independence of the choice of s section 
monotonicity section computational hardness section 
and the relationship with other reasonable bounds such as the total 
cost of the cheapest set section or the total vcg payment 
 section 
 comparison with total cost 
our first requirement is that a payment bound should not be less 
than the total cost of the selected set payment bounds are used to 
evaluate the performance of set-system auctions the latter have to 
satisfy individual rationality i e the payment to each agent must 
be at least as large as his incurred costs it is only reasonable to 
require the payment bound to satisfy the same requirement 
clearly ntumax c and ntumin c satisfy this requirement 
due to condition and so does tumax c since tumax c ≥ 
ntumax c however tumin c fails this test the example 
of proposition shows that for path auctions tumin c can be 
smaller than the total cost by a factor of moreover there are set 
systems and cost vectors for which tumin c is smaller than the 
cost of the cheapest set s by a factor of ω n consider for 
example the vertex-cover auction for the graph of proposition with 
the costs cx · · · cxn− cxn− cx the cost 
of a cheapest vertex cover is n − and the lexicographically first 
vertex cover of cost n− is x x xn− the constraints 
in are bxi bx ≤ cxn− clearly we can satisfy 
conditions and by setting bx · · · bxn− bx 
which means that tumin c ≤ this observation suggests that 
the payment bound tumin c is too strong to be realistic since it 
can be substantially lower than the cost of the cheapest feasible set 
nevertheless some of the positive results that were proved in 
for ntumin c go through for tumin c as well in particular 
one can show that if the feasible sets are the bases of a 
monopolyfree matroid then φtumin vcg to show that φtumin vcg 
is at most one must prove that the vcg payment is at most 
tumin c this is shown for ntumin c in the first paragraph 
of the proof of theorem in their argument does not use 
condition at all so it also applies to tumin c on the other hand 
φtumin vcg ≥ since φtumin vcg ≥ φntumin vcg 
and φntumin vcg ≥ by proposition of and also by 
proposition below 
 comparison with vcg payments 
another measure of suitability for payment bounds is that they 
should not result in frugality ratios that are less then for 
wellknown truthful mechanisms if this is indeed the case the payment 
bound may be too weak as it becomes too easy to design 
mechanisms that perform well with respect to it it particular a reasonable 
requirement is that a payment bound should not exceed the total 
payment of the classical vcg mechanism 
the following proposition shows that ntumax c and 
therefore also ntumin c and tumin c do not exceed the vcg 
payment pvcg c the proof essentially follows the argument of 
proposition of and can be found in the full version of this 
paper 
proposition φntumax vcg ≥ 
proposition shows that none of the payment bounds tumin c 
ntumin c and ntumax c exceeds the payment of vcg 
however the payment bound tumax c can be larger that the total 
 
vcg payment in particular for the instance in proposition the 
vcg payment is smaller than tumax c by a factor of n − we 
have already seen that tumax c ≥ n − on the other hand 
under vcg the threshold bid of any xi i n − is 
if any such vertex bids above it is deleted from the winning set 
together with x and replaced with xn− similarly the threshold 
bid of x is because if x bids above it can be replaced with 
xn− so the vcg payment is 
this result is not surprising the definition of tumax c 
implicitly assumes there is co-operation between the agents while 
the computation of vcg payments does not take into account any 
interaction between them indeed co-operation enables the agents 
to extract higher payments under vcg that is vcg is not 
groupstrategyproof this suggests that as a payment bound tumax c 
may be too liberal at least in a context where there is little or 
no co-operation between agents perhaps tumax c can be a 
good benchmark for measuring the performance of mechanisms 
designed for agents that can form coalitions or make side payments 
to each other in particular group-strategyproof mechanisms 
another setting in which bounding φtumax is still of some 
interest is when for the underlying problem the optimal allocation 
and vcg payments are np-hard to compute in this case finding 
a polynomial-time computable mechanism with good frugality 
ratio with respect to tumax c is a non-trivial task while bounding 
the frugality ratio with respect to more challenging payment bounds 
could be too difficult to illustrate this point compare the proofs 
of lemma and lemma both require some effort but the latter 
is much more difficult than the former 
 the choice of s 
all payment bounds defined in this paper correspond to the total 
bid of all elements in the cheapest feasible set where ties are 
broken lexicographically while this definition ensures that our 
payment bounds are well-defined the particular choice of the 
drawresolution rule appears arbitrary and one might wonder if our 
payment bounds are sufficiently robust to be independent of this choice 
it turns out that is indeed the case for ntumin c and ntumax c 
i e these bounds do not depend on the draw-resolution rule to 
see this suppose that two feasible sets s and s have the same 
cost in the computation of ntumin c s all vertices in s \s 
would have to bid their true cost since otherwise s would 
become cheaper than s hence any bid vector for s can only have 
be ce for e ∈ s ∩ s and hence constitutes a valid bid vector 
for s and vice versa a similar argument applies to ntumax c 
however for tumin c and tumax c this is not the case 
for example consider the set system 
e e e e e e 
f s e e s e e e s e e 
with the costs c c c c c the cheapest 
sets are s and s now tumax c s ≤ as the total bid of 
the elements in s cannot exceed the total cost of s on the other 
hand tumax c s ≥ as we can set b b b 
similarly tumin c s because the inequalities in are 
b ≤ and b b ≤ but tumin c s ≤ as we can set 
b b b 
 negative results for ntumin c and tumin c 
the results in and our vertex cover results are proved for the 
frugality ratio φntumin indeed it can be argued that φntumin is 
the best definition of frugality ratio because among all 
reasonable payment bounds i e ones that are at least as large as the cost 
of the cheapest feasible set it is most demanding of the algorithm 
however ntumin c is not always the easiest or the most natural 
payment bound to work with in this subsection we discuss several 
disadvantages of ntumin c and also tumin c as compared 
to ntumax c and tumax c 
 nonmonotonicity 
the first problem with ntumin c is that it is not monotone 
with respect to f i e it may increase when one adds a feasible 
set to f it is however monotone in the sense that a losing agent 
cannot become a winner by raising his cost intuitively a good 
payment bound should satisfy this monotonicity requirement as 
adding a feasible set increases the competition so it should drive 
the prices down note that this indeed the case for ntumax c 
and tumax c since a new feasible set adds a constraint in 
thus limiting the solution space for the respective linear program 
proposition adding a feasible set to f can increase the 
value of ntumin c by a factor of ω n 
proof let e x xx y yn z zn set y 
 y yn s y ∪ x ti y \ yi ∪ zi i n 
and suppose that f s t tn the costs are cx 
cxx cyi czi for i n note that s is 
the cheapest feasible set let f f ∪ t where t y ∪ 
 xx for f the bid vector by · · · byn bx 
satisfies and so ntumin c ≤ for f s is still 
the lexicographically-least cheapest set any optimal solution has 
bx by constraint in with t condition for yi implies 
bx byi czi so byi and ntumin c n 
for path auctions it has been shown that ntumin c is 
non-monotone in a slightly different sense i e with respect to 
adding a new edge agent rather than a new feasible set a team 
of existing agents 
remark we can also show that ntumin c is non-monotone 
for vertex cover in this case adding a new feasible set corresponds 
to deleting edges from the graph it turns out that deleting a single 
edge can increase ntumin c by a factor of n − the 
construction is similar to that of proposition 
 np-hardness 
another problem with ntumin c s is that it is np-hard to 
compute even if the number of feasible sets is polynomial in n 
again this puts it at a disadvantage compared to ntumax c s 
and tumax c s see remark 
theorem computing ntumin c is np-hard even when 
the lexicographically-least feasible set s is given in the input 
proof we reduce exact cover by -sets x c to our 
problem an instance of x c is given by a universe g g gn 
and a collection of subsets c cm ci ⊂ g ci where 
the goal is to decide whether one can cover g by n of these sets 
observe that if this is indeed the case each element of g is 
contained in exactly one set of the cover 
lemma consider a minimisation problem p of the following 
form minimise 
p 
i n bi under conditions bi ≥ for all 
i n for any j k we have 
p 
bi∈sj 
bi ≤ aj 
where sj ⊆ b bn for each bj one of the constraints 
in involving it is tight for any such p one can construct a 
set system s and a vector of costs c such that ntumin c is the 
optimal solution to p 
proof the construction is straightforward there is an element 
of cost for each bi an element of cost aj for each aj the feasible 
solutions are b bn or any set obtained from b bn 
by replacing the elements in sj by aj 
 
by this lemma all we have to do to prove theorem is to show 
how to solve x c by using the solution to a minimisation problem 
of the form given in lemma we do this as follows for each 
ci we introduce variables xi ¯xi ai and bi also for each 
element gj of g there is a variable dj we use the following set of 
constraints 
 in we have constraints xi ≥ ¯xi ≥ ai ≥ bi ≥ 
dj ≥ for all i m j n 
 in for all i m we have the following 
constraints xi ¯xi ≤ xi ai ≤ ¯xi ai ≤ xi bi ≤ 
¯xi bi ≤ also for all j n we have a constraint 
of the form xi · · · xik dj ≤ where ci cik 
are the sets that contain gj 
the goal is to minimize z 
p 
i xi ¯xi ai bi 
p 
j dj 
observe that for each j there is only one constraint involving 
dj so by condition it must be tight 
consider the two constraints involving ai one of them must be 
tight and therefore xi ¯xi ai bi ≥ xi ¯xi ai ≥ hence for 
any feasible solution to - we have z ≥ m now suppose that 
there is an exact set cover set dj for j n also if ci 
is included in this cover set xi ¯xi ai bi otherwise 
set ¯xi xi ai bi clearly all inequalities in 
are satisfied we use the fact that each element is covered exactly 
once and for each variable one of the constraints involving it is 
tight this assignment results in z m 
conversely suppose there is a feasible solution with z m 
as each addend of the form xi ¯xi ai bi contributes at least 
 we have xi ¯xi ai bi for all i dj for all j 
we will now show that for each i either xi and ¯xi or 
xi and ¯xi for the sake of contradiction suppose that 
xi δ ¯xi δ as one of the constraints involving 
ai must be tight we have ai ≥ min − δ − δ similarly 
bi ≥ min − δ − δ hence xi ¯xi ai bi 
δ δ min −δ −δ to finish the proof note that for 
each j m we have xi · · · xik dj and dj 
so the subsets that correspond to xi constitute a set cover 
remark in the proofs of proposition and theorem all 
constraints in are of the form be ≥ hence the same results 
are true for tumin c 
remark for shortest-path auctions the size of f can be 
superpolynomial however there is a polynomial-time separation 
oracle for constraints in to construct one use any algorithm 
for finding shortest paths so one can compute ntumax c and 
tumax c in polynomial time on the other hand recently and 
independently it was shown that computing ntumin c for 
shortest-path auctions is np-hard
