abstract 
keyword auctions lie at the core of the business models of 
today s leading search engines advertisers bid for 
placement alongside search results and are charged for clicks on 
their ads advertisers are typically ranked according to a 
score that takes into account their bids and potential 
clickthrough rates we consider a family of ranking rules that 
contains those typically used to model yahoo and google s 
auction designs as special cases we find that in general 
neither of these is necessarily revenue-optimal in 
equilibrium and that the choice of ranking rule can be guided 
by considering the correlation between bidders values and 
click-through rates we propose a simple approach to 
determine a revenue-optimal ranking rule within our family 
taking into account effects on advertiser satisfaction and user 
experience we illustrate the approach using monte-carlo 
simulations based on distributions fitted to yahoo bid and 
click-through rate data for a high-volume keyword

 introduction 
major search engines like google yahoo and msn sell 
advertisements by auctioning off space on keyword search 
results pages for example when a user searches the web for 
ipod the highest paying advertisers for example apple 
or best buy for that keyword may appear in a separate 
sponsored section of the page above or to the right of the 
algorithmic results the sponsored results are displayed in a 
format similar to algorithmic results as a list of items each 
containing a title a text description and a hyperlink to a 
web page generally advertisements that appear in a higher 
position on the page garner more attention and more clicks 
from users thus all else being equal advertisers prefer 
higher positions to lower positions 
advertisers bid for placement on the page in an 
auctionstyle format where the larger their bid the more likely their 
listing will appear above other ads on the page by 
convention sponsored search advertisers generally bid and pay per 
click meaning that they pay only when a user clicks on their 
ad and do not pay if their ad is displayed but not clicked 
overture services formerly goto com and now owned by 
yahoo inc is credited with pioneering sponsored search 
advertising overture s success prompted a number of 
companies to adopt similar business models most prominently 
google the leading web search engine today microsoft s 
msn previously an affiliate of overture now operates its 
own keyword auction marketplace sponsored search is one 
of the fastest growing most effective and most profitable 
forms of advertising generating roughly billion in revenue 
in after nearly doubling every year for the previous five 
years 
the search engine evaluates the advertisers bids and 
allocates the positions on the page accordingly notice that 
although bids are expressed as payments per click the search 
engine cannot directly allocate clicks but rather allocates 
impressions or placements on the screen clicks relate only 
stochastically to impressions until recently yahoo ranked 
bidders in decreasing order of advertisers stated values per 
click while google ranks in decreasing order of advertisers 
stated values per impression in google s case value per 
impression is computed by multiplying the advertiser s 
 perclick bid by the advertisement s expected click-through rate 
where this expectation may consider a number of 
unspecified factors including historical click-through rate position 
on the page advertiser identity user identity and the 
context of other items on the page we refer to these rules as 
rank-by-bid and rank-by-revenue respectively 
we analyze a family of ranking rules that contains the 
yahoo and google models as special cases we consider 
rank 
these are industry terms we will see however that 
rankby-revenue is not necessarily revenue-optimal 
 
ing rules where bidders are ranked in decreasing order of 
score eq 
b where e denotes an advertiser s click-through rate 
 normalized for position and b his bid notice that q 
corresponds to yahoo s rank-by-bid rule and q 
corresponds to google s rank-by-revenue rule our premise is 
that bidders are playing a symmetric equilibrium as defined 
by edelman ostrovsky and schwarz and varian 
we show through simulation that although q yields 
the efficient allocation settings of q considerably less than 
 can yield superior revenue in equilibrium under certain 
conditions the key parameter is the correlation between 
advertiser value and click-through rate if this correlation is 
strongly positive then smaller q are revenue-optimal our 
simulations are based on distributions fitted to data from 
yahoo keyword auctions we propose that search engines 
set thresholds of acceptable loss in advertiser satisfaction 
and user experience then choose the revenue-optimal q 
consistent with these constraints we also compare the 
potential gains from tuning q with the gains from setting reserve 
prices and find that the former may be much more 
significant 
in section we give a formal model of keyword auctions 
and establish its equilibrium properties in section in 
section we note that giving agents bidding credits can have 
the same effect as tuning the ranking rule explicitly in 
section we give a general formulation of the optimal keyword 
auction design problem as an optimization problem in a 
manner analogous to the single-item auction setting we 
then provide some theoretical insight into how tuning q can 
improve revenue and why the correlation between bidders 
values and click-through rates is relevant in section we 
consider the effect of q on advertiser satisfaction and user 
experience in section we describe our simulations and 
interpret their results 
related work as mentioned the papers of edelman 
et al and varian lay the groundwork for our study 
both papers independently define an appealing refinement 
of nash equilibrium for keyword auctions and analyze its 
equilibrium properties they called this refinement 
locally envy-free equilibrium and symmetric equilibrium 
respectively varian also provides some empirical analysis 
the general model of keyword auctions used here where 
bidders are ranked according to a weight times their bid was 
introduced by aggarwal goel and motwani that paper 
also makes a connection between the revenue of keyword 
auctions in incomplete information settings with the revenue 
in symmetric equilibrium iyengar and kumar study 
the optimal keyword auction design problem in a setting 
of incomplete information and also make the connection 
to symmetric equilibrium we make use of this connection 
when formulating the optimal auction design problem in our 
setting 
the work most closely related to ours is that of feng 
bhargava and pennock they were the first to realize 
that the correlation between bidder values and click-through 
rates should be a key parameter affecting the revenue 
performance of various ranking mechanisms for simplicity 
they assume bidders bid their true values so their model 
is very different from ours and consequently so are their 
findings according to their simulations rank-by-revenue 
always weakly dominates rank-by-bid in terms of revenue 
whereas our results suggest that rank-by-bid may do much 
better for negative correlations 
lahaie gives an example that suggests rank-by-bid 
should yield more revenue when values and click-through 
rates are positively correlated whereas rank-by-revenue should 
do better when the correlation is negative in this work we 
make a deeper study of this conjecture 
 model 
there are k positions to be allocated among n bidders 
where n k we assume that the expected click-through 
rate of bidder s in position t is of the form esxt i e separable 
into an advertiser effect es ∈ and position effect xt ∈ 
 we assume that x x xk and let 
xt for t k we also refer to es as the relevance of 
bidder s it is useful to interpret xt as the probability that 
an ad in position t will be noticed and es as the probability 
that it will be clicked on if noticed 
bidder s has value vs for each click bidders have 
quasilinear utility so that the utility to bidder s of obtaining 
position t at a price of p per click is 
esxt vs − p 
a weight ws is associated with agent s and agents bid for 
position if agent s bids bs his corresponding score is wsbs 
agents are ranked by score so that the agent with highest 
score is ranked first and so on we assume throughout that 
agents are numbered such that agent s obtains position s 
an agent pays per click the lowest bid necessary to retain 
his position so that the agent in slot s pays 
ws 
ws 
bs the 
auctioneer may introduce a reserve score of r so that an 
agent s ad appears only if his score is at least r for agent 
s this translates into a reserve price minimum bid of r ws 
 equilibrium 
we consider the pure-strategy nash equilibria of the 
auction game this is a full-information concept the 
motivation for this choice is that in a keyword auction bidders 
are allowed to continuously adjust their bids over time and 
hence obtain estimates of their profits in various positions 
as a result it is reasonable to assume that if bids 
stabilize bidders should be playing best-responses to each other s 
bids formally in a nash equilibrium of this game 
the following inequalities hold 
esxs 
„ 
vs − 
ws 
ws 
bs 
 
≥ esxt 
„

wt

esxs 
„ 
vs − 
ws 
ws 
bs 
 
≥ esxt 
„ 
vs − 
wt 
ws 
bt 
 
∀t s 
inequalities and state that bidder s does not prefer 
a lower or higher position to his own respectively it can 
be hard to derive any theoretical insight into the properties 
of these nash equilibria-multiple allocations of positions 
to bidders can potentially arise in equilibrium 
edelman ostrovsky and schwarz introduced a refinement of 
nash equilibrium called locally envy-free equilibrium that 
is more tractable to analyze varian independently 
proposed this solution concept and called it symmetric 
equilibrium in a symmetric equilibrium inequality holds 
for all s t rather than just for t s so for all s and all 
t s we have 
esxs 
„ 
vs − 
ws 
ws 
bs 
 
≥ esxt 
„ 
vs − 
wt 
ws 
bt 
 
 
 
or equivalently 
xs wsvs − ws bs ≥ xt wsvs − wt bt 
edelman et al note that this equilibrium arises if agents 
are raising their bids to increase the payments of those above 
them a practice which is believed to be common in actual 
keyword auctions varian provides some empirical 
evidence that google bid data agrees well with the hypothesis 
that bidders are playing a symmetric equilibrium 
varian does a thorough analysis of the properties of 
symmetric equilibrium assuming ws es for all bidders 
it is straightforward to adapt his analysis to the case where 
bidders are assigned arbitrary weights and have separable 
click-through rates 
as a result we find that in symmetric 
equilibrium bidders are ranked in order of decreasing wsvs 
to be clear although the auctioneer only has access to the 
bids bs and not the values vs in symmetric equilibrium the 
bids are such that ranking according to wsbs is equivalent 
to ranking according to wsvs 
the smallest possible bid profile that can arise in 
symmetric equilibrium is given by the recursion 
xsws bs xs − xs ws vs xs ws bs 
in this work we assume that bidders are playing the smallest 
symmetric equilibrium this is an appropriate selection for 
our purposes by optimizing revenue in this equilibrium we 
are optimizing a lower bound on the revenue in any 
symmetric equilibrium unraveling the recursion yields 
xsws bs 
kx 
t s 
 xt − xt wt vt 
agent s s total expected payment is es ws times the 
quantity on the left-hand side of the base case of the 
recursion occurs for s k where we find that the first excluded 
bidder bids his true value as in the original analysis 
multiplying each of the inequalities by the 
corresponding es ws to obtain total payments and summing over all 
positions we obtain a total equilibrium revenue of 
kx 
s 
kx 
t s 
wt 
ws 
es xt − xt vt 
to summarize the minimum possible revenue in symmetric 
equilibrium can be computed as follows given the agents 
relevance-value pairs es vs first rank the agents in 
decreasing order of wsvs and then evaluate 
with a reserve score of r it follows from inequality 
that no bidder with wsvs r would want to participate 
in the auction let k r be the number of bidders with 
wsvs ≥ r and assume it is at most k we can impose a 
reserve score of r by introducing a bidder with value r and 
weight and making him the first excluded bidder who 
in symmetric equilibrium bids truthfully in this case the 
recursion yields 
xsws bs 
k r − 
x 
t s 
 xt − xt wt vt xk r r 
and the revenue formula is adapted similarly 
 
if we redefine wsvs to be vs and wsbs to be bs we 
recover varian s setup and his original analysis goes through 
unchanged 
 bidding credits 
an indirect way to influence the allocation is to introduce 
bidding credits 
suppose bidder s is only required to pay 
a fraction cs ∈ of the price he faces or equivalently a 
 − cs fraction of his clicks are received for free then in 
a symmetric equilibrium we have 
esxs 
„ 
vs − 
ws 
ws 
csbs 
 
≥ esxt 
„ 
vs − 
wt 
ws 
csbt 
 
or equivalently 
xs 
„ 
ws 
cs 
vs − ws bs 
 
≥ xt 
„ 
ws 
cs 
vs − wt bt 
 
 
if we define ws ws 
cs 
and bs csbs we recover 
inequality hence the equilibrium revenue will be as if we had 
used weights w rather than w the bids will be scaled 
versions of the bids that arise with weights w and no credits 
where each bid is scaled by the corresponding factor cs 
this technique allows one to use credits instead of explicit 
changes in the weights to affect revenue for instance 
rankby-revenue will yield the same revenue as rank-by-bid if we 
set credits to cs es 
 revenue 
we are interested in setting the weights w to achieve 
optimal expected revenue the setup is as follows the 
auctioneer chooses a function g so that the weighting scheme is 
ws ≡ g es we do not consider weights that also depend on 
the agents bids because this would invalidate the 
equilibrium analysis of the previous section 
a pool of n bidders 
is then obtained by i i d draws of value-relevance pairs from 
a common probability density f es vs we assume the 
density is continuous and has full support on × ∞ the 
revenue to the auctioneer is then the revenue generated in 
symmetric equilibrium under weighting scheme w this 
assumes the auctioneer is patient enough not to care about 
revenue until bids have stabilized 
the problem of finding an optimal weighting scheme can 
be formulated as an optimization problem very similar to 
the one derived by myerson for the single-item auction 
case with incomplete information let qsk e v w if 
agent s obtains slot k in equilibrium under weighting scheme 
w where e e en and v v vn and let it 
be otherwise 
note that the total payment of agent s in equilibrium is

 esxsvs −

the derivation then continues just as in the case of a 
singleitem auction we take the expectation of this payment 
 
hal varian suggested to us that bidding credits could be 
used to affect revenue in keyword auctions which prompted 
us to look into this connection 
 
the analysis does not generalize to weights that depend on 
bids it is unclear whether an equilibrium would exist at all 
with such weights 
 
and sum over all agents to obtain the objective

where ψ is the virtual valuation 
ψ es vs vs − 
 − f vs es 
f vs es 
 
according to this analysis we should rank bidders by 
virtual score esψ es vs to optimize revenue and exclude any 
bidders with negative virtual score however unlike in the 
incomplete information setting here we are constrained to 
ranking rules that correspond to a certain weighting scheme 
ws ≡ g es we remark that the virtual score cannot be 
reproduced exactly via a weighting scheme 
lemma there is no weighting scheme g such that the 
virtual score equals the score for any density f 
proof assume there is a g such that eψ e v g e v 
 the subscript s is suppressed for clarity this is equivalent 
to 
d 
dv 
log − f v e h e v 
where h e g e e− − 
 let ¯v be such that f ¯v e 
under the assumption of full support there is always such 
a ¯v integrating with respect to v from to ¯v we find 
that the left-hand side converges whereas the right-hand side 
diverges a contradiction 
of course to rank bidders by virtual score we only need 
g es vs h esψ es vs for some monotonically increasing 
transformation h a necessary condition for this is that 
ψ es vs be increasing in vs for all es absent this 
regularity condition the optimization problem seems quite difficult 
because it is so general we need to maximize expected 
revenue over the space of all functions g 
to simplify matters we now restrict our attention to the 
family of weights ws eq 
s for q ∈ −∞ ∞ it should be 
much simpler to find the optimum within this family since 
it is just one-dimensional note that it covers rank-by-bid 
 q and rank-by-revenue q as special cases 
to see how tuning q can improve matters consider again 
the equilibrium revenue 
r q 
kx 
s 
kx 
t s 
„ 
et 
es 
 q 
es xt − xt vt 
if the bidders are ranked in decreasing order of relevance 
then et 
es 
≤ for t s and decreasing q slightly without 
affecting the allocation will increase revenue similarly if 
bidders are ranked in increasing order of relevance 
increasing q slightly will yield an improvement now suppose there 
is perfect positive correlation between value and relevance 
in this case rank-by-bid will always lead to the same 
allocation as rank-by-revenue and bidders will always be ranked 
in decreasing order of relevance it then follows from that 
q will yield more revenue in equilibrium than q 
 
it may appear that this contradicts the revenue-equivalence 
theorem because mechanisms that always lead to the 
same allocation in equilibrium should yield the same 
revenue note though that with perfect correlation there are 
if a good estimate of f is available monte-carlo 
simulations can be used to estimate the revenue curve as a function 
of q and the optimum can be located simulations can also 
be used to quantify the effect of correlation on the location 
of the optimum we do this in section 
 efficiency and relevance 
in principle the revenue-optimal parameter q may lie 
anywhere in −∞ ∞ however tuning the ranking rule also 
has consequences for advertiser satisfaction and user 
experience and taking these into account reduces the range of 
allowable q 
the total relevance of the equilibrium allocation is 
l q 
kx 
s 
esxs 
i e the aggregate click-through rate presumably users find 
the ad display more interesting and less of a nuisance if 
they are more inclined to click on the ads so we adopt total 
relevance as a measure of user experience 
let ps 
ws 
ws 
bs be the price per click faced by bidder 
s the total value efficiency generated by the auction in 
equilibrium is 
v q 
kx 
s 
esxsvs 
 
kx 
s 
esxs vs − ps 
kx 
s 
esxsps 
as we see total value can be reinterpreted as total profits 
to the bidders and auctioneer combined since we only 
consider deviations from maximum efficiency that increase the 
auctioneer s profits any decrease in efficiency in our setting 
corresponds to a decrease in bidder profits we therefore 
adopt efficiency as a measure of advertiser satisfaction 
we would expect total relevance to increase with q since 
more weight is placed on each bidder s individual relevance 
we would expect efficiency to be maximized at q since 
in this case a bidder s weight is exactly his relevance 
proposition total relevance is non-decreasing in q 
proof recall that in symmetric equilibrium bidders are 
ranked in order of decreasing wsvs let perform an 
exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q 
starting from the ranking that arises with q for a description 
of exchange sort and its properties see knuth pp 
 assume that is large enough to make the rankings 
distinct agents s and t where s is initially ranked lower 
than t are swapped in the process if and only if the following 
conditions hold 
eq 
svs ≤ eq 
t vt 
eq 
s vs eq 
t vt 
which together imply that es et and hence es et as 
 at some point in the sort agent s occupies some slot 
α β such that vs αes β so the assumption of full 
support is violated which is necessary for revenue equivalence 
recall that a density has full support over a given domain 
if every point in the domain has positive density 
 
k while agent t occupies slot k − after the swap total 
relevance will have changed by the amount 
esxk− etxk − etxk− − esxk 
 es − et xk− − xk 
as relevance strictly increases with each swap in the sort 
total relevance is strictly greater when using q rather 
than q 
proposition total value is non-decreasing in q for 
q ≤ and non-increasing in q for q ≥ 
proof let q ≥ and let perform an exchange 
sort to obtain the second ranking from the first as in the 
previous proof if agents s and t are swapped where s was 
initially ranked lower than t then es et this follows by 
the same reasoning as in the previous proof now e −q 
s ≤ 
e −q 
t as − q ≤ this together with eq 
svs ≤ eq 
t vt implies 
that esvs ≤ etvt hence after swapping agents s and t total 
value has not increased the case for q ≤ is similar 
since the trends described in propositions and hold 
pointwise i e for any set of bidders they also hold in 
expectation proposition confirms that efficiency is indeed 
maximized at q 
these results motivate the following approach although 
tuning q can optimize current revenue this may come at the 
price of future revenue because advertisers and users may 
be lost seeing as their satisfaction decreases to guarantee 
future revenue will not be hurt too much the auctioneer 
can impose bounds on the percent efficiency and relevance 
loss he is willing to tolerate with q being a natural 
baseline by proposition a lower bound on efficiency will 
yield upper and lower bounds on the search space for q by 
proposition a lower bound on relevance will yield another 
lower bound on q the revenue curve can then be plotted 
within the allowable range of q to find the revenue-optimal 
setting 
 simulations 
to add a measure of reality to our simulations we fit 
distributions for value and relevance to yahoo bid and 
clickthrough rate data for a certain keyword that draws over a 
million searches per month we do not reveal the identity 
of the keyword to respect the privacy of the advertisers 
we obtained click and impression data for the advertisers 
bidding on the keyword from this we estimated advertiser 
and position effects using a maximum-likelihood criterion 
we found that indeed position effects are monotonically 
decreasing with lower rank we then fit a beta distribution 
to the advertiser effects resulting in parameters a 
and b 
we obtained bids of advertisers for the keyword using 
varian s technique we derived bounds on the bidders 
actual values given these bids by this technique upper and 
lower bounds are obtained on bidder values given the bids 
according to inequality if the interval for a given value is 
empty i e its upper bound lies below its lower bound then 
we compute the smallest perturbation to the bids necessary 
to make the interval non-empty which involves solving a 
quadratic program we found that the mean absolute 
deviation required to fit bids to symmetric equilibrium was

figure empirical marginal distributions of value 
and relevance 
always at most and usually significantly less over 
different days in a period of two weeks 
we fit a lognormal 
distribution to the lower bounds on the bidders values 
resulting in parameters μ and σ 
the empirical distributions of value and relevance together 
with the fitted lognormal and beta curves are given in 
figure it appears that mixtures of beta and lognormal 
distributions might be better fits but since these distributions 
are used mainly for illustration purposes we err on the side 
of simplicity 
we used a gaussian copula to create dependence between 
value and relevance 
given the marginal distributions for 
value and relevance together with this copula we simulated 
the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of 
spearman correlation with slots and bidders the results 
are shown in figure 
it is apparent from the figure that the optimal choice of q 
moves to the right as correlation decreases this agrees with 
our intuition from section the choice is very sensitive 
to the level of correlation if choosing only between 
rankby-bid and rank-by-revenue rank-by-bid is best for positive 
correlation whereas rank-by-revenue is best for negative 
correlation at zero correlation they give about the same 
expected revenue in this instance figure also shows that 
in principle the optimal q may be negative it may also 
occur beyond for different distributions but we do not 
know if these would be realistic the trends in efficiency 
and relevance are as described in the results from section 
 any small deviation from these trends is due to the 
randomness inherent in the simulations the curves level off 
as q → ∞ because eventually agents are ranked purely 
according to relevance and similarly as q → −∞ 
a typical spearman correlation between value and 
relevance for the keyword was about -for different days in 
a week the correlation lay within simulation 
results with this correlation are in figure in this instance 
rank-by-bid is in fact optimal yielding more revenue 
than rank-by-revenue however at q efficiency and 
relevance are and lower than at q respectively 
imposing a bound of say on efficiency and relevance loss 
from the baseline at q the optimal setting is q 
yielding more revenue than the baseline 
 
see varian for a definition of mean absolute deviation 
 
a copula is a function that takes marginal distributions 
and gives a joint distribution with these marginals it can 
be designed so that the variables are correlated see for 
example nelsen 
 
the y-axes in figures - have been normalized because 
the simulations are based on proprietary data only relative 
values are meaningful

figure revenue efficiency and relevance for different parameters q with spearman correlation 
of estimated standard errors are less than of the values shown 
we also looked into the effect of introducing a reserve 
score results are shown in figure naturally both 
efficiency and relevance suffer with an increasing reserve score 
the optimal setting is r which gives only an 
increase in revenue from r however it results in a 
efficiency loss and a relevance loss tuning weights 
seems to be a much more desirable approach than 
introducing a reserve score in this instance 
the reason why efficiency and relevance suffer more with 
a reserve score is that this approach will often exclude 
bidders entirely whereas this never occurs when tuning weights 
the two approaches are not mutually exclusive however 
and some combination of the two might prove better than 
either alone although we did not investigate this possibility 
 conclusions 
in this work we looked into the revenue properties of a 
family of ranking rules that contains the yahoo and google 
models as special cases in practice it should be very 
simple to move between rules within the family this simply 
involves changing the exponent q applied to advertiser effects 
we also showed that in principle the same effect could be 
obtained by using bidding credits despite the simplicity 
of the rule change simulations revealed that properly 
tuning q can significantly improve revenue in the simulations 
the revenue improvements were greater than what could be 
obtained using reserve prices 
on the other hand we showed that advertiser 
satisfaction and user experience could suffer if q is made too small 
we proposed that the auctioneer set bounds on the decrease 
in advertiser and user satisfaction he is willing to tolerate 
which would imply bounds on the range of allowable q with 
appropriate estimates for the distributions of value and 
relevance and knowledge of their correlation the revenue curve 
can then be plotted within this range to locate the optimum 
there are several ways to push this research further it 
would be interesting to do this analysis for a variety of 
keywords to see if the optimal setting of q is always so sensitive 
to the level of correlation if it is then simply using 
rank-bybid where there is positive correlation and rank-by-revenue 
where there is negative correlation could be fine to a first 
approximation and already improve revenue it would also be 
interesting to compare the effects of tuning q versus reserve 
pricing for keywords that have few bidders in this instance 
reserve pricing should be more competitive but this is still 
an open question 
in principle the minimum revenue in nash equilibrium 
can be found by linear programming however many 
allocations can arise in nash equilibrium and a linear program 
needs to be solved for each of these there is as yet no 
efficient way to enumerate all possible nash allocations so 
finding the minimum revenue is currently infeasible if this 
problem could be solved we could run simulations for nash 
equilibrium instead of symmetric equilibrium to see if our 
insights are robust to the choice of solution concept 
larger classes of ranking rules could be relevant for 
instance it is possible to introduce discounts ds and rank 
according to wsbs − ds the equilibrium analysis generalizes to 
this case as well with this larger class the virtual score 
can equal the score e g in the case of a uniform marginal 
distribution over values it is unclear though whether such 
extensions help with more realistic distributions
