traditional mobile ad-hoc network manet routing protocols 
assume that contemporaneous end-to-end communication paths exist 
between data senders and receivers in some mobile ad-hoc 
networks with a sparse node population an end-to-end 
communication path may break frequently or may not exist at any time many 
routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the 
problem but few were evaluated in a realistic opportunistic 
network setting we use simulation and contact traces derived from 
logs in a production network to evaluate and compare five 
existing protocols direct-delivery epidemic random prophet and 
link-state as well as our own proposed routing protocol we show 
that the direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either 
low delivery ratio or high resource usage and other protocols make 
tradeoffs between delivery ratio and resource usage

 introduction 
mobile opportunistic networks are one kind of delay-tolerant 
network dtn delay-tolerant networks provide service 
despite long link delays or frequent link breaks long link delays 
happen in networks with communication between nodes at a great 
distance such as interplanetary networks link breaks are caused 
by nodes moving out of range environmental changes interference 
from other moving objects radio power-offs or failed nodes for 
us mobile opportunistic networks are those dtns with sparse node 
population and frequent link breaks caused by power-offs and the 
mobility of the nodes 
mobile opportunistic networks have received increasing interest 
from researchers in the literature these networks include mobile 
sensor networks wild-animal tracking networks 
pocketswitched networks and transportation networks we 
expect to see more opportunistic networks when the 
one-laptopper-child olpc project starts rolling out inexpensive 
laptops with wireless networking capability for children in developing 
countries where often no infrastructure exits opportunistic 
networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange 
information 
one fundamental problem in opportunistic networks is how to 
route messages from their source to their destination mobile 
opportunistic networks differ from the internet in that disconnections 
are the norm instead of the exception in mobile opportunistic 
networks communication devices can be carried by people 
vehicles or animals some devices can form a small mobile 
ad-hoc network when the nodes move close to each other but a 
node may frequently be isolated from other nodes note that 
traditional internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols such 
as aodv or dsdv assume that a contemporaneous 
endto-end path exists and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks 
indeed there may never exist an end-to-end path between two given 
devices 
in this paper we study protocols for routing messages between 
wireless networking devices carried by people we assume that 
people send messages to other people occasionally using their 
devices when no direct link exists between the source and the 
destination of the message other nodes may relay the message to the 
destination each device represents a unique person it is out of the 
scope of this paper when a device maybe carried by multiple 
people each message is destined for a specific person and thus for 
a specific node carried by that person although one person may 
carry multiple devices we assume that the sender knows which 
device is the best to receive the message we do not consider 
multicast or geocast in this paper 
many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature 
few of them were evaluated in realistic network settings or even in 
realistic simulations due to the lack of any realistic people 
mobility model random walk or random way-point mobility models are 
often used to evaluate the performance of those routing protocols 
although these synthetic mobility models have received extensive 
interest by mobile ad-hoc network researchers they do not 
reflect people s mobility patterns realising the limitations of 
using random mobility models in simulations a few researchers have 
studied routing protocols in mobile opportunistic networks with 
realistic mobility traces chaintreau et al theoretically analyzed 
the impact of routing algorithms over a model derived from a 
realistic mobility data set su et al simulated a set of routing 
 
protocols in a small experimental network those studies help 
researchers better understand the theoretical limits of opportunistic 
networks and the routing protocol performance in a small network 
 - nodes 
deploying and experimenting large-scale mobile opportunistic 
networks is difficult we too resort to simulation instead of 
using a complex mobility model to mimic people s mobility patterns 
we used mobility traces collected in a production wireless 
network at dartmouth college to drive our simulation our 
messagegeneration model however was synthetic 
to the best of our knowledge we are the first to simulate the 
effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic 
network using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of 
a production network with more than users 
using realistic contact traces we evaluate the performance of 
three naive routing protocols direct-delivery epidemic and 
random and two prediction-based routing protocols prophet 
and link-state we also propose a new prediction-based 
routing protocol and compare it to the above in our evaluation 
 routing protocol 
a routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one 
node source to another node destination any node may 
generate messages for any other node and may carry messages destined 
for other nodes in this paper we consider only messages that are 
unicast single destination 
dtn routing protocols could be described in part by their 
transfer probability and replication probability that is when one node 
meets another node what is the probability that a message should 
be transfered and if so whether the sender should retain its copy 
two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic 
protocol the former transfers with probability when the node 
meets the destination for others and no replication the latter 
uses transfer probability for all nodes and unlimited replication 
both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages all 
other protocols are between the two extremes 
first we define the notion of contact between two nodes then 
we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own 
proposal 
a contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes 
have the opportunity to communicate although we are aware that 
wireless technologies differ we assume that a node can reliably 
detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes 
a node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time 
the contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other 
nodes node i has a contact history hi j for each other node j 
which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j 
we record the start and end time for each contact however the last 
contacts in the node s contact history may not have ended 
 direct delivery protocol 
in this simple protocol a message is transmitted only when the 
source node can directly communicate with the destination node 
of the message in mobile opportunistic networks however the 
probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low or 
even zero 
 epidemic routing protocol 
the epidemic routing protocol floods messages into the 
network the source node sends a copy of the message to every node 
that it meets the nodes that receive a copy of the message also 
send a copy of the message to every node that they meet 
eventually a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message 
this protocol is simple but may use significant resources 
excessive communication may drain each node s battery quickly 
moreover since each node keeps a copy of each message storage is not 
used efficiently and the capacity of the network is limited 
at a minimum each node must expire messages after some amount 
of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops 
after a message expires the message will not be transmitted and will 
be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message 
an optimization to reduce the communication cost is to 
transfer index messages before transferring any data message the 
index messages contain ids of messages that a node currently holds 
thus by examining the index messages a node only transfers 
messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes 
 random routing 
an obvious approach between the above two extremes is to 
select a transfer probability between and to forward messages at 
each contact we use a simple replication strategy that allows only 
the source node to make replicas and limits the replication to a 
specific number of copies the message has some chance of 
being transferred to a highly mobile node and thus may have a better 
chance to reach its destination before the message expires 
 prophet protocol 
prophet is a probabilistic routing protocol using history 
of past encounters and transitivity to estimate each node s delivery 
probability for each other node when node i meets node j the 
delivery probability of node i for j is updated by 
pij − pij p pij 
where p is an initial probability a design parameter for a given 
network lindgren et al chose as did we in our 
evaluation when node i does not meet j for some time the delivery 
probability decreases by 
pij αk 
pij 
where α is the aging factor α and k is the number of time 
units since the last update 
the prophet protocol exchanges index messages as well as 
delivery probabilities when node i receives node j s delivery 
probabilities node i may compute the transitive delivery probability 
through j to z with 
piz piz − piz pijpjzβ 
where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity we 
used β as did lindgren 
 link-state protocol 
su et al use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of 
each path from the source of a message to the destination they 
use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged 
intercontact duration as the weight on links the exponentially aged 
inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by 
wij αwij − α i 
where i is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor 
nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate 
with each other and messages are forwarded to the node that have 
the path with the lowest link-state weight 
 
 timely-contact probability 
we also use historical contact information to estimate the 
probability of meeting other nodes in the future but our method differs 
in that we estimate the contact probability within a period of time 
for example what is the contact probability in the next hour 
neither prophet nor link-state considers time in this way 
one way to estimate the timely-contact probability is to use the 
ratio of the total contact duration to the total time however this 
approach does not capture the frequency of contacts for example 
one node may have a long contact with another node followed by 
a long non-contact period a third node may have a short contact 
with the first node followed by a short non-contact period using 
the above estimation approach both examples would have similar 
contact probability in the second example however the two nodes 
have more frequent contacts 
we design a method to capture the contact frequency of mobile 
nodes for this purpose we assume that even short contacts are 
sufficient to exchange messages 
the probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the 
following procedure we divide the contact history hi j into a 
sequence of n periods of δt starting from the start time t of the 
first contact in history hi j to the current time we number each 
of the n periods from to n − then check each period if node 
i had any contact with node j during a given period m which is 
 t mδt t m δt we set the contact status im to be 
 otherwise the contact status im is the probability p 
 
ij that 
node i meets node j in the next δt can be estimated as the average 
of the contact status in prior intervals

n− x 
m 
im 
to adapt to the change of contact patterns and reduce the storage 
space for contact histories a node may discard old history contacts 
in this situation the estimate would be based on only the retained 
history 
the above probability is the direct contact probability of two 
nodes we are also interested in the probability that we may be 
able to pass a message through a sequence of k nodes we define 
the k-order probability inductively

 our routing protocol 
we first consider the case of a two-hop path that is with only 
one relay node we consider two approaches either the receiving 
neighbor decides whether to act as a relay or the source decides 
which neighbors to use as relay 
 receiver decision 
whenever a node meets other nodes they exchange all their 
messages or as above index messages if the destination of a 
message is the receiver itself the message is delivered otherwise if 
the probability of delivering the message to its destination through 
this receiver node within δt is greater than or equal to a certain 
threshold the message is stored in the receiver s storage to forward 
 
in our simulation however we accurately model the 
communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of 
all messages 
to the destination if the probability is less than the threshold the 
receiver discards the message notice that our protocol replicates 
the message whenever a good-looking relay comes along 
 sender decision 
to make decisions a sender must have the information about its 
neighbors contact probability with a message s destination 
therefore meta-data exchange is necessary 
when two nodes meet they exchange a meta-message 
containing an unordered list of node ids for which the sender of the 
metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold 
after receiving a meta-message a node checks whether it has 
any message that destined to its neighbor or to a node in the node 
list of the neighbor s meta-message if it has it sends a copy of the 
message 
when a node receives a message if the destination of the 
message is the receiver itself the message is delivered otherwise the 
message is stored in the receiver s storage for forwarding to the 
destination 
 multi-node relay 
when we use more than two hops to relay a message each node 
needs to know the contact probabilities along all possible paths to 
the message destination 
every node keeps a contact probability matrix in which each cell 
pij is a contact probability between to nodes i and j each node 
i computes its own contact probabilities row i with other nodes 
using equation whenever the node ends a contact with other 
nodes each row of the contact probability matrix has a version 
number the version number for row i is only increased when node i 
updates the matrix entries in row i other matrix entries are updated 
through exchange with other nodes when they meet 
when two nodes i and j meet they first exchange their contact 
probability matrices node i compares its own contact matrix with 
node j s matrix if node j s matrix has a row l with a higher version 
number then node i replaces its own row l with node j s row l 
likewise node j updates its matrix after the exchange the two 
nodes will have identical contact probability matrices 
next if a node has a message to forward the node estimates 
its neighboring node s order-k contact probability to contact the 
destination of the message using equation if p 
 k 
ij is above a 
threshold or if j is the destination of the message node i will send 
a copy of the message to node j 
all the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability 
when two nodes meet the replication decision is orthogonal to 
the transfer decision in our implementation we always replicate 
although prophet and link-state do no replication as 
described we added replication to those protocols for better 
comparison to our protocol 
 evaluation results 
we evaluate and compare the results of direct delivery epidemic 
random prophet link-state and timely-contact routing 
protocols 
 mobility traces 
we use real mobility data collected at dartmouth college 
dartmouth college has collected association and disassociation 
messages from devices on its wireless network wireless users since 
spring each message records the wireless card mac 
address the time of association disassociation and the name of the 
access point we treat each unique mac address as a node for 
 
more information about dartmouth s network and the data 
collection see previous studies 
our data are not contacts in a mobile ad-hoc network we can 
approximate contact traces by assuming that two users can 
communicate with each other whenever they are associated with the same 
access point chaintreau et al used dartmouth data traces and 
made the same assumption to theoretically analyze the impact of 
human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms this 
assumption may not be accurate 
but it is a good first approximation 
in our simulation we imagine the same clients and same mobility 
in a network with no access points since our campus has full wifi 
coverage we assume that the location of access points had little 
impact on users mobility 
we simulated one full month of trace data november 
taken from crawdad with users although 
predictionbased protocols require prior contact history to estimate each node s 
delivery probability our preliminary results show that the 
performance improvement of warming-up over one month of trace was 
marginal therefore for simplicity we show the results of all 
protocols without warming-up 
 simulator 
we developed a custom simulator 
since we used contact traces 
derived from real mobility data we did not need a mobility model 
and omitted physical and link-layer details for node discovery we 
were aware that the time for neighbor discovery in different 
wireless technologies vary from less than one seconds to several 
seconds furthermore connection establishment also takes time such 
as dhcp in our simulation we assumed the nodes could discover 
and connect each other instantly when they were associated with a 
same ap to accurately model communication costs however we 
simulated some mac-layer behaviors such as collision 
the default settings of the network of our simulator are listed in 
table using the values recommended by other papers 
the message probability was the probability of generating 
messages as described in section the default transmission 
bandwidth was mb s when one node tried to transmit a message it 
first checked whether any nearby node was transmitting if it was 
the node backed off a random number of slots each slot was 
millisecond and the maximum number of backoff slots was the 
size of messages was uniformly distributed between bytes and 
 bytes the hop count limit hcl was the maximum number 
of hops before a message should stop forwarding the time to live 
 ttl was the maximum duration that a message may exist before 
expiring the storage capacity was the maximum space that a node 
can use for storing messages for our routing method we used a 
default prediction window δt of hours and a probability 
threshold of the replication factor r was not limited by default so 
the source of a message transferred the messages to any other node 
that had a contact probability with the message destination higher 
than the probability threshold 
 message generation 
after each contact event in the contact trace we generated a 
message with a given probability we choose a source node and a 
des 
two nodes may not have been able to directly communicate while 
they were at two far sides of an access point or two nodes may 
have been able to directly communicate if they were between two 
adjacent access points 
 
we tried to use a general network simulator ns which was 
extremely slow when simulating a large number of mobile nodes in 
our case more than nodes and provided unnecessary detail 
in modeling lower-level network protocols

similar patterns that is people send more messages during the day

 meta-data transmissions the total number of meta-data units

figure shows the delivery ratio of all the protocols with

method state stands for the link-state protocol and prophet 
represents prophet although we had users in the 
network the direct-delivery and random protocols had low delivery 
ratios note the log scale even for messages with an unlimited 
lifetime only out of messages were delivered during this 
one-month simulation the delivery ratio of epidemic routing was 
the best the three prediction-based approaches had low delivery 
ratio compared to epidemic routing although our method was 
slightly better than the other two the advantage was marginal 
the high delivery ratio of epidemic routing came with a price 
excessive transmissions figure shows the number of message 
data transmissions the number of message transmissions of 
epidemic routing was more than times higher than for the 
predictionbased routing protocols obviously the direct delivery protocol 
had the lowest number of message transmissions - the number of 
message delivered among the three prediction-based methods 
the prophet transmitted fewer messages but had comparable 
delivery-ratio as seen in figure 
figure shows that epidemic and all prediction-based methods 
had substantial meta-data transmissions though epidemic routing 
had relatively more with shorter ttls because epidemic 
protocol transmitted messages at every contact in turn more nodes had 
messages that required meta-data transmission during contact the 
direct-delivery and random protocols had no meta-data 
transmissions 
in addition to its message transmissions and meta-data 
transmissions the epidemic routing protocol also had excessive message

duplications 
figure shows both the median and mean delivery delays all 
protocols show similar delivery delays in both mean and median 
measures for medium ttls but differ for long and short ttls 
with a -hour ttl or unlimited ttl epidemic routing had the 
shortest delays the direct-delivery had the longest delay for 
unlimited ttl but it had the shortest delay for the one-hour ttl 
the results seem contrary to our intuition the epidemic routing 
protocol should be the fastest routing protocol since it spreads 
messages all over the network indeed the figures show only the delay 
time for delivered messages for direct delivery random and the 
probability-based routing protocols relatively few messages were 
delivered for short ttls so many messages expired before they 
could reach their destination those messages had infinite delivery 
delay and were not included in the median or mean measurements 
for longer ttls more messages were delivered even for the 
directdelivery protocol the statistics of longer ttls for comparison are 
more meaningful than those of short ttls 
since our message generation rate was low the storage usage 
was also low in our simulation figure shows the maximum

sensitive to several parameters such as the probability threshold and the 
prediction window δt figure shows the delivery ratios when 
we used different probability thresholds the leftmost value 
is the value used for the other plots a higher probability threshold 
limited the transfer probability so fewer messages were delivered 
it also required fewer transmissions as shown in figure with 
a larger prediction window we got a higher contact probability 
thus for the same probability threshold we had a slightly higher 
delivery ratio as shown in figure and a few more transmissions 
as shown in figure 
 related work 
in addition to the protocols that we evaluated in our simulation 
several other opportunistic network routing protocols have been 
proposed in the literature we did not implement and evaluate these 
routing protocols because either they require domain-specific 
information location information assume certain mobility 
patterns present orthogonal approaches to other 
routing protocols

lebrun et al propose a location-based delay-tolerant 
network routing protocol their algorithm assumes that every node 
knows its own position and the destination is stationary at a known 
location a node forwards data to a neighbor only if the 
neighbor is closer to the destination than its own position our protocol 
does not require knowledge of the nodes locations and learns their 
contact patterns 
leguay et al use a high-dimensional space to represent a 
mobility pattern then routes messages to nodes that are closer to 
the destination node in the mobility pattern space location 
information of nodes is required to construct mobility patterns 
musolesi et al propose an adaptive routing protocol for 
intermittently connected mobile ad-hoc networks they use a kalman 
filter to compute the probability that a node delivers messages this 
protocol assumes group mobility and cloud connectivity that is 
nodes move as a group and among this group of nodes a 
contemporaneous end-to-end connection exists for every pair of nodes when 
two nodes are in the same connected cloud dsdv routing is 
used 
network coding also draws much interest from dtn research 
erasure-coding explores coding algorithms to reduce 
message replicas the source node replicates a message m times then 
uses a coding scheme to encode them in one big message 
after replicas are encoded the source divides the big message into k

 summary 
we propose a prediction-based routing protocol for 
opportunistic networks we evaluate the performance of our protocol using 
realistic contact traces and compare to five existing routing 
protocols 
our simulation results show that direct delivery had the 
lowest delivery ratio the fewest data transmissions and no meta-data 
transmission or data duplication direct delivery is suitable for 
devices that require an extremely low power consumption the 
random protocol increased the chance of delivery for messages 
otherwise stuck at some low mobility nodes epidemic routing delivered 
the most messages the excessive transmissions and data 
duplication however consume more resources than portable devices may 
be able to provide 
none of these protocols direct-delivery random and epidemic 
routing are practical for real deployment of opportunistic networks

figure prediction window impact on message transmission 
of timely-contact routing semi-log scale 
because they either had an extremely low delivery ratio or had an 
extremely high resource consumption the prediction-based 
routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than times better than 
that for direct-delivery and random routing and fewer 
transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing they also had 
fewer data duplications than epidemic routing 
all the prediction-based routing protocols that we have 
evaluated had similar performance our method had a slightly higher 
delivery ratio but more transmissions and higher storage usage 
there are many parameters for prediction-based routing protocols 
however and different parameters may produce different results 
indeed there is an opportunity for some adaptation for example 
high priority messages may be given higher transfer and 
replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the 
delay or a node with infrequent contact may choose to raise its 
transfer probability 
we only studied the impact of predicting peer-to-peer contact 
probability for routing in unicast messages in some applications 
context information such as location may be available for the 
peers one may also consider other messaging models for 
example where messages are sent to a location such that every node at 
that location will receive a copy of the message location 
prediction may be used to predict nodes mobility and to choose as 
relays those nodes moving toward the destined location 
research on routing in opportunistic networks is still in its early 
stage many other issues of opportunistic networks such as 
security and privacy are mainly left open we anticipate studying these 
issues in future work
