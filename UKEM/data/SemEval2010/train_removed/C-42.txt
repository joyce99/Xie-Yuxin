abstract 
ensemble kalman filter data assimilation methodology is a 
popular approach for hydrocarbon reservoir simulations in energy 
exploration in this approach an ensemble of geological models 
and production data of oil fields is used to forecast the dynamic 
response of oil wells the schlumberger eclipse software is 
used for these simulations since models in the ensemble do not 
communicate message-passing implementation is a good choice 
each model checks out an eclipse license and therefore 
parallelizability of reservoir simulations depends on the number 
licenses available we have grid-enabled the ensemble kalman 
filter data assimilation methodology for the tigre grid 
computing environment by pooling the licenses and computing 
resources across the collaborating institutions using gridway 
metascheduler and tigre environment the computational 
accuracy can be increased while reducing the simulation runtime 
in this paper we provide an account of our efforts in 
gridenabling the ensemble kalman filter data assimilation 
methodology potential benefits of this approach observations 
and lessons learned will be discussed

 introduction 
grid computing is an emerging collaborative 
computing paradigm to extend institution organization 
specific high performance computing hpc capabilities 
greatly beyond local resources its importance stems from 
the fact that ground breaking research in strategic 
application areas such as bioscience and medicine energy 
exploration and environmental modeling involve strong 
interdisciplinary components and often require intercampus 
collaborations and computational capabilities beyond 
institutional limitations 
the texas internet grid for research and education 
 tigre is a state funded cyberinfrastructure 
development project carried out by five rice a m ttu 
uh and ut austin major university systems - collectively 
called tigre institutions the purpose of tigre is to 
create a higher education grid to sustain and extend 
research and educational opportunities across texas 
tigre is a project of the high performance computing 
across texas hipcat consortium the goal of 
hipcat is to support advanced computational technologies 
to enhance research development and educational 
activities 
the primary goal of tigre is to design and deploy 
state-of-the-art grid middleware that enables integration of 
computing systems storage systems and databases 
visualization laboratories and displays and even 
instruments and sensors across texas the secondary goal 
is to demonstrate the tigre capabilities to enhance 
research and educational opportunities in strategic 
application areas of interest to the state of texas these are 
bioscience and medicine energy exploration and air quality 
modeling vision of the tigre project is to foster 
interdisciplinary and intercampus collaborations identify 
novel approaches to extend academic-government-private 
partnerships and become a competitive model for external 
funding opportunities the overall goal of tigre is to 
support local campus and regional user interests and offer 
avenues to connect with national grid projects such as 
open science grid and teragrid 
within the energy exploration strategic application area 
we have grid-enabled the ensemble kalman filter enkf 
 approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and 
demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the 
tigre environment and the gridway metascheduler 
section provides an overview of the tigre environment 
and capabilities application description and the need for 
grid-enabling enkf methodology is provided in section 
the implementation details and merits of our approach are 
discussed in section conclusions are provided in section 
 finally observations and lessons learned are documented 
in section 
 tigre environment 
the tigre grid middleware consists of minimal set of 
components derived from a subset of the virtual data 
toolkit vdt which supports a variety of operating 
systems the purpose of choosing a minimal software stack 
is to support applications at hand and to simplify 
installation and distribution of client server stacks across 
tigre sites additional components will be added as they 
become necessary the pacman packaging and 
distribution mechanism is employed for tigre 
client server installation and management the pacman 
distribution mechanism involves retrieval installation and 
often configuration of the packaged software this 
approach allows the clients to keep current consistent 
versions of tigre software it also helps tigre sites to 
install the needed components on resources distributed 
throughout the participating sites the tigre client server 
stack consists of an authentication and authorization layer 
globus gram -based job submission via web services 
 pre-web services installations are available up on request 
the tools for handling grid proxy generation grid-enabled 
file transfer and grid-enabled remote login are supported 
the pertinent details of tigre services and tools for job 
scheduling and management are provided below 
 certificate authority 
the tigre security infrastructure includes a certificate 
authority ca accredited by the international grid trust 
federation igtf for issuing x user and resource 
grid certificates the texas advanced computing 
center tacc university of texas at austin is the 
tigre s shared ca the tigre institutions serve as 
registration authorities ra for their respective local user 
base for up-to-date information on securing user and 
resource certificates and their installation instructions see 
ref the users and hosts on tigre are identified by 
their distinguished name dn in their x certificate 
provided by the ca a native grid-mapfile that contains a 
list of authorized dns is used to authenticate and authorize 
user job scheduling and management on tigre site 
resources at texas tech university the users are 
dynamically allocated one of the many generic pool 
accounts this is accomplished through the grid user 
management system gums 
 job scheduling and management 
the tigre environment supports gram -based job 
submission via web services the job submission scripts are 
generated using xml the web services gram translates 
the xml scripts into target cluster specific batch schedulers 
such as lsf pbs or sge the high bandwidth file transfer 
protocols such as gridftp are utilized for staging files in 
and out of the target machine the login to remote hosts for 
compilation and debugging is only through gsissh service 
which requires resource authentication through x 
certificates the authentication and authorization of grid 
jobs are managed by issuing grid certificates to both users 
and hosts the certificate revocation lists crl are 
updated on a daily basis to maintain high security standards 
of the tigre grid services the tigre portal 
documentation area provides a quick start tutorial on 
running jobs on tigre 
 metascheduler 
the metascheduler interoperates with the cluster level 
batch schedulers such as lsf pbs in the overall grid 
workflow management in the present work we have 
employed gridway metascheduler - a globus incubator 
project - to schedule and manage jobs across tigre 
the gridway is a light-weight metascheduler that fully 
utilizes globus functionalities it is designed to provide 
efficient use of dynamic grid resources by multiple users 
for grid infrastructures built on top of globus services the 
tigre site administrator can control the resource sharing 
through a powerful built-in scheduler provided by gridway 
or by extending gridway s external scheduling module to 
provide their own scheduling policies application users 
can write job descriptions using gridway s simple and 
direct job template format see section for details or 
standard job submission description language jsdl 
see section for implementation details 
 customer service management system 
a tigre portal was designed and deployed to interface 
users and resource providers it was designed using 
gridport and is maintained by tacc the tigre 
environment is supported by open source tools such as the 
open ticket request system otrs for servicing 
trouble tickets and moinmoin wiki for tigre 
content and knowledge management for education outreach 
and training the links for otrs and wiki are consumed 
by the tigre portal - the gateway for users and 
resource providers the tigre resource status and loads 
are monitored by the grid port information repository 
 gpir service of the gridport toolkit which interfaces 
with local cluster load monitoring service such as ganglia 
the gpir utilizes cron jobs on each resource to gather 
site specific resource characteristics such as jobs that are 
running queued and waiting for resource allocation 
 ensemble kalman filter 
application 
the main goal of hydrocarbon reservoir simulations is to 
forecast the production behavior of oil and gas field 
 denoted as field hereafter for its development and optimal 
management in reservoir modeling the field is divided into 
several geological models as shown in figure for 
accurate performance forecasting of the field it is necessary 
to reconcile several geological models to the dynamic 
response of the field through history matching - 
figure cross-sectional view of the field vertical 
layers correspond to different geological models and the 
nails are oil wells whose historical information will be 
used for forecasting the production behavior 
 figure ref http faculty smu edu zchen research html 
the enkf is a monte carlo method that works with an 
ensemble of reservoir models this method utilizes 
crosscovariances between the field measurements and the 
reservoir model parameters derived from several models 
to estimate prediction uncertainties the geological model 
parameters in the ensemble are sequentially updated with a 
goal to minimize the prediction uncertainties historical 
production response of the field for over years is used in 
these simulations the main advantage of enkf is that it 
can be readily linked to any reservoir simulator and can 
assimilate latest production data without the need to re-run 
the simulator from initial conditions researchers in texas 
are large subscribers of the schlumberger eclipse 
package for reservoir simulations in the reservoir 
modeling each geological model checks out an eclipse 
license the simulation runtime of the enkf methodology 
depends on the number of geological models used number 
of eclipse licenses available production history of the 
field and propagated uncertainties in history matching 
the overall enkf workflow is shown figure 
figure ensemble kaman filter data assimilation 
workflow each site has l licenses 
at start the master control process enkf main 
program reads the simulation configuration file for number 
 n of models and model-specific input files then n 
working directories are created to store the output files at 
the end of iteration the master control process collects the 
output files from n models and post processes 
crosscovariances to estimate the prediction uncertainties 
this information will be used to update models or input 
files for the next iteration the simulation continues until 
the production histories are exhausted 
typical enkf simulation with n and field histories 
of - years in time steps ranging from three months to a 
year takes about three weeks on a serial computing 
environment 
in parallel computing environment there is no 
interprocess communication between the geological models 
in the ensemble however at the end of each simulation 
time-step model-specific output files are to be collected for 
analyzing cross covariances and to prepare next set of 
input files therefore master-slave model in 
messagepassing mpi environment is a suitable paradigm in this 
approach the geological models are treated as slaves and 
are distributed across the available processors the master 
cluster or tigre gridway

end 
 
process collects model-specific output files analyzes and 
prepares next set of input files for the simulation since 
each geological model checks out an eclipse license 
parallelizability of the simulation depends on the number of 
licenses available when the available number of licenses is 
less than the number of models in the ensemble one or 
more of the nodes in the mpi group have to handle more 
than one model in a serial fashion and therefore it takes 
longer to complete the simulation 
a petroleum engineering department usually procures 
 - eclipse licenses while at least ten-fold increase in 
the number of licenses would be necessary for industry 
standard simulations the number of licenses can be 
increased by involving several petroleum engineering 
departments that support eclipse package 
since mpi does not scale very well for applications that 
involve remote compute clusters and to get around the 
firewall issues with license servers across administrative 
domains grid-enabling the enkf workflow seems to be 
necessary with this motivation we have implemented 
grid-enabled enkf workflow for the tigre environment 
and demonstrated parallelizability of the application across 
tigre using gridway metascheduler further details are 
provided in the next section 
 implementation details 
to grid-enable the enkf approach we have eliminated 
the mpi code for parallel processing and replaced with n 
single processor jobs or sub-jobs where n is the number 
of geological models in the ensemble these model-specific 
sub-jobs were distributed across tigre sites that support 
eclipse package using the gridway metascheduler 
for each sub-job we have constructed a gridway job 
template that specifies the executable input and output 
files and resource requirements since the tigre compute 
resources are not expected to change frequently we have 
used static resource discovery policy for gridway and the 
sub-jobs were scheduled dynamically across the tigre 
resources using gridway figure represents the sub-job 
template file for the gridway metascheduler 
figure gridway sub-job template 
in figure requirements flag is set to choose the 
resources that satisfy the application requirements in the 
case of enkf application for example we need resources 
that support eclipse package arguments flag 
specifies the model in the ensemble that will invoke 
eclipse at a remote site input files is prepared by 
the enkf main program or master control process and is 
transferred by gridway to the remote site where it is 
untared and is prepared for execution finally 
output files specifies the name and location where the 
output files are to be written 
the command-line features of gridway were used to 
collect and process the model-specific outputs to prepare 
new set of input files this step mimics mpi process 
synchronization in master-slave model at the end of each 
iteration the compute resources and licenses are committed

in ref 
we have demonstrated the grid-enabled enkf runs 
using gridway for tigre environment the jobs are so 
chosen that the runtime doesn t exceed more than a half 
hour the simulation runs involved up to jobs between 
a m and ttu sites with ttu serving licenses for 
resource information see table i 
one of the main advantages of grid-enabled enkf 
simulation is that both the resources and licenses are 
released back to the pool at the end of each simulation time 
step unlike in the case of mpi implementation where 
licenses and nodes are locked until the completion of entire 
simulation however the fact that each sub-job gets 
scheduled independently via gridway could possibly incur 
another time delay caused by waiting in queue for execution 
in each simulation time step such delays are not expected

in mpi implementation where the node is blocked for 
processing sub-jobs model-specific calculation until the 
end of the simulation there are two main scenarios for 
comparing grid and cluster computing approaches 
scenario i the cluster is heavily loaded the conceived 
average waiting time of job requesting large number of 
cpus is usually longer than waiting time of jobs requesting 
single cpu therefore overall waiting time could be 
shorter in grid approach which requests single cpu for 
each sub-job many times compared to mpi implementation 
that requests large number of cpus at a single time it is 
apparent that grid scheduling is beneficial especially when 
cluster is heavily loaded and requested number of cpus for 
the mpi job is not readily available 
scenario ii the cluster is relatively less loaded or 
largely available it appears the mpi implementation is 
favorable compared to the grid scheduling however 
parallelizability of the enkf application depends on the 
number of eclipse licenses and ideally the number of 
licenses should be equal to the number of models in the 
ensemble therefore if a single institution does not have 
sufficient number of licenses the cluster availability doesn t 
help as much as it is expected 
since the collaborative environment such as tigre can 
address both compute and software resource requirements 
for the enkf application grid-enabled approach is still 
advantageous over the conventional mpi implementation in 
any of the above scenarios 
 conclusions and future work 
tigre is a higher education grid development project 
and its purpose is to sustain and extend research and 
educational opportunities across texas within the energy 
exploration application area we have grid-enabled the mpi 
implementation of the ensemble kalman filter data 
assimilation methodology for reservoir characterization 
this task was accomplished by removing mpi code for 
parallel processing and replacing with single processor jobs 
one for each geological model in the ensemble these 
single processor jobs were scheduled across tigre via 
gridway metascheduler we have demonstrated that by 
pooling licenses across tigre sites more geological 
models can be handled in parallel and therefore conceivably 
better simulation accuracy this approach has several 
advantages over mpi implementation especially when a site 
specific cluster is heavily loaded and or the number licenses 
required for the simulation is more than those available at a 
single site 
towards the future work it would be interesting to 
compare the runtime between mpi and grid 
implementations for the enkf application this effort could 
shed light on quality of service qos of grid environments 
in comparison with cluster computing 
another aspect of interest in the near future would be 
managing both compute and license resources to address 
the job or processor -to-license ratio management 
 observations and lessions 
learned 
the grid-enabling efforts for enkf application have 
provided ample opportunities to gather insights on the 
visibility and promise of grid computing environments for 
application development and support the main issues are 
industry standard data security and qos comparable to 
cluster computing 
since the reservoir modeling research involves 
proprietary data of the field we had to invest substantial 
efforts initially in educating the application researchers on 
the ability of grid services in supporting the industry 
standard data security through role- and privilege-based 
access using x standard 
with respect to qos application researchers expect 
cluster level qos with grid environments also there is a 
steep learning curve in grid computing compared to the 
conventional cluster computing since grid computing is 
still an emerging technology and it spans over several 
administrative domains grid computing is still premature 
especially in terms of the level of qos although it offers 
better data security standards compared to commodity 
clusters 
it is our observation that training and outreach programs 
that compare and contrast the grid and cluster computing 
environments would be a suitable approach for enhancing 
user participation in grid computing this approach also 
helps users to match their applications and abilities grids 
can offer 
in summary our efforts through tigre in grid-enabling 
the enkf data assimilation methodology showed 
substantial promise in engaging petroleum engineering 
researchers through intercampus collaborations efforts are 
under way to involve more schools in this effort these 
efforts may result in increased collaborative research 
educational opportunities and workforce development 
through graduate faculty research programs across tigre 
institutions
