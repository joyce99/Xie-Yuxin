abstract 
the current boom of the web is associated with the revenues 
originated from on-line advertising while search-based 
advertising is dominant the association of ads with a web 
page during user navigation is becoming increasingly 
important in this work we study the problem of associating 
ads with a web page referred to as content-targeted 
advertising from a computer science perspective we assume that 
we have access to the text of the web page the keywords 
declared by an advertiser and a text associated with the 
advertiser s business using no other information and 
operating in fully automatic fashion we propose ten strategies 
for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness our 
methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into 
account the semantics of the problem referred to as aak 
for ads and keywords can yield gains in average precision 
figures of compared to a trivial vector-based strategy 
further a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy 
which expands the text of the web page to reduce 
vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement can yield 
extra gains in average precision of these are first 
results they suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted 
advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms

 introduction 
the emergence of the internet has opened up new 
marketing opportunities in fact a company has now the possibility 
of showing its advertisements ads to millions of people at a 
low cost during the s many companies invested heavily 
on advertising in the internet with apparently no concerns 
about their investment return this situation radically 
changed in the following decade when the failure of many 
web companies led to a dropping in supply of cheap venture 
capital and a considerable reduction in on-line advertising 
investments 
it was clear then that more effective strategies for on-line 
advertising were required for that it was necessary to take 
into account short-term and long-term interests of the users 
related to their information needs as a consequence 
many companies intensified the adoption of intrusive 
techniques for gathering information of users mostly without 
their consent this raised privacy issues which 
stimulated the research for less invasive measures 
more recently internet information gatekeepers as for 
example search engines recommender systems and 
comparison shopping services have employed what is called paid 
placement strategies in such methods an advertiser 
company is given prominent positioning in advertisement 
lists in return for a placement fee amongst these methods 
the most popular one is a non-intrusive technique called 
keyword targeted marketing in this technique keywords 
extracted from the user s search query are matched against 
keywords associated with ads provided by advertisers a 
ranking of the ads which also takes into consideration the 
amount that each advertiser is willing to pay is computed 
the top ranked ads are displayed in the search result page 
together with the answers for the user query 
the success of keyword targeted marketing has motivated 
information gatekeepers to offer their advertisement services 
in different contexts for example as shown in figure 
relevant ads could be shown to users directly in the pages of 
information portals the motivation is to take advantage of 
 
the users immediate information interests at browsing time 
the problem of matching ads to a web page that is browsed 
which we also refer to as content-targeted advertising 
is different from that of keyword marketing in this case 
instead of dealing with users keywords we have to use the 
contents of a web page to decide which ads to display 
figure example of content-based advertising in 
the page of a newspaper the middle slice of the 
page shows the beginning of an article about the 
launch of a dvd movie at the bottom slice we can 
see advertisements picked for this page by google s 
content-based advertising system adsense 
it is important to notice that paid placement 
advertising strategies imply some risks to information gatekeepers 
for instance there is the possibility of a negative impact 
on their credibility which at long term can demise their 
market share this makes investments in the quality of 
ad recommendation systems even more important to 
minimize the possibility of exhibiting ads unrelated to the user s 
interests by investing in their ad systems information 
gatekeepers are investing in the maintenance of their credibility 
and in the reinforcement of a positive user attitude towards 
the advertisers and their ads further that can 
translate into higher clickthrough rates that lead to an increase in 
revenues for information gatekeepers and advertisers with 
gains to all parts 
in this work we focus on the problem of content-targeted 
advertising we propose new strategies for associating ads 
with a web page five of these strategies are referred to as 
matching strategies they are based on the idea of matching 
the text of the web page directly to the text of the ads and 
its associated keywords five other strategies which we here 
introduce are referred to as impedance coupling strategies 
they are based on the idea of expanding the web page with 
new terms to facilitate the task of matching ads and web 
pages this is motivated by the observation that there is 
frequently a mismatch between the vocabulary of a web page 
and the vocabulary of an advertisement we say that there 
is a vocabulary impedance problem and that our technique 
provides a positive effect of impedance coupling by reducing 
the vocabulary impedance further all our strategies rely 
on information that is already available to information 
gatekeepers that operate keyword targeted advertising systems 
thus no other data from the advertiser is required 
using a sample of a real case database with over 
ads and web pages selected for testing we evaluate our 
ad recommendation strategies first we evaluate the five 
matching strategies they match ads to a web page 
using a standard vector model and provide what we may call 
trivial solutions our results indicate that a strategy that 
matches the ad plus its keywords to a web page requiring 
the keywords to appear in the web page provides 
improvements in average precision figures of roughly relative 
to a strategy that simply matches the ads to the web page 
such strategy which we call aak for ads and keywords 
is then taken as our baseline 
following we evaluate the five impedance coupling 
strategies they are based on the idea of expanding the ad and 
the web page with new terms to reduce the vocabulary 
impedance between their texts our results indicate that it 
is possible to generate extra improvements in average 
precision figures of roughly relative to the aak strategy 
the paper is organized as follows in section we 
introduce five matching strategies to solve content-targeted 
advertising in section we present our impedance 
coupling strategies in section we describe our experimental 
methodology and datasets and discuss our results in 
section we discuss related work in section we present our 
conclusions 
 matching strategies 
keyword advertising relies on matching search queries to 
ads and its associated keywords context-based 
advertising which we address here relies on matching ads and its 
associated keywords to the text of a web page 
given a certain web page p which we call triggering page 
our task is to select advertisements related to the contents 
of p without loss of generality we consider that an 
advertisement ai is composed of a title a textual description 
and a hyperlink to illustrate for the first ad by google 
shown in figure the title is star wars trilogy full 
the description is get this popular dvd free free w free 
shopping sign up now and the hyperlink points to the site 
www freegiftworld com advertisements can be grouped 
by advertisers in groups called campaigns such that a 
campaign can have one or more advertisements 
given our triggering page p and a set a of ads a simple 
way of ranking ai ∈ a with regard to p is by matching the 
contents of p to the contents of ai for this we use the vector 
space model as discussed in the immediately following 
in the vector space model queries and documents are 
represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space let 
wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q 
and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the 
document dj then q w q w q wiq wnq and dj 
 w j w j wij wnj are the weighted vectors used to 
represent the query q and the document dj these weights 
can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes in such schemes 
weights are taken as the product between factors that 
quantify the importance of a term in a document given by the 
term frequency or tf factor and its rarity in the whole 
collection given by the inverse document factor or idf factor 
see for details the ranking of the query q with regard 
to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 
 
formula that is the cosine of the angle between the two 
corresponding vectors 
sim q dj 
q dj 
 q × dj 
 
pn 
i wiq · wij 
qpn 
i w 
iq 
qpn 
i w 
ij 
 
by considering p as the query and ai as the document we 
can rank the ads with regard to the web page p this is our 
first matching strategy it is represented by the function ad 
given by 
ad p ai sim p ai 
where ad stands for direct match of the ad composed by 
title and description and sim p ai is computed according 
to eq 
in our second method we use other source of evidence 
provided by the advertisers the keywords with each 
advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki which 
may be composed of one or more terms we denote the 
association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki 
as the pair ai ki ∈ k where k is the set of associations 
made by the advertisers in the case of keyword targeted 
advertising such keywords are used to match the ads to the 
user queries in here we use them to match ads to the web 
page p this provides our second method for ad matching 
given by 
kw p ai sim p ki 
where ai ki ∈ k and kw stands for match the ad 
keywords 
we notice that most of the keywords selected by 
advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those 
keywords for instance in our advertisement test collection 
this is true for of the ads thus instead of using the 
keywords as matching devices we can use them to emphasize 
the main concepts in an ad in an attempt to improve our 
ad strategy this leads to our third method of ad matching 
given by 
ad kw p ai sim p ai ∪ ki 
where ai ki ∈ k and ad kw stands for match the ad and 
its keywords 
finally it is important to notice that the keyword ki 
associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page 
p even when ai is highly ranked however if we assume that 
ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an 
advertiser viewpoint it can be interesting to assure its presence 
in p this reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence 
of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition 
to associate ai with p might lead to improved results this 
leads to two extra matching strategies as follows 
andkw p ai 
 
sim p ai if ki p 
 if otherwise 
ad andkw p ai aak p ai 
 
sim p ai ∪ ki if ki p 
 if otherwise 
where ai ki ∈ k andkw stands for match the ad keywords 
and force their appearance and ad andkw or aak for ads 
and keywords stands for match the ad its keywords and 
force their appearance 
as we will see in our results the best among these simple 
methods is aak thus it will be used as baseline for our 
impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss 
 impedance coupling strategies 
two key issues become clear as one plays with the 
contenttargeted advertising problem first the triggering page 
normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the 
advertisements second the association between a good 
advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic 
that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page 
the first issue is due to the fact that web pages can be 
about any subject and that advertisements are concise in 
nature that is ads tend to be more topic restricted than 
web pages the second issue is related to the fact that as 
we later discuss most advertisers place a small number of 
advertisements as a result we have few terms describing 
their interest areas consequently these terms tend to be 
of a more general nature for instance a car shop probably 
would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe 
its core business topic as a consequence many specific 
terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in 
the advertisements to make matters worst a page might 
refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label 
that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to 
refer to the same entity 
a consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of 
pages and ads have low intersection even when an ad is 
related to a page we cite this problem from now on as 
the vocabulary impedance problem in our experiments we 
realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct 
matching strategies therefore we studied alternatives to 
reduce the referred vocabulary impedance 
for this we propose to expand the triggering pages with 
new terms figure illustrates our intuition we already 
know that the addition of keywords selected by the 
advertiser to the ads leads to improved results we say that a 
keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an 
alternative matching path our idea is to add new terms 
 words to the web page p to also reduce the vocabulary 
impedance by providing a second alternative matching path 
we refer to our expansion technique as impedance coupling 
for this we proceed as follows 
expansion 
terms keyword 
vocabulary impedance 
triggering 
page p ad 
figure addition of new terms to a web page to 
reduce the vocabulary impedance 
an advertiser trying to describe a certain topic in a concise 
way probably will choose general terms to characterize that 
topic to facilitate the matching between this ad and our 
triggering page p we need to associate new general terms 
with p for this we assume that web documents similar 
to the triggering page p share common topics therefore 
 
by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we 
might find good terms for better characterizing the main 
topics in the page p we now describe this idea using a 
bayesian network model depicted in figure 
r 
d d dj dk 
t t t ti tm 
 
 
figure bayesian network model for our 
impedance coupling technique 
in our model which is based on the belief network in 
the nodes represent pieces of information in the domain 
with each node is associated a binary random variable 
which takes the value to mean that the corresponding 
entity a page or terms is observed and thus relevant in our 
computations in this case we say that the information was 
observed node r represents the page r a new 
representation for the triggering page p let n be the set of the k 
most similar documents to the triggering page including the 
triggering page p itself in a large enough web collection c 
root nodes d through dk represent the documents in n 
that is the triggering page d and its k nearest neighbors 
d through dk among all pages in c there is an edge 
from node dj to node r if document dj is in n nodes 
t through tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of c 
there is an edge from node dj to a node ti if term ti occurs 
in document dj in our model the observation of the pages 
in n leads to the observation of a new representation of the 
triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main 
topics associated with p and its neighbors 
given these definitions we can now use the network to 
determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for 
representing a topic of the triggering page p in other words 
we are interested in the probability of observing the final 
evidence regarding a term ti given that the new 
representation of the page p has been observed p ti r 
this translates into the following equation 
 
p ti r 
 
p r 
x 
d 
p ti d p r d p d 
where d represents the set of states of the document nodes 
since we are interested just in the states in which only a 
single document dj is observed and p d can be regarded as 
a constant we can rewrite eq as 
p ti r 
ν 
p r 
kx 
j 
p ti dj p r dj 
where dj represents the state of the document nodes in 
which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 
 
to simplify our notation we represent the probabilities 
p x as p x and p x as p x 
associated with p dj eq is the general equation to 
compute the probability that a term ti is related to the 
triggering page we now define the probabilities p ti dj and 
p r dj as follows 
p ti dj η wij 
p r dj 
 
 − α j 
α sim r dj ≤ j ≤ k 
 
where η is a normalizing constant wij is the weight 
associated with term ti in the document dj and sim p dj is 
given by eq i e is the cosine similarity between p and 
dj the weight wij is computed using a classic tf-idf scheme 
and is zero if term ti does not occur in document dj notice 
that p ti dj − p ti dj and p r dj − p r dj 
by defining the constant α it is possible to determine how 
important should be the influence of the triggering page p 
to its new representation r by substituting eq and 
eq into eq we obtain 
p ti r ρ − α wi α 
kx 
j 
wij sim r dj 
where ρ η ν is a normalizing constant 
we use eq to determine the set of terms that will 
compose r as illustrated in figure let ttop be the top 
ranked term according to eq the set r is composed 
of the terms ti such that p ti r 
p ttop r 
≥ β where β is a given 
threshold in our experiments we have used β 
notice that the set r might contain terms that already occur 
in p that is while we will refer to the set r as expansion 
terms it should be clear that p ∩ r ∅ 
by using α we simply consider the terms originally 
in page p by increasing α we relax the context of the page 
p adding terms from neighbor pages turning page p into its 
new representation r this is important because sometimes 
a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers 
a good opportunity for advertising for example consider 
a triggering page that describes a congress in london about 
digital photography although london is probably not an 
important topic in this page advertisements about hotels 
in london would be appropriate thus adding hotels to 
page p is important this suggests using α that is 
preserving the contents of p and using the terms in r to 
expand p 
in this paper we examine both approaches thus in our 
sixth method we match r the set of new expansion terms 
directly to the ads as follows 
aak t p ai aak r ai 
where aak t stands for match the ad and keywords to the 
set r of expansion terms 
in our seventh method we match an expanded page p to 
the ads as follows 
aak exp p ai aak p ∪ r ai 
where aak exp stands for match the ad and keywords to 
the expanded triggering page 
 
to improve our ad placement methods other external 
source that we can use is the content of the page h pointed to 
by the advertisement s hyperlink that is its landing page 
after all this page comprises the real target of the ad and 
perhaps could present a more detailed description of the 
product or service being advertised given that the 
advertisement ai points to the landing page hi we denote this 
association as the pair ai hi ∈ h where h is the set of 
associations between the ads and the pages they point to 
our eighth method consists of matching the triggering page 
p to the landing pages pointed to by the advertisements as 
follows 
h p ai sim p hi 
where ai hi ∈ h and h stands for match the hyperlink 
pointed to by the ad 
we can also combine this information with the more 
promising methods previously described aak and aak exp as 
follows given that ai hi ∈ h and ai ki ∈ k we have our 
last two methods 
aak h p ai 
 
sim p ai ∪ hi ∪ ki if ki p 
 if otherwise 
aak exp h p ai 
 
sim p ∪ r ai ∪ hi ∪ ki if ki p ∪ r 
 if otherwise 
where aak h stands for match ads and keywords also 
considering the page pointed by the ad and aah exp h stands 
for match ads and keywords with expanded triggering page 
also considering the page pointed by the ad 
notice that other combinations were not considered in this 
study due to space restrictions these other combinations 
led to poor results in our experimentation and for this reason 
were discarded 
 experiments 
 methodology 
to evaluate our ad placement strategies we performed 
a series of experiments using a sample of a real case ad 
collection with advertisements advertisers and 
 keywords 
 the advertisements are grouped in 
campaigns with an average of campaigns per advertiser 
for the strategies aak t and aak exp we had to 
generate a set of expansion terms for that we used a database 
of web pages crawled by the todobr search engine 
 http www todobr com br this database is composed 
of pages of the brazilian web under the domain 
 br for the strategies h aak h and aak exp h we also 
crawled the pages pointed to by the advertisers no other 
filtering method was applied to these pages besides the 
removal of html tags 
since we are initially interested in the placement of 
advertisements in the pages of information portals our test 
collection was composed of pages extracted from a 
brazilian newspaper these are our triggering pages they were 
crawled in such a way that only the contents of their 
articles was preserved as we have no preferences for particular 
 
data in portuguese provided by an on-line advertisement 
company that operates in brazil 
topics the crawled pages cover topics as diverse as politics 
economy sports and culture 
for each of our triggering pages we selected the top 
three ranked ads provided by each of our ad placement 
strategies thus for each triggering page we select no more 
than ads these top ads were then inserted in a pool 
for that triggering page each pool contained an average of 
 advertisements all advertisements in each pool were 
submitted to a manual evaluation by a group of users 
the average number of relevant advertisements per page 
pool was notice that we adopted the same pooling 
method used to evaluate the trec web-based collection 
to quantify the precision of our results we used -point 
average figures since we are not able to evaluate the 
entire ad collection recall values are relative to the set of 
evaluated advertisements 
 tuning idf factors 
we start by analyzing the impact of different idf factors 
in our advertisement collection idf factors are important 
because they quantify how discriminative is a term in the 
collection in our ad collection idf factors can be computed 
by taking ads advertisers or campaigns as documents to 
exemplify consider the computation of ad idf for a term 
ti that occurs times in a collection of ads then the 
inverse document frequency of ti is given by 
idfi log 
 
 
hence we can compute ad advertiser or campaign idf 
factors as we observe in figure for the ad strategy the best 
ranking is obtained by the use of campaign idf that is by 
calculating our idf factor so that it discriminates campaigns 
similar results were obtained for all the other methods

figure precision-recall curves obtained for the

this reflects the fact that terms might be better 
discriminators for a business topic than for an specific ad this 
effect can be accomplished by calculating the factor relative 
to idf advertisers or campaigns instead of ads in fact 
campaign idf factors yielded the best results thus they will be 
used in all the experiments reported from now on 
 
 results 
matching strategies 
figure displays the results for the matching strategies 
presented in section as shown directly matching the 
contents of the ad to the triggering page ad strategy is not so 
effective the reason is that the ad contents are very noisy 
it may contain messages that do not properly describe the 
ad topics such as requisitions for user actions e g visit our 
site and general sentences that could be applied to any 
product or service e g we delivery for the whole 
country on the other hand an advertiser provided keyword 
summarizes well the topic of the ad as a consequence the 
kw strategy is superior to the ad and ad kw strategies this 
situation changes when we require the keywords to appear 
in the target web page by filtering out ads whose keywords 
do not occur in the triggering page much noise is discarded 
this makes andkw a better alternative than kw further in 
this new situation the contents of the ad becomes useful 
to rank the most relevant ads making ad andkw or aak for 
ads and keywords the best among all described methods 
for this reason we adopt aak as our baseline in the next set 
of experiments

figure illustrates our results when the set r of 
expansion terms is used they show that matching the ads to 
the terms in the set r instead of to the triggering page p 
 aak t strategy leads to a considerable improvement over 
our baseline aak the gain is even larger when we use the 
terms in r to expand the triggering page aak exp method 
this confirms our hypothesis that the triggering page could 
have some interesting terms that should not be completely 
discarded 
finally we analyze the impact on the ranking of using the 
contents of pages pointed by the ads figure displays our 
results it is clear that using only the contents of the pages 
pointed by the ads h strategy yields very poor results 
however combining evidence from the pages pointed by the 
ads with our baseline yields improved results most 
important combining our best strategy so far aak exp with 
pages pointed by ads aak exp h strategy leads to superior 
results this happens because the two additional sources 
of evidence expansion terms and pages pointed by the ads 
are distinct and complementary providing extra and 
valuable information for matching ads to a web page

 performance issues 
in a keyword targeted advertising system ads are assigned 
at query time thus the performance of the system is a very 
important issue in content-targeted advertising systems 
we can associate ads with a page at publishing or 
updating time also if a new ad comes in we might consider 
assigning this ad to already published pages in oﬄine mode 
that is we might design the system such that its 
performance depends fundamentally on the rate that new pages

page expansion and ad link crawling can be gathered and 
processed oﬄine not affecting the user experience thus 
from this point of view the performance is not critical and 
will not be addressed in this work 
 related work 
several works have stressed the importance of relevance 
in advertising for example in it was shown that 
advertisements that are presented to users when they are not 
interested on them are viewed just as annoyance thus 
in order to be effective the authors conclude that 
advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the 
time of exposure the results in enforce this conclusion 
by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising the 
more effective it is 
therefore it is not surprising that other works have 
addressed the relevance issue for instance in it is proposed 
a system called adwiz that is able to adapt online 
advertisement to a user s short-term interests in a non-intrusive 
way contrary to our work adwiz does not directly use 
the content of the page viewed by the user it relies on search 
keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the 
url of the page requested by the user on the other hand 
in the authors presented an intrusive approach in which 
an agent sits between advertisers and the user s browser 
allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page 
in spite of having the opportunity to use the page s content 
 
the agent infers relevance based on category information and 
user s private information collected along the time 
in the authors provide a comparison between the 
ranking strategies used by google and overture for their keyword 
advertising systems both systems select advertisements by 
matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a 
search query and rank the resulting advertisement list 
according to the advertisers willingness to pay in 
particular google approach also considers the clickthrough rate 
of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its 
relevance the authors conclude that google s strategy is better 
than that used by overture as mentioned before the 
ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of 
content-targeted advertising instead of dealing with 
keywords provided by users in search queries we have to deal 
with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse 
finally the work in focuses on improving search 
engine results in a trec collection by means of an automatic 
query expansion method based on knn such method 
resembles our expansion approach presented in section 
our method is different from that presented by they 
expand user queries applied to a document collection with 
terms extracted from the top k documents returned as 
answer to the query in the same collection in our case we 
use two collections an advertisement and a web collection 
we expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the 
web collection and then we match these expanded pages to 
the ads from the advertisement collection by doing this we 
emphasize the main topics of the triggering pages increasing 
the possibility of associating relevant ads with them 
 conclusions 
in this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for 
associating ads with a web page that is browsed 
 contenttargeted advertising five of our strategies attempt to 
match the ads directly to the web page because of that 
they are called matching strategies the other five 
strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem 
among ads and web pages and attempt to solve the problem 
by expanding the web pages and the ads with new terms 
because of that they are called impedance coupling 
strategies 
using a sample of a real case database with over 
thousand ads we evaluated our strategies for the five matching 
strategies our results indicated that planned consideration 
of additional evidence such as the keywords provided by the 
advertisers yielded gains in average precision figures for 
our test collection of this was obtained by a 
strategy called aak for ads and keywords which is taken as 
the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance 
coupling strategies 
for our five impedance coupling strategies the results 
indicate that additional gains in average precision of now 
relative to the aak strategy are possible these were 
generated by expanding the web page with new terms obtained 
using a sample web collection containing over five million 
pages and the ads with the contents of the page they point 
to a hyperlink provided by the advertisers 
these are first time results that indicate that high quality 
content-targeted advertising is feasible and practical
