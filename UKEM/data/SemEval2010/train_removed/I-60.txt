abstract 
as more and more cars are equipped with gps and wi-fi 
transmitters it becomes easier to design systems that will 
allow cars to interact autonomously with each other e g 
regarding traffic on the roads indeed car manufacturers 
are already equipping their cars with such devices though 
currently these systems are a proprietary we envision a 
natural evolution where agent applications will be developed 
for vehicular systems e g to improve car routing in dense 
urban areas nonetheless this new technology and agent 
applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car 
owners who will care more about their own welfare than the 
social welfare of their peers these car owners will try to 
manipulate their agents such that they transmit false data 
to their peers using a simulation environment which 
models a real transportation network in a large city we 
demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no 
counter-measures are implemented

 introduction 
as technology advances more and more cars are being 
equipped with devices which enable them to act as 
autonomous agents an important advancement in this 
respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks 
 such as wi-fi which enable the exchange of information 
between cars e g for locating road congestions and 
optimal routes or improving traffic safety 
vehicle-to-vehicle v v communication is already 
onboard by some car manufactures enabling the 
collaboration between different cars on the road for example gm s 
proprietary algorithm called the threat assessment 
algorithm constantly calculates in real time other vehicles 
positions and speeds and enables messaging other cars when 
a collision is imminent also honda has began testing its 
system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the 
highway system itself 
in this paper we investigate the attraction of being a 
selfish agent in vehicular networks that is we investigate the 
benefits achieved by car owners who tamper with on-board 
devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in 
them which act for their benefit we build on the notion 
of gossip networks introduced by shavitt and shay in 
which the agents can obtain road congestion information by 
gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication 
we recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested 
agents could embark upon in the context of vehicular 
networks in the first behavior described in section the 
objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their 
own utility expressed by their average journey duration on 
the road this situation can be modeled in real life by car 
owners whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as 
possible and would like to have their way free of other cars to 
this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents by 
injecting false information into the network this is achieved 
by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route 
to other agents in the network in the hope of making the 
other agents believe that the route is jammed and causing 
them to choose a different route 
the second type of behavior described in section is 
modeled by the self-interested agents objective to cause 
disorder in the network more than they are interested in 
maximizing their own utility this kind of behavior could 
be generated for example by vandalism or terrorists who 
aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible 
we note that the introduction of self-interested agents to 
the network would most probably motivate other agents to 
try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect 
this is similar though in a different context to the problem 
introduced by lamport et al as the byzantine generals 
problem however the introduction of mechanisms to deal 
with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming in 
this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish 
behavior by these agents while we also provide some insights 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and 
minimizing their effect 
to demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested 
agents we have used a simulation environment which 
models the transportation network in a central part of a large 
real city the simulation environment is further described in 
section our simulations provide insights to the benefits 
of self-interested agents cheating our findings can motivate 
future research in this field in order to minimize the effect 
of selfish-agents 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 
we review related work in the field of self-interested agents 
and v v communications we continue and formally 
describe our environment and simulation settings in section 
sections and describe the different behaviors of the 
selfinterested agents and our findings finally we conclude the 
paper with open questions and future research directions 
 related work 
in their seminal paper lamport et al describe the 
byzantine generals problem in which processors need to 
handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting 
information to different parts of the system they also present 
a model in which not all agents are connected and thus an 
agent cannot send a message to all the other agents dolev et 
al has built on this problem and has analyzed the number 
of faulty agents that can be tolerated in order to eventually 
reach the right conclusion about true data similar work 
is presented by minsky et al who discuss techniques 
for constructing gossip protocols that are resilient to up to 
t malicious host failures as opposed to the above works 
our work focuses on vehicular networks in which the agents 
are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data 
also the domain of transportation networks introduces 
dynamic data as the load of the roads is subject to change in 
addition the system in transportation networks has a 
feedback mechanism since the load in the roads depends on the 
reports and the movement of the agents themselves 
malkhi et al present a gossip algorithm for 
propagating information in a network of processors in the presence 
of malicious parties their algorithm prevents the spreading 
of spurious gossip and diffuses genuine data this is done 
in time which is logarithmic in the number of processes 
and linear in the number of corrupt parties nevertheless 
their work assumes that the network is static and also that 
the agents are static they discuss a network of processors 
this is not true for transportation networks for example 
in our model agents might gossip about heavy traffic load 
of a specific road which is currently jammed yet this 
information might be false several minutes later leaving the 
agents to speculate whether the spreading agents are indeed 
malicious or not in addition as the agents are constantly 
moving each agent cannot choose with whom he interacts 
and exchanges data 
in the context of analyzing the data and deciding whether 
the data is true or not researchers have focused on 
distributed reputation systems or decision mechanisms to decide 
whether or not to share data 
yu and singh build a social network of agents 
reputations every agent keeps a list of its neighbors which can 
be changed over time and computes the trustworthiness of 
other agents by updating the current values of testimonies 
obtained from reliable referral chains after a bad 
experience with another agent every agent decreases the rating of 
the bad agent and propagates this bad experience 
throughout the network so that other agents can update their 
ratings accordingly this approach might be implemented in 
our domain to allow gossip agents to identify self-interested 
agents and thus minimize their effect however the 
implementation of such a mechanism is an expensive addition 
to the infrastructure of autonomous agents in 
transportation networks this is mainly due to the dynamic nature of 
the list of neighbors in transportation networks thus not 
only does it require maintaining the neighbors list since the 
neighbors change frequently but it is also harder to build a 
good reputation system 
leckie et al focus on the issue of when to share 
information between the agents in the network their domain 
involves monitoring distributed sensors each agent 
monitors a subset of the sensors and evaluates a hypothesis based 
on the local measurements of its sensors if the agent 
believes that a hypothesis is sufficient likely he exchanges this 
information with the other agents in their domain the 
goal of all the agents is to reach a global consensus about 
the likelihood of the hypothesis in our domain however as 
the agents constantly move they have many samples which 
they exchange with each other also the data might also 
vary e g a road might be reported as jammed but a few 
minutes later it could be free thus making it harder to 
decide whether to trust the agent who sent the data 
moreover the agent might lie only about a subset of its samples 
thus making it even harder to detect his cheating 
some work has been done in the context of gossip networks 
or transportation networks regarding the spreading of data 
and its dissemination 
datta et al focus on information dissemination in 
mobile ad-hoc networks manet they propose an 
autonomous gossiping algorithm for an infrastructure-less 
mobile ad-hoc networking environment their autonomous 
gossiping algorithm uses a greedy mechanism to spread data 
items in the network the data items are spread to 
immediate neighbors that are interested in the information and 
avoid ones that are not interested the decision which node 
is interested in the information is made by the data item 
itself using heuristics however their work concentrates on 
the movement of the data itself and not on the agents who 
propagate the data this is different from our scenario in 
which each agent maintains the data it has gathered while 
the agent itself roams the road and is responsible and has 
the capabilities for spreading the data to other agents in 
the network 
das et al propose a cooperative strategy for content 
delivery in vehicular networks in their domain peers 
download a file from a mesh and exchange pieces of the file among 
themselves we on the other hand are interested in 
vehicular networks in which there is no rule forcing the agents to 
cooperate among themselves 
shibata et al propose a method for cars to 
cooperatively and autonomously collect traffic jam statistics to 
estimate arrival time to destinations for each car the 
communication is based on ieee without using a fixed 
infrastructure on the ground while we use the same 
domain we focus on a different problem shibata et al 
mainly focus on efficiently broadcasting the data between 
agents e g avoid duplicates and communication overhead 
as we focus on the case where agents are not cooperative in 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
nature and on how selfish agents affect other agents and the 
network load 
wang et al also assert in the context of wireless 
networks that individual agents are likely to do what is most 
beneficial for their owners and will act selfishly they design 
a protocol for communication in networks in which all agents 
are selfish their protocol motivates every agent to 
maximize its profit only when it behaves truthfully a mechanism 
of incentive compatibility however the domain of wireless 
networks is quite different from the domain of 
transportation networks in the wireless network the wireless terminal 
is required to contribute its local resources to transmit data 
thus wang et al use a payment mechanism which 
attaches costs to terminals when transmitting data and thus 
enables them to maximize their utility when transmitting 
data instead of acting selfishly unlike this in the context 
of transportation networks constructing such a mechanism 
is not quite a straightforward task as self-interested agents 
and regular gossip agents might incur the same cost when 
transmitting data the difference between the two types of 
agents only exists regarding the credibility of the data they 
exchange 
in the next section we will describe our transportation 
network model and gossiping between the agents we will 
also describe the different agents in our system 
 model and simulations 
we first describe the formal transportation network model 
and then we describe the simulations designs 
 formal model 
following shavitt and shay and parshani the 
transportation network is represented by a directed graph 
g v e where v is the set of vertices representing 
junctions and e is the set of edges representing roads an edge 
e ∈ e is associated with a weight w which specifies 
the time it takes to traverse the road associated with that 
edge the roads weights vary in time according to the 
network traffic load each car which is associated with an 
autonomous agent is given a pair of origin and destination 
points vertices a journey is defined as the not 
necessarily simple path taken by an agent between the origin vertex 
and the destination vertex we assume that there is always 
a path between a source and a destination a journey length 
is defined as the sum of all weights of the edges constituting 
this path every agent has to travel between its origin and 
destination points and aims to minimize its journey length 
initially agents are ignorant about the state of the roads 
regular agents are only capable of gathering information 
about the roads as they traverse them however we assume 
that some agents have means of inter-vehicle 
communication e g ieee with a given communication range 
which enables them to communicate with other agents with 
the same device those agents are referred to as gossip 
agents since the communication range is limited the 
exchange of information using gossiping is done in one of two 
ways a between gossip agents passing one another or b 
between gossip agents located at the same junction we 
assume that each agent stores the most recent information it 
has received or gathered around the edges in the network 
a subset of the gossip agents are those agents who are 
selfinterested and manipulate the devices for their own benefit 
we will refer to these agents as self-interested agents a 
detailed description of their behavior is given in sections 
and 
 simulation design 
building on the network in our simulations replicates 
a central part of a large city and consists of junctions 
and roads which are approximately the number of main 
streets in the city each simulation consists of iterations 
the basic time unit of the iteration is a step which 
equivalents to about seconds each iteration simulates six hours 
of movements the average number of cars passing through 
the network during the iteration is about and the 
average number of cars in the network at a specific time unit 
is about cars in each iteration the same agents are 
used with the same origin and destination points whereas 
the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the 
future iterations referred to as the history of the agent 
this allows us to simulate somewhat a daily routine in the 
transportation network e g a working week 
each of the experiments that we describe below is run 
with different traffic scenarios each such traffic scenario 
differs from one another by the initial load of the roads and 
the designated routes of the agents cars in the network 
for each such scenario simulations are run creating a total 
of simulations for each experiment 
it has been shown by parshani et al that the 
information propagation in the network is very efficient when 
the percentage of gossiping agents is or more yet due 
to congestion caused by too many cars rushing to what is 
reported as the less congested part of the network - 
of gossiping agents leads to the most efficient routing results 
in their experiments thus in our simulation we focus only 
on simulations in which the percentage of gossip agents is 
 
the simulations were done with different percentages of 
self-interested agents to gain statistical significance we ran 
each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents 
and the set of the self-interested agents 
in order to gain a similar ordinal scale the results were 
normalized the normalized values were calculated by 
comparing each agent s result to his results when the same 
scenario was run with no self-interested agents this was done 
for all of the iterations using the normalized values enabled 
us to see how worse or better each agent would perform 
compared to the basic setting for example if an average 
journey length of a certain agent in iteration with no 
selfinterested agent was and the length was in the same 
scenario and iteration in which self-interested agents were 
involved then the normalized value for that agent would be 
 
more details regarding the simulations are described in 
sections and 
 spreading lies maximizing 
utility 
in the first set of experiments we investigated the benefits 
achieved by the self-interested agents whose aim was to 
minimize their own journey length the self-interested agents 
adopted a cheating approach in which they sent false data 
to their peers 
in this section we first describe the simulations with the 
self-interested agents then we model the scenario as a 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
game with two types of agents and prove that the 
equilibrium result can only be achieved when there is no efficient 
exchange of gossiping information in the network 
 modeling the self-interested agents 
behavior 
while the gossip agents gather data and send it to other 
agents the self-interested agents behavior is modeled as 
follows 
 calculate the shortest path from origin to destination 
 communicate the following data to other agents 
 a if the road is not in the agent s route - send the 
true data about it e g data about roads it has 
received from other agents 
 b for all roads in the agent s route which the agent 
has not yet traversed send a random high weight 
basically the self-interested agent acts the same as the 
gossip agent it collects data regarding the weight of the roads 
 either by traversing the road or by getting the data from 
other agents and sends the data it has collected to other 
agents however the self-interested agent acts differently 
when the road is in its route since the agent s goal is to 
reach its destination as fast as possible the agent will falsely 
report that all the roads in its route are heavily congested 
this is in order to free the path for itself by making other 
agents recalculate their paths this time without including 
roads on the self-interested agent s route to this end for 
all the roads in its route which the agent has not yet passed 
the agent generates a random weight which is above the 
average weight of the roads in the network it then associates 
these new weights with the roads in its route and sends them 
to the other agents 
while an agent can also divert cars from its route by 
falsely reporting congested roads in parallel to its route as 
free this behavior is not very likely since other agents 
attempting to use the roads will find the mistake within a 
short time and spread the true congestion on the road on 
the other hand if an agent manages to persuade other agents 
not to use a road it will be harder for them to detect that 
the said roads are not congested 
in addition to avoid being influenced by its own lies and 
other lies spreading in the network all self-interested agents 
will ignore data received about roads with heavy traffic note 
that data about roads that are not heavily traffic will not 
be ignored 
 
in the next subsection we describe the simulation results 
involving the self-interested agents 
 simulation results 
to test the benefits of cheating by the self-interested agents 
we ran several experiments in the first set of experiments 
we created a scenario in which a small group of self-interested 
agents spread lies on the same route and tested its 
effect on the journey length of all the agents in the network 
 
in other simulations we have run in which there had been 
several real congestions in the network we indeed saw that 
even when the roads are jammed the self-interested agents 
were less affected if they ignored all reported heavy traffic 
since by such they also discarded all lies roaming the network 
table normalized journey length values 
selfinterested agents with the same route 
iteration self-interested gossip - gossip - regular 
number agents sr others agents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thus several cars which had the same origin and 
destination points were designated as self-interested agents in this 
simulation we selected only agents to be part of the group 
of the self-interested agents as we wanted to investigate the 
effect achieved by only a small number of agents 
in each simulation in this experiment different agents 
were randomly chosen to be part of the group of self-interested 
agents as described above in addition one road on the 
route of these agents was randomly selected to be partially 
blocked letting only one car go through that road at each 
time step about agents were randomly selected as 
regular gossip agents and the other agents were 
designated as regular agents 
we analyzed the average journey length of the self-interested 
agents as opposed to the average journey length of other 
regular gossip agents traveling along the same route table 
 summarizes the normalized results for the self-interested 
agents the gossip agents those having the same origin and 
destination points as the self-interested agents denoted 
gossip - sr and all other gossip agents denoted gossip - 
others and the regular agents as a function of the iteration 
number 
we can see from the results that the first time the 
selfinterested agents traveled the route while spreading the false 
data about the roads did not help them using the paired 
t-test we show that those agents had significantly lower 
journey lengths in the scenario in which they did not spread any 
lies with p this is mainly due to the fact that 
the lies do not bypass the self-interested agent and reach 
other cars that are ahead of the self-interested car on the 
same route thus spreading the lies in the first iteration 
does not help the self-interested agent to free the route he 
is about to travel in the first iteration 
only when the self-interested agents had repeated their 
journey in the next iteration iteration did it help them 
significantly p the reason for this is that other 
gossip agents received this data and used it to recalculate their 
shortest path thus avoiding entrance to the roads for which 
the self-interested agents had spread false information about 
congestion it is also interesting to note the large value 
attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration 
this is mainly due to several self-interested agents who 
entered the jammed road this situation occurred since the 
self-interested agents ignored all heavy traffic data and thus 
ignored the fact that the road was jammed as they started 
spreading lies about this road more cars shifted from this 
route thus making the road free for the future iterations 
however we also recall that the self-interested agents 
ignore all information about the heavy traffic roads thus 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
table normalized journey length values 
spreading lies for a beneficiary agent 
iteration beneficiary gossip - gossip - regular 
number agent sr others agents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when the network becomes congested more self-interested 
cars are affected since they might enter jammed roads 
which they would otherwise not have entered this can be 
seen for example in iterations - in which the normalized 
value of the self-interested agents increased above 
using the paired t-test to compare these values with the values 
achieved by these agents when no lies are used we see that 
there is no significant difference between the two scenarios 
as opposed to the gossip agents we can see how little 
effect the self-interested agents have on the regular agents 
as compared to the gossip agents on the same route that 
have traveled as much as more when self-interested 
agents are introduced the average journey length for the 
regular agents has only increased by about this result 
is even lower than the effect on other gossip agents in the 
entire network 
since we noticed that cheating by the self-interested agents 
does not benefit them in the first iteration we devised 
another set of experiments in the second set of experiments 
the self-interested agents have the objective to help another 
agent who is supposed to enter the network some time 
after the self-interested agent entered we refer to the latter 
agent as the beneficiary agent just like a self-interested 
agent the beneficiary agent also ignores all data regarding 
heavy traffic in real-life this can be modeled for 
example by a husband who would like to help his wife find a 
faster route to her destination table summarizes the 
normalized values for the different agents as in the first set 
of experiments simulations were run for each scenario 
with a total of simulations in each of these simulation 
one agent was randomly selected as a self-interested agent 
and then another agent with the same origin as the 
selfinterested agent was randomly selected as the beneficiary 
agent the other and agents were designated 
as regular gossip agents and regular agents respectively 
we can see that as the number of iterations advances the 
lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent in this 
scenario just like the previous one in the first iterations 
not only does the beneficiary agent not avoid the jammed 
roads since he ignores all heavy traffic he also does not 
benefit from the lies spread by the self-interested agent this 
is due to the fact that the lies are not yet incorporated by 
other gossip agents thus if we compare the average journey 
length in the first iteration when lies are spread and when 
there are no lies the average is significantly lower when there 
are no lies p on the other hand if we compare 
the average journey length in all of the iterations there is 
no significant difference between the two settings still in 
most of the iterations the average journey length of the 
beneficiary agent is longer than in the case when no lies are 
spread 
we can also see the impact on the other agents in the 
system while the gossip agents which are not on the 
route of the beneficiary agent virtually are not affected by 
the self-interested agent those on the route and the 
regular agents are affected and have higher normalized values 
that is even with just one self-interested car we can see 
that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as 
the lies spread by the self-interested agents and other 
regular agents increase their journey length by more than 
in our third set of experiments we examined a setting in 
which there was an increasing number of agents and the 
agents did not necessarily have the same origin and 
destination points to model this we randomly selected 
selfinterested agents whose objective was to minimize their 
average journey length assuming the cars were repeating 
their journeys that is more than one iteration was made 
as opposed to the first set of experiments in this set the 
self-interested agents were selected randomly and we did 
not enforce the constraint that they will all have the same 
origin and destination points 
as in the previous sets of experiments we ran 
different simulations per scenario in each simulation runs 
were made each run with different numbers of self-interested 
agents no self-interested agents and each 
agent adopted the behavior modeled in section figure 
 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested 
agents as a function of their number the figure shows these 
values for iterations - the first iteration is not shown 
intentionally as we assume repeated journeys also we have 
seen in the previous set of experiments and we have 
provided explanations as to why the self-interested agents do 
not gain much from their behavior in the first iteration

figure self-interested agents normalized values as 
a function of the number of self-interested agents 
using these simulations we examined what the threshold 
could be for the number of randomly selected self-interested 
agents in order to allow themselves to benefit from their 
selfish behavior we can see that up to self-interested 
agents the average normalized value is below that is 
they benefit from their malicious behavior in the case of 
one self-interested agent there is a significant difference 
between the average journey length of when the agent spread 
lies and when no lies are spread p while when 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
there are and self-interested agents there is no 
significance difference yet as the number of self-interested 
agents increases the normalized value also increases in 
such cases the normalized value is larger than and the 
self-interested agents journey length becomes significantly 
higher than their journey length in cases where there are 
no self-interested agents in the system 
in the next subsection we analyze the scenario as a game 
and show that when in equilibrium the exchange of gossiping 
between the agents becomes inefficient 
 when gossiping is inefficient 
we continued and modeled our scenario as a game in 
order to find the equilibrium there are two possible types for 
the agents a regular gossip agents and b self-interested 
agents each of these agents is a representative of its group 
and thus all agents in the same group have similar behavior 
we note that the advantage of using gossiping in 
transportation networks is to allow the agents to detect anomalies 
in the network e g traffic jams and to quickly adapt to 
them by recalculating their routes we also assume that 
the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their 
own journey length thus they spread lies on their routes as 
described in section we also assume that sophisticated 
methods for identifying the self-interested agents or 
managing reputation are not used this is mainly due to the 
complexity of incorporating and maintaining such mechanisms 
as well as due to the dynamics of the network in which 
interactions between different agents are frequent agents may 
leave the network and data about the road might change as 
time progresses e g a road might be reported by a regular 
gossip agent as free at a given time yet it may currently be 
jammed due to heavy traffic on the road 
let tavg be the average time it takes to traverse an edge 
in the transportation network that is the average load of 
an edge let tmax be the maximum time it takes to 
traverse an edge we will investigate the game in which the 
self-interested and the regular gossip agents can choose the 
following actions the self-interested agents can choose how 
much to lie that is they can choose to spread how long not 
necessarily the true duration it takes to traverse certain 
roads since the objective of the self-interested agents is to 
spread messages as though some roads are jammed the 
traversal time they report is obviously larger than the average 
time we denote the time the self-interested agents spread 
as ts such that tavg ≤ ts ≤ tmax motivated by the 
results of the simulations we have described above we saw that 
the agents are less affected if they discard the heavy traffic 
values thus the regular gossip cars attempting to 
mitigate the effect of the liars can choose a strategy to ignore 
abnormal congestion values above a certain threshold tg 
obviously tavg ≤ tg ≤ tmax in order to prevent the 
gossip agents from detecting the lies and just discarding those 
values the self-interested agents send lies in a given range 
 ts tmax with an inverse geometric distribution that is 
the higher the t value the higher its frequency 
now we construct the utility functions for each type of 
agents which is defined by the values of ts and tg if the 
self-interested agents spread traversal times higher than or 
equal to the regular gossip cars threshold they will not 
benefit from those lies thus the utility value of the 
selfinterested agents in this case is on the other hand if the 
self-interested agents spread traversal time which is lower 
than the threshold they will gain a positive utility value 
from the regular gossip agents point-of-view if they accept 
messages from the self-interested agents then they 
incorporate the lies in their calculation thus they will lose utility 
points on the other hand if they discard the false values 
the self-interested agents send that is they do not 
incorporate the lies they will gain utility values formally we use 
us 
to denote the utility of the self-interested agents and ug 
to denote the utility of the regular gossip agents we also 
denote the strategy profile in the game as ts tg the 
utility functions are defined as 
us 
 
 if ts ≥ tg 
ts − tavg if ts tg 
 
ug 
 
tg − tavg if ts ≥ tg 
ts − tg if ts tg 
 
we are interested in finding the nash equilibrium we 
recall from that the nash equilibrium is a strategy 
profile where no player has anything to gain by deviating from 
his strategy given that the other agent follows his strategy 
profile formally let s u denote the game where s is 
the set of strategy profiles and u is the set of utility 
functions when each agent i ∈ regular gossip self-interested 
chooses a strategy ti resulting in a strategy profile t 
 ts tg then agent i obtains a utility of ui 
 t a strategy 
profile t 
∈ s is a nash equilibrium if no deviation in the 
strategy by any single agent is profitable that is if for all i 
ui 
 t 
 ≥ ui 
 ti t 
−i that is ts tg is a nash equilibrium 
if the self-interested agents have no other value ts such that 
us 
 ts tg us 
 ts tg and similarly for the gossip agents 
we now have the following theorem 
theorem tavg tavg is the only nash equilibrium 
proof first we will show that tavg tavg is a nash 
equilibrium assume by contradiction that the gossip agents 
choose another value tg tavg thus ug 
 tavg tg 
tavg − tg on the other hand ug

deviate from this strategy the self-interested agents also have 
no incentive to deviate from this strategy by

the above theorem proves that the equilibrium point is 
reached only when the self-interested agents send the time 
to traverse certain edges equals the average time and on 
the other hand the regular gossip agents discard all data 
regarding roads that are associated with an average time or 
higher thus for this equilibrium point the exchange of 
gossiping information between agents is inefficient as the gossip 
agents are unable to detect any anomalies in the network 
in the next section we describe another scenario for the 
self-interested agents in which they are not concerned with 
their own utility but rather interested in maximizing the 
average journey length of other gossip agents 
 spreading lies causing chaos 
another possible behavior that can be adopted by 
selfinterested agents is characterized by their goal to cause 
disorder in the network this can be achieved for example by 
maximizing the average journey length of all agents even at 
the cost of maximizing their own journey length 
to understand the vulnerability of the gossip based 
transportation support system we ran different simulations for 
each scenario in each simulation different agents were 
randomly chosen using a uniform distribution to act as 
gossip agents among them self-interested agents were chosen 
each self-interested agent behaved in the same manner as 
described in section 
every simulation consisted of runs with each run 
comprising different numbers of self-interested agents no 
selfinterested agents and 
also in each run the number of self-interested agents was 
increased incrementally for example the run with 
selfinterested agents consisted of all the self-interested agents 
that were used in the run with self-interested agents but 
with an additional self-interested agents 
tables and summarize the normalized journey length 
for the self-interested agents the regular gossip agents and 
the regular non-gossip agents table summarizes the 
data for the first iteration and table summarizes the data 
for the average of all iterations figure demonstrates 
the changes in the normalized values for the regular gossip 
agents and the regular agents as a function of the iteration 
number similar to the results in our first set of experiments 
described in section we can see that randomly selected 
self-interested agents who follow different randomly selected 
routes do not benefit from their malicious behavior that is 
their average journey length does not decrease however 
when only one self-interested agent is involved it does 
benefit from the malicious behavior even in the first iteration 
the results also indicate that the regular gossip agents are 
more sensitive to malicious behavior than regular 
agentsthe average journey length for the gossip agents increases 
significantly e g with self-interested agents the average 
journey length for the gossip agents was higher than 
in the setting with no self-interested agents at all as 
opposed to an increase of only for the regular agents in 
contrast these results also indicate that the self-interested 
agents do not succeed in causing a significant load in the 
network by their malicious behavior

since the goal of the self-interested agents in this case is 
to cause disorder in the network rather than use the lies for 
their own benefits the question arises as to why would the 
behavior of the self-interested agents be to send lies about 
their routes only furthermore we hypothesize that if they 
all send lies about the same major roads the damage they 
might inflict on the entire network would be larger that had 
each of them sent lies about its own route to examine this 
hypothesis we designed another set of experiments in this 
set of experiments all the self-interested agents spread lies 
about the same main roads in the network however the 
results show quite a smaller impact on other gossip and

lar agents in the network the average normalized value for 
the gossip agents in these simulations was only about 
as opposed to in the original scenario when analyzing 
the results we saw that although the false data was spread 
it did not cause other gossip cars to change their route the 
main reason was that the lies were spread on roads that were 
not on the route of the self-interested agents thus it took 
the data longer to reach agents on the main roads and when 
the agents reached the relevant roads this data was too old 
to be incorporated in the other agents calculations 
we also examined the impact of sending lies in order to 
cause chaos when there are already congestions in the 
network to this end we simulated a network in which main 
roads are jammed the behavior of the self-interested agents 
is as described in section and the self-interested agents 
spread lies about their own route the simulation results 
detailed in table show that there is a greater incentive 
for the self-interested agents to cheat when the network is 
already congested as their cheating causes more damage 
to the other agents in the network for example whereas 
the average journey length of the regular agents increased 
only by about in the original scenario in which the 
network was not congested in this scenario the average journey 
length of the agents had increased by about 
 conclusions 
in this paper we investigated the benefits achieved by 
self-interested agents in vehicular networks using 
simulations we investigated two behaviors that might be taken 
by self-interested agents a trying to minimize their 
journey length and b trying to cause chaos in the network 
our simulations indicate that in both behaviors the 
selfinterested agents have only limited success achieving their 
goal even if no counter-measures are taken this is in 
contrast to the greater impact inflicted by self-interested agents 
in other domains e g e-commerce some reasons for this 
are the special characteristics of vehicular networks and their 
dynamic nature while the self-interested agents spread lies 
they cannot choose which agents with whom they will 
interact also by the time their lies reach other agents they 
might become irrelevant as more recent data has reached 
the same agents 
motivated by the simulation results future research in 
this field will focus on modeling different behaviors of the 
self-interested agents which might cause more damage to 
the network another research direction would be to find 
ways of minimizing the effect of selfish-agents by using 
distributed reputation or other measures
