 introduction 
we consider a multiagent system where each distributed 
agent locally perceives its environment and we assume that 
some unexpected event occurs in that system if each agent 
computes only locally its favoured hypothesis it is only 
natural to assume that agents will seek to coordinate and 
refine their hypotheses by confronting their observations with 
other agents if in addition the communication 
opportunities are severely constrained for instance agents can 
only communicate when they are close enough to some other 
agent and dynamically changing for instance agents may 
change their locations it becomes crucial to carefully 
design protocols that will allow agents to converge to some 
desired state of global consistency in this paper we 
exhibit some sufficient conditions on the system dynamics and 
on the protocol strategy structures that allow to guarantee 
that property and we experimentally study some contexts 
where some of these assumptions are relaxed 
while problems of diagnosis are among the venerable 
classics in the ai tradition their multiagent counterparts have 
much more recently attracted some attention roos and 
colleagues in particular study a situation where a number 
of distributed entities try to come up with a satisfying global 
diagnosis of the whole system they show in particular that 
the number of messages required to establish this global 
diagnosis is bound to be prohibitive unless the communication 
is enhanced with some suitable protocol however they do 
not put any restrictions on agents communication options 
and do not assume either that the system is dynamic 
the benefits of enhancing communication with supporting 
information to make convergence to a desired global state 
of a system more efficient has often been put forward in the 
literature this is for instance one of the main idea 
underlying the argumentation-based negotiation approach where 
the desired state is a compromise between agents with 
conflicting preferences many of these works however make the 
assumption that this approach is beneficial to start with 
and study the technical facets of the problem or instead 
emphasize other advantages of using argumentation 
notable exceptions are the works of which studied in 
contexts different from ours the efficiency of argumentation 
the rest of the paper is as follows section specifies 
the basic elements of our model and section goes on to 
presenting the different protocols and strategies used by the 
agents to exchange hypotheses and observations we put 
special attention at clearly emphasizing the conditions on 
the system dynamics and protocols strategies that will be 
exploited in the rest of the paper section details one of 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
the main results of the paper namely the fact that under the 
aforementioned conditions the constraints that we put on 
the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system 
towards global consistency at the condition that no agent 
ever gets completely lost forever in the system and that 
unlimited time is allowed for computation and argument 
exchange while the conditions on protocols and strategies are 
fairly mild it is also clear that these system requirements 
look much more problematic even frankly unrealistic in 
critical situations where distributed approaches are precisely 
advocated to get a clearer picture of the situation induced 
when time is a critical factor we have set up an 
experimental framework that we introduce and discuss in section 
the critical situation involves a number of agents aiming 
at escaping from a burning building the results reported 
here show that the effectiveness of argument exchange 
crucially depends upon the nature of the building and provide 
some insights regarding the design of optimal protocol for 
hypotheses refinement in this context 
 basic notions 
we start by defining the basic elements of our system 
environment 
let o be the potentially infinite set of possible 
observations we assume the sensors of our agents to be perfect 
hence the observations to be certain let h be the set of 
hypotheses uncertain and revisable let cons h o be the 
consistency relation a binary relation between a hypothesis 
h ∈ h and a set of observations o ⊆ o in most cases cons 
will refer to classical consistency relation however we may 
overload its meaning and add some additional properties to 
that relation in which case we will mention it 
the environment may include some dynamics and change 
over the course of time we define below sequences of time 
points to deal with it 
definition sequence of time points a 
sequence of time points t t tn from t is an ordered 
set of time points t t tn such that t ≥ t and 
∀i ∈ n − ti ≥ ti 
agent 
we take a system populated by n agents a an each 
agent is defined as a tuple f oi hi where 
 f the set of facts common knowledge to all agents 
 oi ∈ o 
 the set of observations made by the agent 
so far we assume a perfect memory hence this set 
grows monotonically 
 hi ∈ h the favourite hypothesis of the agent 
a key notion governing the formation of hypotheses is that 
of consistency defined below 
definition consistency we say that 
 an agent is consistent cons ai iff cons hi oi 
 that is its hypothesis is consistent with its 
observation set 
 an agent ai consistent with a partner agent aj iff 
cons ai and cons hi oj that is this agent is 
consistent and its hypothesis can explain the observation 
set of the other agent 
 two agents ai and aj are mutually consistent 
 mcons ai aj iff cons ai aj and cons aj ai 
 a system is consistent iff ∀ i j ∈ n 
it is the case 
that mcons ai aj 
to ensure its consistency each agent is equipped with an 
abstract reasoning machinery that we shall call the 
explanation function eh this deterministic function takes a 
set of observation and returns a single prefered hypothesis 
 o 
→ h we assume h eh o to be consistent with 
o by definition of eh so using this function on its 
observation set to determine its favourite hypothesis is a sure way 
for the agent to achieve consistency note however that an 
hypothesis does not need to be generated by eh to be 
consistent with an observation set as a concrete example of such 
a function and one of the main inspiration of this work 
one can cite the theorist reasoning system -as long as 
it is coupled with a filter selecting a single prefered theory 
among the ones initially selected by theorist 
note also that hi may only be modified as a consequence 
of the application eh we refer to this as the autonomy of the 
agent no other agent can directly impose a given 
hypothesis to an agent as a consequence only a new observation 
 being it a new perception or an observation communicated 
by a fellow agent can result in a modification of its prefered 
hypothesis hi but not necessarily of course 
we finally define a property of the system that we shall 
use in the rest of the paper 
definition bounded perceptions a system 
involves a bounded perception for agents iff ∃n s t 
∀t ∪n 
i oi ≤ n that is the number of observations to 
be made by the agents in the system is not infinite 
agent cycle 
now we need to see how these agents will evolve and interact 
in their environment in our context agents evolve in a 
dynamic environment and we classicaly assume the following 
system cycle 
 environment dynamics the environment evolves 
according to the defined rules of the system dynamics 
 perception step agents get perceptions from the 
environment these perceptions are typically partial e g 
the agent can only see a portion of a map 
 reasoning step agents compare perception with 
predictions seek explanations for potential 
difference s refine their hypothesis draw new conclusions 
 communication step agents can communicate 
hypotheses and observations with other agents through 
a defined protocol any agent can only be involved in 
one communication with another agent by step 
 action step agents do some practical reasoning using 
the models obtained from the previous steps and select 
an action they can then modify the environment by 
executing it 
the communication of the agents will be further 
constrained by topological consideration at a given time an 
agent will only be able to communicate with a number of 
neighbours its connexions with these others agents may 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
evolve with its situation in the environment typically an 
agent can only communicate with agents that it can sense 
but one could imagine evolving topological constraints on 
communication based on a network of communications 
between agents where the links are not always active 
communication 
in our system agents will be able to communicate with each 
other however due to the aforementionned topological 
constraints they will not be able to communicate with any 
agents at anytime who an agent can communicate with 
will be defined dynamically for instance this can be a 
consequence of the agents being close enough to get in touch 
we will abstractly denote by c ai aj t the communication 
property in other words the fact that agents ai and aj can 
communicate at time t note that this relation is assumed 
to be symetric but of course not transitive we are now in 
a position to define two essential properties of our system 
definition temporal path there exists a 
temporal communication path at horizon tf noted ltf ai aj 
between ai and aj iff there exists a sequence of time points 
t t tn from tf and a sequence of agents k k kn 
s t i c ai ak t ii c akn aj tn iii ∀i ∈ n 
c aki aki ti 
intuitively what this property says is that it is possible to 
find a temporal path in the future that would allow to link 
agent ai and aj via a sequence of intermediary agents note 
that the time points are not necessarily successive and that 
the sequence of agents may involve the same agents several 
times 
definition temporal connexity a system is 
temporaly connex iff ∀t ∀ i j ∈ n 
lt ai aj 
in short a temporaly connex system guarantees that any 
agent will be able to communicate with any other agents 
no matter how long it might take to do so at any time to 
put it another way it is never the case that an agent will be 
isolated for ever from another agent of the system 
we will next discuss the detail of how communication 
concretely takes place in our system remember that in this 
paper we only consider the case of bilateral exchanges an 
agent can only speak to a single other agent and that we 
also assume that any agent can only engage in a single 
exchange in a given round 
 protocols and strategies 
in this section we discuss the requirements of the 
interaction protocols that govern the exchange of messages between 
agents and provide some example instantiation of such 
protocols to clarify the presentation we distinguish two 
levels the local level which is concerned with the regulation 
of bilateral exchanges and the global level which essentially 
regulates the way agents can actually engage into a 
conversation at each level we separate what is specified by the 
protocol and what is left to agents strategies 
local protocol and strategies 
we start by inspecting local protocols and strategies that 
will regulate the communication between the agents of the 
system as we limit ourselves to bilateral communication 
these protocols will simply involve two agents such protocol 
will have to meet one basic requirement to be satisfying 
 consistency cons - a local protocol has to 
guarantee the mutual consistency of agents upon termination 
 which implies termination of course 
figure a hypotheses exchange protocol 
one example such protocol is the protocol described in 
that is pictured in fig to further illustrate how such 
protocol can be used by agents we give some details on a 
possible strategy upon receiving a hypothesis h propose h or 
counterpropose h from a agent a is in state and has 
the following possible replies counterexample if the agent 
knows an example contradicting the hypothesis or not 
explained by this hypothesis challenge if the agents lacks 
evidence to accept this hypothesis counterpropose if the 
agent agrees with the hypothesis but prefers another one 
or accept if it is indeed as good as its favourite 
hypothesis this strategy guarantees among other properties the 
eventual mutual logical consistency of the involved agents 
 
global protocol 
the global protocol regulates the way bilateral exchanges 
will be initiated between agents at each turn agents will 
concurrently send one weighted request to communicate to 
other agents this weight is a value measuring the agent s 
willingness to converse with the targeted agent in practice 
this can be based on different heuristics but we shall make 
some assumptions on agents strategies see below sending 
such a request is a kind of conditional commitment for the 
agent an agent sending a weighted request commits to 
engage in conversation with the target if he does not receive 
and accept himself another request once all request have 
been received each agent replies with either an acccept or 
a reject by answering with an accept an agent makes a 
full commitment to engage in conversation with the sender 
therefore it can only send one accept in a given round as an 
agent can only participate in one conversation per time step 
when all response have been received each agent receiving 
an accept can either initiate a conversation using the local 
protocol or send a cancel if it has accepted another request 
at the end of all the bilateral exchanges the agents 
engaged in conversation are discarded from the protocol then 
each of the remaining agents resends a request and the 
process iterates until no more requests are sent 
global strategy 
we now define four requirements for the strategies used by 
agents depending on their role in the protocol two are 
concerned with the requestee role how to decide who the 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
agent wishes to communicate with the other two with the 
responder role how to decide which communication request 
to accept or not 
 willingness to solve inconsistancies solve -agents 
want to communicate with any other agents unless 
they know they are mutually consistent 
 focus on solving inconsistencies focus -agents do 
not request communication with an agent with whom 
they know they are mutually consistent 
 willingness to communicate comm -agents cannot 
refuse a weighted communication request unless they 
have just received or send a request with a greater 
weight 
 commitment to communication request 
 requ agents cannot accept a weighted communication 
request if they have themselves sent a communication 
request with a greater weight therefore they will 
not cancel their request unless they have received a 
communicational request with greater weight 
now the protocol structure together with the properties 
comm requ ensure that a request can only be rejected 
if its target agent engages in communication with another 
agent suppose indeed that agent ai wants to communicate 
with aj by sending a request with weight w comm 
guarantees that an agent receiving a weighted request will either 
accept this communication accept a communication with a 
greater weight or wait for the answer to a request with a 
greater weight this ensures that the request with 
maximal weight will be accepted and not cancelled as requ 
ensures that an agent sending a request can only cancel it if 
he accepts another request with greater weight therefore 
at least two agents will engage in conversation per round 
of the global protocol as the protocol ensures that ai can 
resend its request while aj is not engaged in a conversation 
there will be a turn in which aj must engage in a 
conversation either with ai or another agent 
these requirements concern request sending and 
acceptation but agents also need some strategy of weight 
attribution we describe below an altruist strategy used in our 
experiments being cooperative an agent may want to know 
more of the communication wishes of other agents in order to 
improve the overall allocation of exchanges to agents a 
context request step is then added to the global protocol before 
sending their chosen weighted request agents attribute a 
weight to all agents they are prepared to communicate with 
according to some internal factors in the simplest case this 
weight will be for all agent with whom the agent is not 
sure of being mutually consistent ensuring solve other 
agent being not considered for communication ensuring 
focus the agent then sends a context request to all agents 
with whom communication is considered this request also 
provides information about the sender list of considered 
communications along with their weight after reception 
of all the context requests agents will either reply with a 
deny iff they are already engaged in a conversation in which 
case the requesting agent will not consider communication 
with them anymore in this turn or an inform giving the 
requester information about the requests it has sent and 
received when all replies have been received each agent can 
calculate the weight of all requests concerning it it does so 
by substracting from the weight of its request the weight of 
all requests concerning either it or its target that is the 
final weight of the request from ai to aj is wi j wi j wj i − 
 
p 
k∈r i − j wi k 
p 
k∈s i − j wk i 
p 
k∈r j − i wj k 
p 
k∈s j − i wk j where wi j is the weight of the request of 
ai to aj r i is the set of indice of agents having received a 
request from ai and s i is the set of indice of agents 
having send a request to ai it then finally sends a weighted 
request to the agents who maximise this weight or wait for 
a request as described in the global protocol 
 conditional convergence to 
global consistency 
in this section we will show that the requirements 
regarding protocols and strategies just discussed will be sufficient 
to ensure that the system will eventually converge towards 
global consistency under some conditions we first show 
that if two agents are not mutually consistent at some time 
then there will be necessarily a time in the future such that 
an agent will learn a new observation being it because it is 
new for the system or by learning it from another agent 
lemma let s be a system populated by n agents 
a a an temporaly connex and involving bounded 
perceptions for these agents let n be the sum of 
cardinalities of the intersection of pairwise observation sets 
 n 
p 
 i j ∈ n oi ∩ oj let n be the cardinality of 
the union of all agents observations sets n ∪n 
i oi 
if ¬mcons ai aj at time t there is necessarily a time 
t t s t either n or n will increase 
proof suppose that there exist a time t 
and indices i j s t ¬mcons ai aj we will 
use mt 
p 
 k l ∈ n εcomm ak al t where 
εcomm ak al t if ak and al have 
communicated at least once since t and otherwise 
temporal connexity guarantees that there exist t tm 
and k km s t c ai ak t c akm aj tm and 
∀p ∈ m c akp akp tp clearly if mcons ai ak 
mcons akm aj and ∀p mcons akp akp we have 
mcons ai aj which contradicts our hypothesis mcons 
being transitive mcons ai ak ∧mcons ak ak implies 
that mcons ai ak and so on till mcons ai akm ∧ 
mcons akm aj which implies mcons ai aj 
at least two agents are then necessarily 
inconsistent ¬mcons ai ak or ¬mcons akm aj or ∃p t q 
¬mcons akp 
 akp let ak and al be these two 
neighbours at a time t t 
 
 the solve property ensures 
that either ak or al will send a communication request to 
the other agent at time t as shown before this in turn 
ensures that at least one of these agents will be involved in 
a communication then there are two possibilities 
 case i ak and al communicate at time t in this case 
we know that ¬mcons ak al this and the cons 
property ensures that at least one of the agents must change its 
 
strictly speaking the transitivity of mcons only ensure 
that ak and al are inconsistent at a time t ≥ t that can 
be different from the time t at which they can 
communicate but if they become consistent between t and t or 
inconsistent between t and t it means that at least one 
of them have changed its hypothesis between t and t that 
is after t we can then apply the reasoning of case iib 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
hypothesis which in turn since agents are autonomous 
implies at least one exchange of observation but then ok ∩ol 
is bound to increase n t n t 
 case ii ak communicates with ap at time t we then have 
again two possibilities 
 case iia ak and ap did not communicate since t but then 
εcomm ak ap t had value and takes value hence mt 
increases 
 case iib ak and ap did communicate at some time t 
t the cons property of the protocol ensures that 
mcons ak ap at that time now the fact that they 
communicate and focus implies that at least one of them did 
change its hypothesis in the meantime the fact that agents 
are autonomous implies in turn that a new observation 
 perceived or received from another agent necessarily provoked 
this change the latter case would ensure the existence of a 
time t t and an agent aq s t either op ∩oq or ok ∩oq 
increases of at that time implying n t n t the 
former case means that the agent gets a new perception o 
at time t if that observation was unknown in the system 
before then n t n t if some agent aq already knew 
this observation before then either op ∩ oq or ok ∩ oq 
increases of at time t which implies that n t n t 
hence ¬mcons ai aj at time t guarantees that either 
−∃t t t q n t n t or 
−∃t t t q n t n t or 
−∃t t t q mt increases of at time t 
by iterating the reasoning with t but keeping t as the 
time reference for mt we can eliminate the third case 
 mt is integer and bounded by n 
 which means that 
after a maximum of n 
iterations we necessarily will be in 
one of two other cases as a result we have proven that if 
¬mcons ai aj at time t there is necessarily a time t s t 
either n or n will increase 
theorem global consistency let s be a 
system populated by n agents a a an temporaly connex 
and involving bounded perceptions for these agents let 
cons ai aj be a transitive consistency property then any 
protocol and strategies satisfying properties cons solve 
focus comm and requ guarantees that the system will 
converge towards global consistency 
proof for the sake of contradiction let us assume 
∃i j ∈ n s t ∀t ∃t t t q ¬cons ai aj t 
using the lemma this implies that ∃t t s t either 
n t n t or n t n t but we can apply 
the same reasoning taking t t which would give us 
t t t s t ¬cons ai aj t which gives us t t 
s t either n t n t or n t n t by 
successive iterations we can then construct a sequence t t tn 
which can be divided in two sub-sequences t t tn and 
t t tn s t n t n t n tn and 
n t n t n tn one of these sub-sequences 
has to be infinite however n ti and n ti are strictly 
growing integer and bounded which implies that both are 
finite contradiction 
what the previous result essentially shows is that in a 
system where no agent will be isolated from the rest of the 
agents for ever only very mild assumptions on the protocols 
and strategies used by agents suffice to guarantee 
convergence towards system consistency in a finite amount of time 
 although it might take very long unfortunately in many 
critical situations it will not be possible to assume this 
temporal connexity as distributed approaches as the one 
advocated in this paper are precisely often presented as a 
good way to tackle problems of reliability or problems of 
dependence to a center that are of utmost importance in these 
critical applications it is certainly interesting to further 
explore how such a system would behave when we relax this 
assumption 
 experimental study 
this experiment involves agents trying to escape from a 
burning building the environment is described as a spatial 
grid with a set of walls and thankfully some exits time 
and space are considered discrete time is divided in rounds 
agents are localised by their position on the spatial grid 
these agents can move and communicate with other agents 
in a round an agent can move of one cell in any of the four 
cardinal directions provided it is not blocked by a wall in 
this application agents communicate with any other agent 
 but recall a single one given that this agent is in view 
and that they have not yet exchanged their current favoured 
hypothesis suddenly a fire erupts in these premises from 
this moment the fire propagates each round for each cases 
where there is fire the fire propagates in the four directions 
however the fire cannot propagate through a wall if the 
fire propagates in a case where an agent is positioned that 
agent burns and is considered dead it can of course no 
longer move nor communicate if an agent gets to an exit 
it is considered saved and can no longer be burned agents 
know the environment and the rules governing the 
dynamics of this environment that is they know the map as well 
as the rules of fire propagation previously described they 
also locally perceive this environment but cannot see 
further than cases away in any direction walls also block 
the line of view preventing agents from seeing behind them 
within their sight they can see other agents and whether 
or not the cases they see are on fire all these perceptions 
are memorised 
we now show how this instantiates the abstract 
framework presented the paper 
 o fire x y t nofire x y t agent ai x y t 
observations can then be positive o ∈ p o iff ∃h ∈ 
h s t h o or negative o ∈ n o iff ∃h ∈ h s t 
h ¬o

hypotheses are conjunctions of fireorigins 
 cons h o consistency relation satisfies 
- coherence ∀o ∈ n o h ¬o 
- completeness ∀o ∈ p o h o 
- minimality for all h ∈ h if h is coherent and 
complete for o then h is prefered to h according 
to the preference relation h ≤p h 
 
selects first the minimal number of origins then the most 
recent least preemptive strategy then uses some 
arbitrary fixed ranking to discriminate ex-aequo the resulting 
relation is a total order hence minimality implies that there 
will be a single h s t cons o h for a given o this in 
turn means that mcons ai aj iff cons ai cons aj and 
hi hj this relation is then transitive and symmetric 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 eh takes o as argument and returns min≤p of the 
coherent and complete hypothesis for o 
 experimental evaluation 
we will classically see e g assess the effectiveness 
and efficiency of different interaction protocols 
effectiveness of a protocol 
the proportion of agents surviving the fire over the initial 
number of agents involved in the experiment will determine 
the effectiveness of a given protocol if this value is high 
the protocol has been effective to propagate the information 
and or for the agents to refine their hypotheses and 
determine the best way to the exit 
efficiency of a protocol 
typically the use of supporting information will involve a 
communication overhead we will assume here that the 
efficiency of a given protocol is characterised by the data flow 
induced by this protocol in this paper we will only discuss 
this aspect wrt local protocols the main measure that we 
shall then use here is the mean total size of messages that 
are exchanged by agents per exchange hence taking into 
account both the number of messages and the actual size of the 
messages because it could be that messages happen to be 
very big containing e g a large number of observations 
which could counter-balance a low number of messages 
 experimental settings 
the chosen experimental settings are the following 
 environmental topology- performances of 
information propagation are highly constrained by the 
environment topology the perception skills of the agents 
depend on the openness of the environment with 
a large number of walls the perceptions of agents are 
limited and also the number of possible inter-agent 
communications whereas an open environment will 
provide optimal possibilities of perception and 
information propagation thus we propose a topological 
index see below as a common basis to charaterize the 
environments maps used during experimentations 
the topological index ti is the ratio of the number of 
cells that can be perceived by agents summed up from 
all possible positions divided by the number of cells 
that would be perceived from the same positions but 
without any walls the closer to the more open the 
environment we shall also use two additional more 
classical measures the characteristic path length 
 cpl and the clustering coefficient 
 cc 
 number of agents- the propagation of information 
also depends on the initial number of agents involved 
during an experimentation for instance the more 
agents the more potential communications there is 
this means that there will be more potential for 
propagation but also that the bilateral exchange restriction 
will be more crucial 
 
the cpl is the median of the means of the shortest path 
lengths connecting each node to all other nodes 
 
characterising the isolation degree of a region of an 
environment in terms of acessibility number of roads still usable 
to reach this region

 initial positions of the agents- initial positions of the 
agents have a significant influence on the overall 
behavior of an instance of our system being close from 
an exit will in general ease the escape 
 experimental environments 
we choose to realize experiments on three very 
different topological indexes for open environments 
for mixed environments and for labyrinth-like 
environments 
figure two maps left ti right ti 
we designed three different maps for each index fig 
shows two of them containing the same maximum number 
of agents agents max with a maximum density of one 
agent per cell the same number of exits and a similar fire 
origin e g starting time and position the three differents 
maps of a given index are designed as follows the first map 
is a model of an existing building floor the second map has 
the same enclosure exits and fire origin as the first one 
but the number and location of walls are different wall 
locations are designed by an heuristic which randomly creates 
walls on the spatial grid such that no fully closed rooms are 
created and that no exit is closed the third map is 
characterised by geometrical enclosure in wich walls location 
is also designed with the aforementioned heuristic table 
summarizes the different topological measures 
characterizing these different maps it is worth pointing out that the 
values confirm the relevance of ti maps with a high ti 
have a low cpl and a high cc however the cpl and cc 
allows to further refine the difference between the maps e g 
between - and - 
 experimental results 
for each triple of maps defined as above we conduct the 
same experiments in each experiment the society differs in 
terms of its initial proportion of involved agents from 
to this initial proportion represents the percentage 
of involved agents with regards to the possible maximum 
number of agents for each map and each initial proportion 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
we select randomly different initial agents locations 
for each of those different locations we execute the system 
one time for each different interaction protocol 
effectiveness of communication and argumentation 
the first experiment that we set up aims at testing how 
effective is hypotheses exchange he and in particular how 
the topological aspects will affect this effectiveness in order 
to do so we have computed the ratio of improvement offered 
by that protocol over a situation where agents could simply 
not communicate no comm to get further insights as 
to what extent the hypotheses exchange was really crucial 
we also tested a much less elaborated protocol consisting 
of mere observation exchanges oe more precisely this 
protocol requires that each agent stores any unexpected 
observation that it perceives and agents simply exchange 
their respective lists of observations when they discuss in 
this case the local protocol is different note in 
particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency but the 
global protocol remains the same at the only exception that 
agents motivation to communicate is to synchronise their 
list of observations not their hypothesis if this protocol is 
at best as effective as he it has the advantage of being more 
efficient this is obvious wrt the number of messages which 
will be limited to less straightforward as far as the size of 
messages is concerned but the rough observation that the 
exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version 
of the challenge is helpful to see this the results of these 
experiments are reported in fig 
figure comparative effectiveness ratio gain of 
protocols when the proportion of agents augments 
the first observation that needs to be made is that 
communication improves the effectiveness of the process and 
this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the 
system the second lesson that we learn here is that 
closeness relatively makes communication more effective over non 
communication maps exhibiting a t i of are 
constantly above the two others and are still slightly but 
significantly better than however these curves also 
suggest perhaps surprisingly that he outperforms oe in 
precisely those situations where the ratio gain is less 
important the only noticeable difference occurs for rather open 
maps where t i is this may be explained as follows 
when a map is open agents have many potential explanation 
candidates and argumentation becomes useful to 
discriminate between those when a map is labyrinth-like there are 
fewer possible explanations to an unexpected event 
importance of the global protocol 
the second set of experiments seeks to evaluate the 
importance of the design of the global protocol we tested our 
protocol against a local broadcast lb protocol local 
broadcast means that all the neighbours agents perceived 
by an agent will be involved in a communication with that 
agent in a given round -we alleviate the constraint of a 
single communication by agent this gives us a rough upper 
bound upon the possible ratio gain in the system for a given 
local protocol again we evaluated the ratio gain induced 
by that lb over our classical he for the three different 
classes of maps the results are reported in fig 
figure ratio gain of local broadcast over 
hypotheses exchange 
note to begin with that the ratio gain is when the 
proportion of agents is which is easily explained by the fact 
that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents 
we first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio 
gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments the 
gain reaches to depending on the class of maps 
considered if one compares this with the improvement reported 
in the previous experiment it appears to be of the same 
magnitude this illustrates that the design of the global 
protocol cannot be ignored especially when the proportion 
of agents is high however we also note that the 
effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both 
cases the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol 
increases very quickly with the proportion of agents while 
the curve is really smooth for the global one 
now let us observe more carefully the results reported 
here the curve corresponding to a ti of is above that 
corresponding to this is so because the more open 
a map the more opportunities to communicate with more 
than one agent and hence benefits from broadcast 
however we also observe that curve for is below that for 
 this is explained as follows in the case of the 
potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is 
much lower because our protocols already give rather 
efficient outcomes anyway quickly reaching see fig 
a simple rule of thumb could be that when the number of 
agents is small special attention should be put on the local 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
protocol whereas when that number is large one should 
carefully design the global one unless the map is so open 
that the protocol is already almost optimally efficient 
efficiency of the protocols 
the final experiment reported here is concerned with the 
analysis of the efficiency of the protocols we analysis here 
the mean size of the totality of the messages that are 
exchanged by agents mean size of exchanges for short using 
the following protocols he oe and two variant 
protocols the first one is an intermediary restricted hypotheses 
exchange protocol rhe rhe is as follows it does not 
involve any challenge nor counter-propose which means that 
agents cannot switch their role during the protocol this 
differs from re in that respect in short rhe allows an agent 
to exhaust its partner s criticism and eventually this 
partner will come to adopt the agent s hypothesis note that this 
means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here 
 as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot 
undermine with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be 
significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness the 
second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange 
protocol coe coe uses the same principles as oe but 
includes in addition all critical negative examples nofire in 
the exchange thus giving all examples used as arguments 
by the hypotheses exchanges protocol hence improving 
effectiveness results for map - are shown on fig 
figure mean size of exchanges 
first we can observe the fact that the ordering of the 
protocols from the least efficient to the most efficient is coe 
he rhe and then oe he being more efficient than coe 
proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by 
selecting when it is needed to provide negative example which 
have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed 
however by communicating hypotheses before eventually 
giving observation to support it he instead of directly 
giving the most crucial observations oe the argumentation 
process doubles the size of data exchanges it is the cost for 
ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange a property 
that oe does not support also significant is the fact the 
the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the 
number of agents is small this is explained by the fact that in 
these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations 
in their possession and that they will need to communicate 
a lot in order to come up with a common view of the 
situation when the number of agents increases this knowledge 
is distributed over more agents which need shorter 
discussions to get to mutual consistency as a consequence the 
relative gain in efficiency of using rhe appears to be better 
when the number of agents is small when it is high they 
will hardly argue anyway finally it is worth noticing that 
the standard deviation for these experiments is rather high 
which means that the conversation do not converge to any 
stereotypic pattern 
 conclusion 
this paper has investigated the properties of a 
multiagent system where each distributed agent locally perceives 
its environment and tries to reach consistency with other 
agents despite severe communication restrictions in 
particular we have exhibited conditions allowing convergence and 
experimentally investigated a typical situation where those 
conditions cannot hold there are many possible extensions 
to this work the first being to further investigate the 
properties of different global protocols belonging to the class we 
identified and their influence on the outcome there are in 
particular many heuristics highly dependent on the context 
of the study that could intuitively yield interesting results 
 in our study selecting the recipient on the basis of what can 
be inferred from his observed actions could be such a 
heuristic one obvious candidate for longer term issues concern 
the relaxation of the assumption of perfect sensing
