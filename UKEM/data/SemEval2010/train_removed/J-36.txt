abstract 
in traditional game theory players are typically endowed 
with exogenously given knowledge of the structure of the 
game-either full omniscient knowledge or partial but fixed 
information in real life however people are often unaware 
of the utility of taking a particular action until they perform 
research into its consequences in this paper we model this 
phenomenon we imagine a player engaged in a 
questionand-answer session asking questions both about his or her 
own preferences and about the state of reality thus we call 
this setting socratic game theory in a socratic game 
players begin with an a priori probability distribution over 
many possible worlds with a different utility function for 
each world players can make queries at some cost to learn 
partial information about which of the possible worlds is the 
actual world before choosing an action we consider two 
query models an unobservable-query model in which 
players learn only the response to their own queries and 
 an observable-query model in which players also learn 
which queries their opponents made 
the results in this paper consider cases in which the 
underlying worlds of a two-player socratic game are either 
constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games a class 
that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in 
which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction 
between the players when the underlying worlds are 
constant sum we give polynomial-time algorithms to find nash 
equilibria in both the observable- and unobservable-query 
models when the worlds are strategically zero sum we give 
efficient algorithms to find nash equilibria in 
unobservablequery socratic games and correlated equilibria in

 introduction 
late october a smoky room democratic party 
strategists huddle around a map how should the kennedy 
campaign allocate its remaining advertising budget should 
it focus on say california or new york the nixon 
campaign faces the same dilemma of course neither campaign 
knows the effectiveness of its advertising in each state 
perhaps californians are susceptible to nixon s advertising but 
are unresponsive to kennedy s in light of this uncertainty 
the kennedy campaign may conduct a survey at some cost 
to estimate the effectiveness of its advertising moreover the 
larger-and more expensive-the survey the more accurate 
it will be is the cost of a survey worth the information that 
it provides how should one balance the cost of acquiring 
more information against the risk of playing a game with 
higher uncertainty 
in this paper we model situations of this type as socratic 
games as in traditional game theory the players in a 
socratic game choose actions to maximize their payoffs but we 
model players with incomplete information who can make 
costly queries to reduce their uncertainty about the state of 
the world before they choose their actions this approach 
contrasts with traditional game theory in which players are 
usually modeled as having fixed exogenously given 
information about the structure of the game and its payoffs in 
traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information 
there is information that the players do not have in socratic 
games unlike in these games the players have a chance to 
acquire the missing information at some cost a number of 
related models have been explored by economists and 
computer scientists motivated by similar situations often with 
a focus on mechanism design and auctions a sampling of 
this research includes the work of larson and sandholm 
 parkes fong compte and jehiel 
rezende persico and matthews cr´emer and 
khalil rasmusen and bergemann and v¨alim¨aki 
 the model of bergemann and v¨alim¨aki is similar in 
many regards to the one that we explore here see section 
for some discussion 
a socratic game proceeds as follows a real world is 
cho 
sen randomly from a set of possible worlds according to a 
common prior distribution each player then selects an 
arbitrary query from a set of available costly queries and 
receives a corresponding piece of information about the real 
world finally each player selects an action and receives a 
payoff-a function of the players selected actions and the 
identity of the real world-less the cost of the query that 
he or she made compared to traditional game theory the 
distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of 
explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial 
information about which of the many possible worlds is the 
real world 
our research was initially inspired by recent results in 
psychology on decision making but it soon became clear that 
socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding 
the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff well studied 
in machine learning in a strategic multiplayer environment 
this tension between the risk arising from uncertainty and 
the cost of acquiring information is ubiquitous in economics 
political science and beyond 
our results we consider socratic games under two 
models an unobservable-query model where players learn only 
the response to their own queries and an observable-query 
model where players also learn which queries their opponents 
made we give efficient algorithms to find nash 
equilibriai e tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral 
incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player socratic 
games in both models our first result is an efficient 
algorithm to find nash equilibria in unobservable-query 
socratic games with constant-sum worlds in which the sum 
of the players payoffs is independent of their actions our 
techniques also yield nash equilibria in unobservable-query 
socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds 
strategically zero-sum games generalize constant-sum games by 
allowing the sum of the players payoffs to depend on 
individual players choices of strategy but not on any interaction 
of their choices our second result is an efficient algorithm 
to find nash equilibria in observable-query socratic games 
with constant-sum worlds finally we give an efficient 
algorithm to find correlated equilibria-a weaker but 
increasingly well-studied solution concept for games 
 -in observable-query socratic games with strategically 
zero-sum worlds 
like all games socratic games can be viewed as a 
special case of extensive-form games which represent games 
by trees in which internal nodes represent choices made by 
chance or by the players and the leaves represent outcomes 
that correspond to a vector of payoffs to the players 
algorithmically the generality of extensive-form games makes 
them difficult to solve efficiently and the special cases that 
are known to be efficiently solvable do not include even 
simple socratic games every complete-information classical 
game is a trivial socratic game with a single possible world 
and a single trivial query and efficiently finding nash 
equilibria in classical games has been shown to be hard 
 therefore we would not expect to 
find a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm to 
compute nash equilibria in general socratic games however it 
is well known that nash equilibria can be found efficiently 
via an lp for two-player constant-sum games and 
strategically zero-sum games a socratic game is itself 
a classical game so one might hope that these results can 
be applied to socratic games with constant-sum or 
strategically zero-sum worlds 
we face two major obstacles in extending these 
classical results to socratic games first a socratic game with 
constant-sum worlds is not itself a constant-sum classical 
game-rather the resulting classical game is only 
strategically zero sum worse yet a socratic game with 
strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically 
zero sum-indeed there are no known efficient 
algorithmic techniques to compute nash equilibria in the resulting 
class of classical games exponential-time algorithms like 
lemke howson of course can be used thus even 
when it is easy to find nash equilibria in each of the worlds 
of a socratic game we require new techniques to solve the 
socratic game itself second even when the socratic game 
itself is strategically zero sum the number of possible 
strategies available to each player is exponential in the natural 
representation of the game as a result the standard linear 
programs for computing equilibria have an exponential 
number of variables and an exponential number of constraints 
for unobservable-query socratic games with strategically 
zero-sum worlds we address these obstacles by 
formulating a new lp that uses only polynomially many variables 
 though still an exponential number of constraints and then 
use ellipsoid-based techniques to solve it for 
observablequery socratic games we handle the exponentiality by 
decomposing the game into stages solving the stages 
separately and showing how to reassemble the solutions 
efficiently to solve the stages it is necessary to find nash 
equilibria in bayesian strategically zero-sum games and we 
give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm to do so 
 games and socratic games 
in this section we review background on game theory and 
formally introduce socratic games we present these 
models in the context of two-player games but the multiplayer 
case is a natural extension throughout the paper 
boldface variables will be used to denote a pair of variables e g 
a ai aii let pr x ← π denote the probability that a 
particular value x is drawn from the distribution π and let 
ex∼π g x denote the expectation of g x when x is drawn 
from π 
 background on game theory 
consider two players player i and player ii each of whom 
is attempting to maximize his or her utility or payoff a 
 two-player game is a pair a u where for i ∈ i ii 
 ai is the set of pure strategies for player i and a 
ai aii and 
 ui a → r is the utility function for player i and 
u ui uii 
we require that a and u be common knowledge if each 
player i chooses strategy ai ∈ ai then the payoffs to 
players i and ii are ui a and uii a respectively a game is 
constant sum if for all a ∈ a we have that ui a uii a c 
for some fixed c independent of a 
player i can also play a mixed strategy αi ∈ ai where ai 
denotes the space of probability measures over the set ai 
payoff functions are generalized as ui α ui αi αii 
ea∼α ui a 
p 
a∈a α a ui a where the quantity α a 
 
αi ai · αii aii denotes the joint probability of the 
independent events that each player i chooses action ai from the 
distribution αi this generalization to mixed strategies is 
known as von neumann morgenstern utility in which 
players are indifferent between a guaranteed payoff x and an 
expected payoff of x 
a nash equilibrium is a pair α of mixed strategies so that 
neither player has an incentive to change his or her strategy 
unilaterally formally the strategy pair α is a nash 
equilibrium if and only if both ui αi αii maxαi∈ai ui αi αii 
and uii αi αii maxαii∈aii uii αi αii that is the 
strategies αi and αii are mutual best responses 
a correlated equilibrium is a distribution ψ over a that 
obeys the following if a ∈ a is drawn randomly according 
to ψ and player i learns ai then no player i has incentive to 
deviate unilaterally from playing ai a nash equilibrium is 
a correlated equilibrium in which ψ a αi ai · αii aii is a 
product distribution formally in a correlated equilibrium 
for every a ∈ a we must have that ai is a best response to 
a randomly chosen ˆaii ∈ aii drawn according to ψ ai ˆaii 
and the analogous condition must hold for player ii 
 socratic games 
in this section we formally define socratic games a 
socratic game is a -tuple a w u s q p δ where for 
i ∈ i ii 
 ai is as before the set of pure strategies for player i 
 w is a set of possible worlds one of which is the real 
world wreal 
 ui uw 
i a → r w ∈ w is a set of payoff functions 
for player i one for each possible world 
 s is a set of signals 
 qi is a set of available queries for player i when 
player i makes query qi w → s he or she receives the 
signal qi wreal when player i receives signal qi wreal 
in response to query qi he or she can infer that wreal ∈ 
 w qi w qi wreal i e the set of possible worlds 
from which query qi cannot distinguish wreal 
 p w → is a probability distribution over the 
possible worlds 
 δi qi → r≥ 
gives the query cost for each available 
query for player i 
initially the world wreal is chosen according to the 
probability distribution p but the identity of wreal remains 
unknown to the players that is it is as if the players are 
playing the game a uwreal but do not know wreal the 
players make queries q ∈ q and player i receives the signal 
qi wreal we consider both observable queries and 
unobservable queries when queries are observable each player 
learns which query was made by the other player and the 
results of his or her own query-that is each player i learns 
qi qii and qi wreal for unobservable queries player i learns 
only qi and qi wreal after learning the results of the queries 
the players select strategies a ∈ a and receive as payoffs 
u 
wreal 
i a − δi qi 
in the socratic game a pure strategy for player i consists 
of a query qi ∈ qi and a response function mapping any 
result of the query qi to a strategy ai ∈ ai to play a player s 
state of knowledge after a query is a point in r q × s 
or ri qi × s for observable or unobservable queries 
respectively thus player i s response function maps r or 
ri to ai note that the number of pure strategies is 
exponential as there are exponentially many response 
functions a mixed strategy involves both randomly choosing 
a query qi ∈ qi and randomly choosing an action ai ∈ ai 
in response to the results of the query formally we will 
consider a mixed-strategy-function profile f fquery 
 fresp 
to have two parts 
 a function fquery 
i qi → where fquery 
i qi is the 
probability that player i makes query qi 
 a function fresp 
i that maps r or ri to a 
probability distribution over actions player i chooses an 
action ai ∈ ai according to the probability distribution 
fresp 
i q qi w for observable queries and according to 
fresp 
i qi qi w for unobservable queries with 
unobservable queries for example the probability that 
player i plays action ai conditioned on making query 
qi in world w is given by pr ai ← fresp 
i qi qi w 
mixed strategies are typically defined as probability 
distributions over the pure strategies but here we represent a 
mixed strategy by a pair fquery 
 fresp 
 which is commonly 
referred to as a behavioral strategy in the game-theory 
literature as in any game with perfect recall one can 
easily map a mixture of pure strategies to a behavioral strategy 
f fquery 
 fresp 
that induces the same probability of 
making a particular query qi or playing a particular action after 
making a query qi in a particular world thus it suffices to 
consider only this representation of mixed strategies 
for a strategy-function profile f for observable queries the 
 expected payoff to player i is given by 
x 
q∈q w∈w a∈a 
 
 
 
 
fquery 
i qi · fquery 
ii qii · p w 
· pr ai ← fresp 
i q qi w 
· pr aii ← fresp 
ii q qii w 
· uw 
i a − δi qi 
 
 
 
 
the payoffs for unobservable queries are analogous with 
fresp 
j qj qj w in place of fresp 
j q qj w 
 strategically zero-sum games 
we can view a socratic game g with constant-sum worlds 
as an exponentially large classical game with pure 
strategies make query qi and respond according to fi 
however this classical game is not constant sum the sum of 
the players payoffs varies depending upon their strategies 
because different queries incur different costs however this 
game still has significant structure the sum of payoffs varies 
only because of varying query costs thus the sum of 
payoffs does depend on players choice of strategies but not on 
the interaction of their choices-i e for fixed functions gi 
and gii we have ui q f uii q f gi qi fi gii qii fii 
for all strategies q f such games are called strategically 
zero sum and were introduced by moulin and vial who 
describe a notion of strategic equivalence and define 
strategically zero-sum games as those strategically equivalent to 
zero-sum games it is interesting to note that two socratic 
games with the same queries and strategically equivalent 
worlds are not necessarily strategically equivalent 
a game a u is strategically zero sum if there exist labels 
 i ai for every player i and every pure strategy ai ∈ ai 
 
such that for all mixed-strategy profiles α we have that the 
sum of the utilities satisfies 
ui α uii α 
x 
ai∈ai 
αi ai · i ai 
x 
aii∈aii 
αii aii · ii aii 
note that any constant-sum game is strategically zero sum 
as well 
it is not immediately obvious that one can efficiently 
decide if a given game is strategically zero sum for 
completeness we give a characterization of classical strategically 
zero-sum games in terms of the rank of a simple matrix 
derived from the game s payoffs allowing us to efficiently 
decide if a given game is strategically zero sum and if it is to 
compute the labels i ai 
theorem consider a game g a u with ai

i let mg 
be the ni-by-nii matrix whose i j th 
entry mg 
 i j satisfies log mg 
 i j ui ai 
i aj

then the following are equivalent 
 i g is strategically zero sum 
 ii there exist labels i ai for every player i ∈ i ii and 
every pure strategy ai ∈ ai such that for all pure 
strategies a ∈ a we have ui a uii a i ai 
 ii aii and 
 iii rank mg

strategy is a trivially mixed strategy for ii ⇒ iii let ci be the

 socratic games with 
unobservable queries 
we begin with socratic games with unobservable queries 
where a player s choice of query is not revealed to her 
opponent we give an efficient algorithm to solve 
unobservablequery socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds 
our algorithm is based upon the lp shown in figure 
whose feasible points are nash equilibria for the game the 
lp has polynomially many variables but exponentially many 
constraints we give an efficient separation oracle for the lp 
implying that the ellipsoid method yields an efficient 
algorithm this approach extends the techniques of koller 
and megiddo see also to solve constant-sum games 
represented in extensive form recall that their result does 
not directly apply in our case even a socratic game with 
constant-sum worlds is not a constant-sum classical game 
lemma let g a w u s q p δ be an arbitrary 
unobservable-query socratic game with strategically zero-sum 
worlds any feasible point for the lp in figure can be 
efficiently mapped to a nash equilibrium for g and any nash 
equilibrium for g can be mapped to a feasible point for the 
program 
proof sketch we begin with a description of the 
correspondence between feasible points for the lp and nash 
equilibria for g first suppose that strategy profile f 
fquery 
 fresp 
forms a nash equilibrium for g then the 
following setting for the lp variables is feasible

 we omit the straightforward calculations that verify

 ρi is feasible for the lp 
let f be the strategy-function profile defined as 
fquery 
i qi → yi 
qi 
fresp 
i qi qi w ai → xi 
ai qi w yi 
qi 
 
verifying that this strategy profile is a nash equilibrium 
requires checking that fresp 
i qi qi w is a well-defined 
function from constraint vi that fquery 
i and fresp 
i qi qi w are 
probability distributions from constraints iii and iv and 
that each player is playing a best response to his or her 
opponent s strategy from constraints i and ii finally from 
constraints i and ii the expected payoff to player i is at most 
ρi because the right-hand side of constraint vii is equal 
to the expected sum of the payoffs from f and is at most 
ρi ρii the payoffs are correct and imply the lemma 
we now give an efficient separation oracle for the lp in 
figure thus allowing the ellipsoid method to solve the 
lp in polynomial time recall that a separation oracle is 
a function that given a setting for the variables in the lp 
either returns feasible or returns a particular constraint 
of the lp that is violated by that setting of the variables 
an efficient correct separation oracle allows us to solve the 
lp efficiently via the ellipsoid method 
lemma there exists a separation oracle for the lp 
in figure that is correct and runs in polynomial time 
proof here is a description of the separation oracle sp 
on input xi

 check each of the constraints iii iv v vi 
and vii if any one of these constraints is violated 
then return it 
 define the strategy profile f as follows 
fquery 
i qi → yi 
qi 
fresp 
i qi qi w ai → xi 
ai qi w yi 
qi 
for each query qi we will compute a pure best-response 
function ˆf 
qi 
i for player i to strategy fii after making 
query qi 
more specifically given fii and the result qi wreal of the 
query qi it is straightforward to compute the 
probability that conditioned on the fact that the result of 
query qi is qi w the world is w and player ii will play 
action aii ∈ aii therefore for each query qi and 
response qi w player i can compute the expected utility 
of each pure response ai to the induced mixed strategy 
over aii for player ii player i can then select the ai 
maximizing this expected payoff 
let ˆfi be the response function such that ˆfi qi qi w 
ˆf

figure an lp to find nash equilibria in unobservable-query socratic games with strategically zero-sum 
worlds the input is a socratic game a w u s q p δ so that world w is strategically zero sum with labels

and when the actual world is w ∈ w makes query 
qi and plays action ai with probability xi

 let ˆρ

 for the ˆfi and ˆqi defined in step return constraint 
 i-ˆqi- ˆfi or ii-ˆqii- ˆfii if either is violated if both are 
satisfied then return feasible 
we first note that the separation oracle runs in polynomial 
time and then prove its correctness steps and are clearly 
polynomial for step we have described how to compute 
the relevant response functions by examining every action of 
player i every world every query and every action of player 
ii there are only polynomially many queries worlds query 
results and pure actions so the running time of steps and 
 is thus polynomial 
we now sketch the proof that the separation oracle works 
correctly the main challenge is to show that if any 
constraint i-qi-fi is violated then i-ˆqi- ˆfi is violated in step 
first we observe that by construction the function ˆfi 
computed in step must be a best response to player ii playing 
fii no matter what query player i makes therefore the 
strategy make query ˆqi then play response function ˆfi 
must be a best response to player ii playing fii by definition 
of ˆqi the right-hand side of each constraint i-qi-fi is equal 
to the expected payoff that player i receives when playing 
the pure strategy make query qi and then play response 
function fi against player ii s strategy of fii therefore 
because the pure strategy make query ˆqi and then play 
response function ˆfi is a best response to player ii 
playing fii the right-hand side of constraint i-ˆqi- ˆfi is at least 
as large as the right hand side of any constraint i-ˆqi-fi 
therefore if any constraint i-qi-fi is violated constraint 
 i-ˆqi- ˆfi is also violated an analogous argument holds for 
player ii 
these lemmas and the well-known fact that nash 
equilibria always exist imply the following theorem 
theorem nash equilibria can be found in 
polynomial time for any two-player unobservable-query socratic 
game with strategically zero-sum worlds 
 socratic games with 
observable queries 
in this section we give efficient algorithms to find a 
nash equilibrium for observable-query socratic games with 
constant-sum worlds and a correlated equilibrium in the 
broader class of socratic games with strategically zero-sum 
worlds recall that a socratic game g a w u s q p δ 
with observable queries proceeds in two stages 
stage the players simultaneously choose queries q ∈ q 
player i receives as output qi qii and qi wreal 
stage the players simultaneously choose strategies a ∈ 
a the payoff to player i is u 
wreal 
i a − δi qi 
using backward induction we first solve stage and then 
proceed to the stage- game 
for a query q ∈ q we would like to analyze the stage- 
game ˆgq resulting from the players making queries q in 
stage technically however ˆgq is not actually a game 
because at the beginning of stage the players have different 
information about the world player i knows qi wreal and 
 
player ii knows qii wreal fortunately the situation in which 
players have asymmetric private knowledge has been well 
studied in the game-theory literature a bayesian game is 
a quadruple a t r u where 
 ai is the set of pure strategies for player i 
 ti is the set of types for player i 
 r is a probability distribution over t r t denotes the 
probability that player i has type ti for all i 
 ui a × t → r is the payoff function for player i 
if the players have types t and play pure strategies a 
then ui a t denotes the payoff for player i 
initially a type t is drawn randomly from t according to the 
distribution r player i learns his type ti but does not learn 
any other player s type player i then plays a mixed strategy 
αi ∈ ai-that is a probability distribution over ai-and 
receives payoff ui α t a strategy function is a function 
hi ti → ai player i plays the mixed strategy hi ti ∈ ai 
when her type is ti a strategy-function profile h is a 
bayesian nash equilibrium if and only if no player i has 
unilateral incentive to deviate from hi if the other players play 
according to h for a two-player bayesian game if α h t 
then the profile h is a bayesian nash equilibrium exactly 
when the following condition and its analogue for player ii 
hold et∼r ui α t maxhi 
et∼r ui hi ti αii t these 
conditions hold if and only if for all ti ∈ ti occurring with 
positive probability player i s expected utility conditioned 
on his type being ti is maximized by hi ti a bayesian 
game is constant sum if for all a ∈ a and all t ∈ t we 
have ui a t uii a t ct for some constant ct 
independent of a a bayesian game is strategically zero sum if the 
classical game a u · t is strategically zero sum for every 
t ∈ t whether a bayesian game is strategically zero sum 
can be determined as in theorem for further 
discussion of bayesian games see 
we now formally define the stage- game as a bayesian 
game given a socratic game g a w u s q p δ and 
a query profile q ∈ q we define the stage- bayesian game 
gstage q a tq 
 pstage q

we now find equilibria in the stage games for socratic games 
with constant- or strategically zero-sum worlds we first 
show that the stage games are well structured in this setting 
lemma consider an observable-query socratic game 
g a w u s q p δ with constant-sum worlds then 
the stage- game galg 
stage is strategically zero sum for every 
algorithm alg and every stage- game gstage q is bayesian 
constant sum if the worlds of g are strategically zero sum 
then every gstage q is bayesian strategically zero sum 
we now show that we can efficiently compute equilibria for 
these well-structured stage games 
theorem there exists a polynomial-time algorithm 
bne finding bayesian nash equilibria in strategically 
zerosum bayesian and thus classical strategically zero-sum or 
bayesian constant-sum two-player games 
proof sketch let g a t r u be a strategically 
zero-sum bayesian game define an unobservable-query 
socratic game g 
with one possible world for each t ∈ t one 
available zero-cost query qi for each player i so that qi 
reveals ti and all else as in g bayesian nash equilibria in g 
correspond directly to nash equilibria in g 
 and the worlds 
of g 
are strategically zero sum thus by theorem we 
can compute nash equilibria for g 
 and thus we can 
compute bayesian nash equilibria for g 
 lp s for zero-sum two-player bayesian games have been 
previously developed and studied 
theorem we can compute a nash equilibrium for 
an arbitrary two-player observable-query socratic game g 
a w u s q p δ with constant-sum worlds in polynomial 
time 
proof because each world of g is constant sum lemma 
 implies that the induced stage- games gstage q are 
all bayesian constant sum thus we can use algorithm 
bne to compute a bayesian nash equilibrium hq bne 
 
bne gstage q for each q ∈ q by theorem 
furthermore again by lemma the induced stage- game 
gbne 
stage is classical strategically zero sum therefore we can 
again use algorithm bne to compute a nash equilibrium 
α bne gbne 
stage again by theorem therefore by 
lemma we can assemble α and the hq bne 
 s into a nash 
equilibrium for the socratic game g 
 
we would like to extend our results on observable-query 
socratic games to socratic games with strategically 
zerosum worlds while we can still find nash equilibria in the 
stage- games the resulting stage- game is not in 
general strategically zero sum thus finding nash equilibria 
in observable-query socratic games with strategically 
zerosum worlds seems to require substantially new techniques 
however our techniques for decomposing observable-query 
socratic games do allow us to find correlated equilibria in 
this case 
lemma consider an observable-query socratic game 
g a w u s q p δ let alg be an arbitrary algorithm 
that finds a bayesian nash equilibrium in each of the derived 
stage- games gstage q and let galg 
stage be the derived 
stage game let φ be a correlated equilibrium for galg 
stage and let 
hq alg 
 alg gstage q be a bayesian nash equilibrium for 
each gstage q then the following distribution over pure 
strategies is a correlated equilibrium for g 
ψ q f φ q 
y 
i∈ i ii

thus to find a correlated equilibrium in an observable-query 
socratic game with strategically zero-sum worlds we need 
only algorithm bne from theorem along with an 
efficient algorithm for finding a correlated equilibrium in a 
general game such an algorithm exists the definition of 
correlated equilibria can be directly translated into an lp 
and therefore we have the following theorem 
theorem we can provide both efficient oracle 
access and efficient sampling access to a correlated 
equilibrium for any observable-query two-player socratic game with 
strategically zero-sum worlds 
because the support of the correlated equilibrium may be 
exponentially large providing oracle and sampling access is 
the natural way to represent the correlated equilibrium 
by lemma we can also compute correlated equilibria 
in any observable-query socratic game for which nash 
equilibria are computable in the induced gstage q games e g 
when gstage q is of constant size 
another potentially interesting model of queries in 
socratic games is what one might call public queries in which 
both the choice and outcome of a player s query is 
observable by all players in the game this model might be most 
appropriate in the presence of corporate espionage or media 
leaks or in a setting in which the queries-and thus their 
results-are done in plain view the techniques that we 
have developed in this section also yield exactly the same 
results as for observable queries the proof is actually 
simpler with public queries the players payoffs are common 
knowledge when stage begins and thus stage really is a 
complete-information game there may still be uncertainty 
about the real world but all players use the observed 
signals to infer exactly the same set of possible worlds in which 
wreal may lie thus they are playing a complete-information 
game against each other thus we have the same results 
as in theorems and more simply by solving stage 
using a non-bayesian nash-equilibrium finder and solving 
stage as before 
our results for observable queries are weaker than for 
unobservable in socratic games with worlds that are 
strategically zero sum but not constant sum we find only a 
correlated equilibrium in the observable case whereas we find a 
nash equilibrium in the unobservable case we might hope 
to extend our unobservable-query techniques to observable 
queries but there is no obvious way to do so the 
fundamental obstacle is that the lp s payoff constraint becomes 
nonlinear if there is any dependence on the probability that 
the other player made a particular query this dependence 
arises with observable queries suggesting that observable 
socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds may be 
harder to solve 
 related work 
our work was initially motivated by research in the social 
sciences indicating that real people seem irrationally 
paralyzed when they are presented with additional options in 
this section we briefly review some of these social-science 
experiments and then discuss technical approaches related 
to socratic game theory 
prima facie a rational agent s happiness given an added 
option can only increase however recent research has found 
that more choices tend to decrease happiness for 
example students choosing among extra-credit options are more 
likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices 
and moreover produce higher-quality work see also 
 the psychology literature explores a number of 
explanations people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by 
comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of 
all other options instead of the single best alternative 
a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the 
other options and so on the present work explores 
an economic explanation of this phenomenon information 
is not free when there are more options a decision-maker 
must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome 
see e g the work of skyrms for a philosophical 
perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations 
finally we note the connection between socratic games and 
modal logic a formalism for the logic of possibility and 
necessity 
the observation that human players typically do not play 
rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model 
partially rational players the typical model of this 
socalled bounded rationality is to postulate bounds 
on computational power in computing the consequences of 
a strategy the work on bounded rationality 
differs from the models that we consider here in that instead 
of putting hard limitations on the computational power of 
the agents we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of 
the state of the world requiring them to spend time and 
therefore money utility to learn about it 
partially observable stochastic games posgs are a 
general framework used in ai to model situations of multi-agent 
planning in an evolving unknown environment but the 
generality of posgs seems to make them very difficult 
recent work has been done in developing algorithms for 
restricted classes of posgs most notably classes of 
cooperative posgs-e g -which are very different from 
the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in 
this paper 
the fundamental question in socratic games is deciding 
on the comparative value of making a more costly but more 
informative query or concluding the data-gathering phase 
and picking the best option given current information this 
tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts 
a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 
 
from delay-prone information sources doing approximate 
reasoning in intelligent systems deciding when to take 
the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a 
beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference 
 among many others 
this issue can also be viewed as another perspective on 
the general question of exploration versus exploitation that 
arises often in ai when is it better to actively seek 
additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one 
already has see e g most of this work differs 
significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent 
planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting a 
notable exception is the work of larson and sandholm 
 on mechanism design for interacting agents whose 
computation is costly and limited they present a model 
in which players must solve a computationally intractable 
valuation problem using costly computation to learn some 
hidden parameters and results for auctions and bargaining 
games in this model 
 future directions 
efficiently finding nash equilibria in socratic games with 
non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult 
because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games 
has been shown to be unlikely 
 there has however been some algorithmic success in 
finding nash equilibria in restricted classical settings e g 
 we might hope to extend our results to 
analogous socratic games 
an efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in 
general socratic games seems more attainable suppose the 
players receive recommended queries and responses the 
difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from 
his recommended query he already knows his recommended 
response in each of the stage- games in a correlated 
equilibrium a player s expected payoff generally depends on his 
recommended strategy and thus a player may deviate in 
stage so as to land in a stage- game where he has been 
given a better than average recommended response 
 socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type 
so papadimitriou s results do not imply correlated 
equilibria for them 
socratic games can be extended to allow players to make 
adaptive queries choosing subsequent queries based on 
previous results our techniques carry over to o rounds of 
unobservable queries but it would be interesting to 
compute equilibria in socratic games with adaptive observable 
queries or with ω rounds of unobservable queries 
special cases of adaptive socratic games are closely related to 
single-agent problems like minimum latency 
determining strategies for using priced information 
and an online version of minimum test cover 
although there are important technical distinctions between 
adaptive socratic games and these problems approximation 
techniques from this literature may apply to socratic games 
the question of approximation raises interesting questions 
even in non-adaptive socratic games an -approximate 
nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player 
can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α 
finding approximate nash equilibria in both adaptive and 
non-adaptive socratic games is an interesting direction to 
pursue 
another natural extension is the model where query 
results are stochastic in this paper we model a query as 
deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into 
subsets that the query cannot distinguish however one could 
instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set 
of possible worlds into the set of signals with this 
modification our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent 
to the model of bergemann and v¨alim¨aki in which 
the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the 
worlds our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in 
such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is 
represented as a table that for each world signal pair lists 
the probability that the query outputs that signal in that 
world it is also interesting to consider settings in which the 
game s queries are specified by a compact representation of 
the relevant probability distributions for example one 
might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a 
sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by 
bergemann and v¨alim¨aki efficiently finding equilibria in 
such settings remains an open problem 
another interesting setting for socratic games is when the 
set q of available queries is given by q p γ -i e each 
player chooses to make a set q ∈ p γ of queries from a 
specified groundset γ of queries here we take the query 
cost to be a linear function so that δ q 
p 
γ∈q δ γ 
natural groundsets include comparison queries if my 
opponent is playing strategy aii would i prefer to play ai or 
ˆai strategy queries what is my vector of payoffs if i 
play strategy ai and world-identity queries is the world 
w ∈ w the real world when one can infer a polynomial 
bound on the number of queries made by a rational player 
then our results yield efficient solutions for example we 
can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element 
γ ∈ γ has δ γ ω m − m where m and m denote 
the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any 
world conversely it is np-hard to compute a nash 
equilibrium for such a game when every δ γ ≤ w 
 even 
when the worlds are constant sum and player ii has only 
a single available strategy thus even computing a best 
response for player i is hard this proof proceeds by 
reduction from set cover intuitively for sufficiently low query 
costs player i must fully identify the actual world through 
his queries selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries 
is hard computing player i s best response can be viewed 
as maximizing a submodular function and thus a best 
response can be − e ≈ approximated greedily 
an interesting open question is whether this approximate 
best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an 
approximate nash equilibrium
