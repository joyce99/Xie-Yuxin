abstract 
in this paper we present a new protocol to address 
multilateral multi-issue negotiation in a cooperative context we 
consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by 
modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria 
decision aid tool also enabling us to extract relevant 
information on a proposal assessment this information is 
used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for 
a consensus between the cooperative agents in addition 
the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management 
context where the common objective of our agents is also 
considered in the preferences of a mediator agent

 introduction 
multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important 
field of study since negotiation problems in the real world 
are often complex ones involving multiple issues to date 
most of previous work in this area dealt 
almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving 
independent issues however real-world negotiation problems 
involve complex dependencies between multiple issues when 
one wants to buy a car for example the value of a given 
car is highly dependent on its price consumption comfort 
and so on the addition of such interdependencies greatly 
complicates the agents utility functions and classical 
utility functions such as the weighted sum are not sufficient 
to model this kind of preferences in the 
authors consider inter-dependencies between issues most 
often defined with boolean values except for while we can 
deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks 
to the modelling power of the choquet integral in 
the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are 
interested in a multilateral negotiation setting klein et al 
 present an approach similar to ours using a mediator 
too and information about the strength of the approval or 
rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation in 
our protocol we use more precise information to improve 
the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and 
tools used to model the preferences of our agents lin in 
 also presents a mediation service but using an 
evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained 
in players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly 
interact with each other until the stable state is reached 
as the population size increases the time it takes for the 
population to stabilize also increases resulting in excessive 
computation communication and time overheads that can 
become prohibitive and for one-to-many and many-to-many 
negotiations the overheads become higher as the number of 
players increases in the authors consider a non-linear 
utility function by using constraints on the domain of the 
issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids 
maximizing the social welfare our preference model a 
nonlinear utility function too is more complex than one since 
the choquet integral takes into account the interactions and 
the importance of each decision criteria issue not only the 
dependencies between the values of the issues to determine 
the utility we also use an iterative protocol enabling us to 
find a solution even when no bid combination is possible 
in this paper we propose a negotiation protocol suited for 
multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into 
account at the same time multiple interdependent issues and 
recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal 
moreover the preferences of our agents are modelled using 
a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take 
into account information about the improvements that can 
be made to a proposal in order to help in accelerating the 
search for a consensus between the agents therefore we 
propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our 
decision problem using a mas with a multi-criteria decision 
aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based 
multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol this protocol 
is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
that it has subgame perfect equilibria provided that agents 
behave rationally in the sense of von neumann and 
morgenstern the approach proposed in this paper has been first 
introduced and presented in in this paper we present 
our first experiments with some noteworthy results and a 
more complex multi-agent system with representatives to 
enable us to have a more robust system 
in section we present our application a crisis 
management problem section deals with the general aspect of the 
proposed approach the preference modelling is described 
in sect whereas the motivations of our protocol are 
considered in sect and the agent multiagent modelling in 
sect section presents the formal modelling and 
properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments 
in sect finally in section we conclude and present 
the future work 
 case study 
this protocol is applied to a crisis management problem 
crisis management is a relatively new field of management 
and is composed of three types of activities crisis 
prevention operational preparedness and management of declared 
crisis the crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis 
to an acceptable level and when possible avoid that the 
crisis actually happens the operational preparedness includes 
strategic advanced planning training and simulation to 
ensure availability rapid mobilisation and deployment of 
resources to deal with possible emergencies the management 
of declared crisis is the response to - including the 
evacuation search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by 
minimising the effects of the crises limiting the impact on 
the community and environment and on a longer term by 
bringing the community s systems back to normal in this 
paper we focus on the response part of the management of 
declared crisis activity and particularly on the evacuation 
of the injured people in disaster situations when a crisis 
is declared the plans defined during the operational 
preparedness activity are executed for disasters master plans 
are executed these plans are elaborated by the authorities 
with the collaboration of civil protection agencies police 
health services non-governmental organizations etc 
when a victim is found several actions follow first a 
rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is 
given first aid on the spot then the victims can be placed 
in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical 
advanced post for all victims a sorter physician - 
generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their 
injuries and classifies the victims by pathology the 
evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take 
place after these clinical examinations and classifications 
nowadays to evacuate the injured people the physicians 
contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical 
assessments of the most urgent cases the emergency call 
centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in 
the hospitals to care for these victims the physicians are 
informed of the allocations so they can proceed to the 
evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according 
to the pathologies and the transport modes provided in 
this context we can observe that the evacuation is based 
on three important elements the examination and 
classification of the victims the search for an allocation and the 
transport in the case of the march madrid attacks 
for instance some injured people did not receive the 
appropriate health care because during the search for space the 
emergency call centre did not consider the transport 
constraints and in particular the traffic therefore for a large 
scale crisis management problem there is a need to support 
the emergency call centre and the physicians in the 
dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport 
constraints and availabilities 
 proposed approach 
to accept a proposal an agent has to consider several 
issues such as in the case of the crisis management problem 
the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit 
medical and surgical staffs theatres and so on therefore each 
agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource 
constraints and other decision criteria such as for the case 
study the level of congestion of a hospital all the agents 
also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies 
between these decision criteria 
the first hypothesis of our approach is that there are 
several parties involved in and impacted by the decision and 
so they have to decide together according to their own 
constraints and decision criteria negotiation is the process by 
which a group facing a conflict communicates with one 
another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement 
or decision and so the agents have to negotiate the 
conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for 
all the parties by using a particular protocol in our 
context multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type 
that is the best suited for this type of problem this type 
of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to 
negotiate together the negotiation also deals with multiple 
issues moreover an other hypothesis is that we are in a 
cooperative context where all the parties have a common 
objective which is to provide the best possible solution for 
everyone this implies the use of a negotiation protocol 
encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its 
preferences 
taking into account these aspects a multi-agent system 
 mas seems to be a reliable method in the case of a 
distributed decision making process indeed a mas is a suitable 
answer when the solution has to combine at least 
distribution features and reasoning capabilities another motivation 
for using mas lies in the fact that mas is well known for 
facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision 
making level in various applications 
therefore our approach consists of solving a multiparty 
decision problem using a mas with 
 the preferences of the agents are modelled using a 
multi-criteria decision aid tool myriad also 
enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating 
proposals on several criteria 
 a cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue 
negotiation protocol 
 the preference model 
we consider a problem where an agent has several decision 
criteria a set nk nk of criteria for each agent k 
involved in the negotiation protocol these decision criteria 
enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are 
negotiated the issues correspond directly or not to the decision 
criteria however for the example of the crisis management 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
problem the issues are the set of victims to dispatch 
between the hospitals these issues are translated to decision 
criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and 
so to an updated number of available beds medical teams 
and so on in order to take into account the complexity that 
exists between the criteria issues we use a multi-criteria 
decision aiding mcda tool named myriad developed 
at thales for mcda applications based on a two-additive 
choquet integral which is a good compromise between 
versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions 
between decision criteria 
the set of the attributes of nk is denoted by xk 
 xk 
nk 
 
all the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the 
introduction of partial utility functions uk 
i xk 
i → the 
 scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding 
the values of the attributes an option x is identified to an 
element of xk 
 xk 
 × · · · × xk 
nk 
 with x x xnk 
then the overall assessment of x is given by 
uk x hk uk 
 x uh 
nk 
 xnk 
where hk nk → is the aggregation function the 
overall preference relation over xk 
is then 
x y ⇐⇒ uk x ≥ uk y 
the two-additive choquet integral is defined for 
 z znk ∈ nk by 
hk z znk 
x 
i∈nk 
 
 vk 
i − 
 
 
x 
j i 
 ik 
i j 
 
a zi 
 
x 
ik 
i j 
ik 
i j zi ∧ zj 
x 
ii j 
 ii j zi ∨ zj 
where vk 
i is the relative importance of criterion i for agent 
k and ik 
i j is the interaction between criteria i and j ∧ and 
∨ denote the min and max functions respectively assume 
that zi zj a positive interaction between criteria i and 
j depicts complementarity between these criteria positive 
synergy hence the lower score of z on criterion i 
conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to 
a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of 
the relative importance of the criteria taken independently 
of the other ones in other words the score of z on criterion 
j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i conversely a 
negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts 
substitutability between these criteria negative synergy the 
score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on 
criterion j 
in myriad we can also obtain some recommendations 
corresponding to an indicator ωc h x measuring the worth 
to improve option x w r t hk on some criteria c ⊆ nk as 
follows 
ωc hk x 
z 
 
hk 
 
 − τ xc τ xnk\c 
´ 
− hk x 
ec τ x 
dτ 
where −τ xc τ xnk\c is the compound act that equals 
 − τ xi τ if i ∈ c and equals xi if i ∈ nk \ c moreover 
ec τ x is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile 
 − τ xc τ xnk\c function ωc hk x depicts the 
average improvement of hk when the criteria of coalition a 
range from xc to c divided by the average effort needed 
for this improvement we generally assume that ec is of 
order that is ec τ x τ 
p 
i∈c − xi the expression 
of ωc hk x when hk is a choquet integral is given in 
the agent is then recommended to improve of coalition c 
for which ωc hk x is maximum this recommendation is 
very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents 
to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while 
not revealing their own preference model 
 protocol motivations 
for multi-issue problems there are two approaches a 
complete package approach where the issues are 
negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach 
where the issues are negotiated one by one when the issues 
are dependant then it is the best choice to bargain 
simultaneously over all issues thus the complete package is 
the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the 
overall set of injured people while taking into account the other 
decision criteria 
we have to consider that all the parties of the 
negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all 
involved in and impacted by this decision and so an 
unanimous agreement is required in the protocol in addition no 
party can leave the process until an agreement is reached 
i e a consensus achieved this makes sense since a proposal 
concerns all the parties moreover we have to guarantee the 
availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure 
that a proposal is realistic to this end the information 
about these availabilities are used to determine admissible 
proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the 
parties has not enough resources to execute achieve it at the 
beginning of the negotiation each party provides its 
maximum availabilities this defining the constraints that have 
to be satisfied for each offer submitted 
the negotiation has also to converge quickly on an 
unanimous agreement we decided to introduce in the negotiation 
protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the 
passed negotiation time this incentive is defined on the 
basis of a time dependent penalty the discounting factor as 
in or a time-dependent threshold this penalty has to 
be used in the accept reject stage of our consensus 
procedure in fact in the case of a discounting factor each party 
will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal 
using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor 
in the case of a time-dependent threshold if the evaluation 
is greater or equal to this threshold the offer is accepted 
otherwise in the next period its threshold is reduced 
the use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does 
not help in finding a solution some information about the 
assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are 
needed in particular it would be helpful to know why an 
offer has been rejected and or what can be done to make 
a proposal that would be accepted myriad provides an 
analysis that determines the flaws an option here a 
proposal in particular it gives this type of information which 
criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the 
highest possible overall evaluation as we use this tool 
to model the parties involved in the negotiation the 
information about the criteria to improve can be used by the 
mediator to elaborate the proposals we also consider that 
the dual function can be used to take into account another 
type of information on which criteria of a proposal no 
improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a 
proposal is still acceptable do not decrease thus all 
information is a constraint to be satisfied as much as possible by 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
figure an illustration of some system 
the parties to make a new proposal 
we are in a cooperative context and revealing one s 
opinion on what can be improved is not prohibited on the 
contrary it is useful and recommended here seeing that it helps 
in converging on an agreement therefore when one of the 
parties refuses an offer some information will be 
communicated in order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation 
we introduce a mediator this specific entity is in charge 
of making the proposals to the other parties in the system 
by taking into account their public constraints e g their 
availabilities and the recommendations they make this 
mediator can also be considered as the representative of 
the general interest we can have in some applications such 
as in the crisis management problem the physician will be 
the mediator and will also have some more information to 
consider when making an offer e g traffic state transport 
mode and time each party in a negotiation n a 
negotiator can also be a mediator of another negotiation n this 
party becoming the representative of n in the negotiation 
n as illustrated by fig what can also help in reducing 
the communication time 
 agentification 
how the problem is transposed in a mas problem is a 
very important aspect when designing such a system the 
agentification has an influence upon the systems efficiency in 
solving the problem therefore in this section we describe 
the elements and constraints taken into account during the 
modelling phase and for the model itself however for this 
negotiation application the modelling is quite natural when 
one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main 
properties 
first of all it seems obvious that there should be one agent 
for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation 
protocol the agents have the involved parties information 
and preferences these agents are 
 autonomous they decide for themselves what when 
and under what conditions actions should be 
performed 
 rational they have a means-ends competence to fit 
its decisions according to its knowledge preferences 
and goal 
 self-interested they have their own interests which 
may conflict with the interests of other agents 
moreover their preferences are modelled and a proposal 
evaluated and analysed using myriad each agent has 
private information and can access public information as 
knowledge 
in fact there are two types of agents the mediator type 
for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our 
negotiation protocol the delegated physician in our application 
and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to 
the other parties the hospitals the main behaviours that 
an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol 
are the following 
 convert improvements converts the information 
given by the other agents involved in the negotiation 
about the improvements to be done into constraints 
on the next proposal to be made 
 convert no decrease converts the information given 
by the other agents involved in the negotiation about 
the points that should not be changed into constraints 
on the next proposal to be made 
 construct proposal constructs a new proposal 
according to the constraints obtained with 
convert improvements convert no decrease and the agent 
preferences 
the main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator 
needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following 
 convert proposal converts a proposal to a myriad 
option of the agent according to its preferences model 
and its private data 
 convert improvements wc converts the agent 
recommendations for the improvements of a myriad 
option into general information on the proposal 
 convert no decrease wc converts the agent 
recommendations about the criteria that should not be 
changed in the myriad option into general information 
on the proposal 
in addition to these behaviours there are for the two types 
of agents access behaviours to myriad functionalities 
such as the evaluation and improvement functions 
 evaluate option evaluates the myriad option 
obtained using the agent behaviour convert proposal 
 improvements gets the agent recommendations to 
improve a proposal from the myriad option 
 no decrease gets the agent recommendations to not 
change some criteria from the myriad option 
of course before running the system with such agents we 
must have defined each party preferences model in 
myriad this model has to be part of the agent so that it could 
be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the 
improvements in addition to these behaviours the communication 
acts between the agents is as follows 
 mediator agent communication acts

propose 
propose 
figure the protocol diagram in auml and 
where m is the number of negotiator agents and l 
is the number of agents refusing current proposal 
 a propose sends a message containing a proposal 
to all negotiator agents 
 b inform sends a message to all negotiator agents 
to inform them that an agreement has been 
reached and containing the consensus outcome 
 negotiator agent communication acts 
 a accept-proposal sends a message to the 
mediator agent containing the agent recommendations 
to improve the proposal and obtained with 
convert improvements wc 
 b reject-proposal sends a message to the 
mediator agent containing the agent recommendations 
about the criteria that should not be changed and 
obtained with convert no decrease wc 
such agents are interchangeable in a case of failure since 
they all have the same properties and represent a user with 
his preference model not depending on the agent but on the 
model defined in myriad when the issues and the 
decision criteria are different from each other the information 
about the criteria improvement have to be pre-processed to 
give some instructions on the directions to take and about 
the negotiated issues it is the same for the evaluation of a 
proposal each agent has to convert the information about 
the issues to update its private information and to obtain 
the values of each attribute of the decision criteria 
 our protocol 
formally we consider negotiations where a set of 
players a m and a player a are negotiating over 
a set q of size q the player a is the protocol 
mediator the mediator agent of the agentification the 
utility preference function of a player k ∈ a ∪ a is uk 
defined using myriad as presented in section with a set 
nk of criteria xk 
an option and so on an offer is a 
vector p p p · · · pm a partition of q in which pk is 
player k s share of q we have p ∈ p where p is the set of 
admissible proposals a finite set note that p is determined 
using all players general constraints on the proposals and q 
moreover let ˜p denote a particular proposal defined as a s 
preferred proposal 
we also have the following notation δk is the 
threshold decrease factor of player k φk pk → xk 
is player 
k s function to convert a proposal to an option and ψk is 
the function indicating which points p has to be improved 
with ψk its dual function - on which points no 
improvement is necessary ψk is obtained using the dual function of 
ωc hk x 
eωc hk x 
z 
 
hk x − hk 
 
τ xc xnk\c 
´ 
eec τ x 
dτ 
where eec τ x is the cost effort to go from τxc xnk\c 
to x 
in period t of our consensus procedure player a proposes 
an agreement p all players k ∈ a respond to a by 
accepting or rejecting p the responses are made simultaneously 
if all players k ∈ a accept the offer the game ends if any 
player k rejects p then the next period t begins player a 
makes another proposal p by taking into account 
information provided by the players and the ones that have rejected 
p apply a penalty therefore our negotiation protocol can 
be as follows 
protocol p 
 at the beginning we set period t 
 a makes a proposal p ∈ p that has not been 
proposed before 
 wait that all players of a give their opinion 
yes or no to the player a if all players 
agree on p this later is chosen otherwise 
t is incremented and we go back to previous 
point 
 if there is no more offer left from p the 
default offer ˜p will be chosen 
 the utility of players regarding a given 
offer decreases over time more precisely the 
utility of player k ∈ a at period t regarding 
offer p is uk φk pk t ft uk φk pk 
where one can take for instance ft x 
x δk t 
or ft x x − δk t as penalty 
function 
lemma protocol p has at least one subgame perfect 
equilibrium 
 
proof protocol p is first transformed in a game in 
extensive form to this end one shall specify the order in which 
the responders a react to the offer p of a however the 
order in which the players answer has no influence on the 
course of the game and in particular on their personal 
utility hence protocol p is strictly equivalent to a game in 
 
a subgame perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium such that 
players strategies constitute a nash equilibrium in every 
subgame of the original game a nash equilibrium 
is a set of strategies one for each player such that no player 
has incentive to unilaterally change his her action 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
extensive form considering any order of the players a this 
game is clearly finite since p is finite and each offer can 
only be proposed once finally p corresponds to a game 
with perfect information we end the proof by using a 
classical result stating that any finite game in extensive form 
with perfect information has at least one subgame perfect 
equilibrium see e g 
rational players in the sense of von neumann and 
morgenstern involved in protocol p will necessarily come up 
with a subgame perfect equilibrium 
example consider an example with a and 
p p 
 p 
 p 
 where the default offer is p 
 assume 
that ft x x − t consider the following table giving 
the utilities at t 
p 
p 
p 
a 
 
 
it is easy to see that there is one single subgame perfect 
equilibrium for protocol p corresponding to these values this 
equilibrium consists of the following choices first a proposes 
p 
 player rejects this offer a proposes then p 
and both 
players and accepts otherwise they are threatened to 
receive the worse offer p 
for them finally offer p 
is 
chosen option p 
is the best one for a but the two other players 
vetoed it it is interesting to point out that even though a 
prefers p 
to p 
 offer p 
is first proposed and this make 
p 
being accepted if a proposes p 
first then the subgame 
perfect equilibrium in this situation is p 
 to sum up the 
worse preferred options have to be proposed first in order to 
get finally the best one but this entails a waste of time 
analysing the previous example one sees that the game 
outcome at the equilibrium is p 
that is not very attractive 
for player option p 
seems more balanced since no player 
judges it badly it could be seen as a better solution as a 
consensus among the agents 
in order to introduce this notion of balanceness in the 
protocol we introduce a condition under which a player will 
be obliged to accept the proposal reducing the autonomy 
of the agents but for increasing rationality and cooperation 
more precisely if the utility of a player is larger than a given 
threshold then acceptance is required the threshold 
decreases over time so that players have to make more and 
more concession therefore the protocol becomes as 
follows 
protocol p 
 at the beginning we set period t 
 a makes a proposal p ∈ p that has not been 
proposed before 
 wait that all players of a give their opinion 
yes or no to the player a a player k must 
accept the offer if uk φk pk ≥ ρk t where 
ρk t tends to zero when t grows 
moreover there exists t such that for all t ≥ t 
ρk t if all players agree on p this 
later is chosen otherwise t is incremented 
and we go back to previous point 
 if there is no more offer left from p the 
default offer ˜p will be chosen 
one can show exactly as in lemma that protocol p 
has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium we expect 
that protocol p provides a solution not to far from p 
so it favours fairness among the players therefore our 
cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue protocol is the 
following 
protocol p 
 at the beginning we set period t 
 a makes a proposal p ∈ p that has not 
been proposed before considering ψk pt 
 
and ψk pt 
 for all players k ∈ a 
 wait that all players of a give their opinion 
 yes ψk pt 
 or no ψk pt 
 to the 
player a a player k must accept the offer 
if uk φk pk ≥ ρk t where ρk t tends to 
zero when t grows moreover there exists 
t such that for all t ≥ t ρk t if 
all players agree on p this later is chosen 
otherwise t is incremented and we go back 
to previous point 
 if there is no more offer left from p the 
default offer ˜p will be chosen 
 experiments 
we developed a mas using the widely used jade agent 
platform this mas is designed to be as general as 
possible e g a general framework to specialise according to the 
application and enable us to make some preliminary 
experiments the experiments aim at verifying that our approach 
gives solutions as close as possible to the maximin solution 
and in a small number of rounds and hopefully in a short 
time since our context is highly cooperative we defined 
the two types of agents and their behaviours as introduced 
in section the agents and their behaviours correspond 
to the main classes of our prototype negotiatoragent 
and negotiatorbehaviour for the negotiator agents and 
mediatoragent and mediatorbehaviour for the mediator 
agent these classes extend jade classes and integrate 
myriad into the agents reducing the amount of 
communications in the system some functionalities depending on 
the application have to be implemented according to the 
application by extending these classes in particular all 
conversion parts of the agents have to be specified according to 
the application since to convert a proposal into decision 
criteria we need to know first this model and the correlations 
between the proposals and this model 
first to illustrate our protocol we present a simple 
example of our dispatch problem in this example we have 
three hospitals h h and h each hospital can receive 
victims having a particular pathology in such a way that 
h can receive patients with the pathology burn surgery 
or orthopedic h can receive patients with the pathology 
surgery orthopedic or cardiology and h can receive 
patients with the pathology burn or cardiology all the 
hospitals have similar decision criteria reflecting their preferences 
on the level of congestion they can face for the overall 
hospital and the different services available as briefly explained 
for hospital h hereafter 
for hospital h the preference model fig is composed 
of five criteria these criteria correspond to the preferences 
on the pathologies the hospital can treat in the case of 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
figure the h preference model in myriad 
the pathology burn the corresponding criterion also named 
burn as shown in fig represents the preferences of h 
according to the value of cburn which is the current capacity 
of burn therefore the utility function of this criterion 
represents a preference such that the more there are patients of 
this pathology in the hospital the less the hospital may 
satisfy them and this with an initial capacity in addition to 
reflecting this kind of viewpoint the aggregation function as 
defined in myriad introduces a veto on the criteria burn 
surgery orthopedic and ereceipt where ereceipt is the 
criterion for the preferences about the capacity to receive a 
number of patients at the same time 
in this simplified example the physician have no 
particular preferences on the dispatch and the mediator agent 
chooses a proposal randomly in a subset of the set of 
admissibility this subset have to satisfy as much as possible the 
recommendations made by the hospitals to solve this 
problem for this example we decided to solve a linear problem 
with the availability constraints and the recommendations 
as linear constraints on the dispatch values the set of 
admissibility is then obtained by solving this linear problem 
by the use of prolog moreover only the recommendations 
on how to improve a proposal are taken into account the 
problem to solve is then to dispatch to hospital h h and 
h the set of victims composed of victims with the 
pathology burn with surgery with orthopedic and with 
cardiology the availabilities of the hospitals are as 
presented in the following table 
available overall burn surg orthop cardio 
h 
 h - 
h - - 
we obtain a multiagent system with the mediator agent 
and three agents of type negotiator for the three hospital 
in the problem the hospitals threshold are fixed 
approximatively to the level where an evaluation is considered as 
good to start the negotiator agents send their 
availabilities the mediator agent makes a proposal chosen randomly 
in admissible set obtained with these availabilities as 
linear constraints this proposal is the vector p h burn 
 h surgery h orthopaedic h surgery 
 h orthopaedic h cardiology h burn h 
cardiology and the mediator sends propose p to h 
h and h for approval each negotiator agent evaluates 
this proposal and answers back by accepting or rejecting p 
 agent h rejects this offer since its evaluation is very 
far from the threshold a bad score and gives 
a recommendation to improve burn and surgery by 
sending the message 
reject proposal burn surgery 
 agent h accepts this offer by sending the message 
accept proposal the proposal evaluation being 
good 
 agent h accepts p by sending the message accept 
proposal the proposal evaluation being good 
just with the recommendations provided by agent h the 
mediator is able to make a new proposal by restricting the 
value of burn and surgery the new proposal obtained is 
then p h burn h surgery h orthopaedic 
 h surgery h orthopaedic h cardiology 
 h burn h cardiology the mediator sends 
propose p the negotiator agents h h and h answer 
back by sending the message accept proposal p being 
evaluated with a high enough score to be acceptable and 
also considered as a good proposal when using the 
explanation function of myriad an agreement is reached with 
p note that the evaluation of p by h has decreased in 
comparison with p but not enough to be rejected and that 
this solution is the pareto one p 
 
other examples have been tested with the same settings 
issues in in three negotiator agents and the same mediator 
agent with no preference model but selecting randomly the 
proposal we obtained solutions either equal or close to the 
maximin solution the distance from the standard deviation 
being less than the evaluations not far from the ones 
obtained with p 
and with less than seven proposals made 
this shows us that we are able to solve this multi-issue 
multilateral negotiation problem in a simple and efficient way 
with solutions close to the pareto solution 
 conclusion and future work 
this paper presents a new protocol to address 
multilateral multi-issue negotiation in a cooperative context the 
first main contribution is that we take into account complex 
inter-dependencies between multiple issues with the use of 
a complex preference modelling this contribution is 
reinforced by the use of multi-issue negotiation in a multilateral 
context our second contribution is the use of sharp 
recommendations in the protocol to help in accelerating the search 
of a consensus between the cooperative agents and in finding 
an optimal solution we have also shown that the protocol 
has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge 
to the usual maximum solution moreover we tested this 
protocol in a crisis management context where the 
negotiation aim is where to evacuate a whole set of injured people 
to predefined hospitals 
we have already developed a first mas in particular 
integrating myriad to test this protocol in order to know 
more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and 
quickness in finding a consensus this prototype enabled 
us to solve some examples with our approach and the 
results we obtained are encouraging since we obtained quickly 
good agreements close to the pareto solution in the light 
of the initial constraints of the problem the availabilities 
we still have to improve our mas by taking into account 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the two types of recommendations and by adding a 
preference model to the mediator of our system moreover a 
comparative study has to be done in order to evaluate the 
performance of our framework against the existing ones and 
against some variations on the protocol
