abstract 
ontology matching is currently a key technology to achieve 
the semantic alignment of ontological entities used by 
knowledge-based applications and therefore to enable their 
interoperability in distributed environments such as 
multiagent systems most ontology matching mechanisms 
however assume matching prior integration and rely on 
semantics that has been coded a priori in concept hierarchies or 
external sources in this paper we present a formal model for 
a semantic alignment procedure that incrementally aligns 
differing conceptualisations of two or more agents relative 
to their respective perception of the environment or domain 
they are acting in it hence makes the situation in which 
the alignment occurs explicit in the model we resort to 
channel theory to carry out the formalisation

 introduction 
an ontology is commonly defined as a specification of the 
conceptualisation of a particular domain it fixes the 
vocabulary used by knowledge engineers to denote concepts and 
their relations and it constrains the interpretation of this 
vocabulary to the meaning originally intended by knowledge 
engineers as such ontologies have been widely adopted as 
a key technology that may favour knowledge sharing in 
distributed environments such as multi-agent systems 
federated databases or the semantic web but the proliferation 
of many diverse ontologies caused by different 
conceptualisations of even the same domain -and their subsequent 
specification using varying terminology- has highlighted 
the need of ontology matching techniques that are 
capable of computing semantic relationships between entities of 
separately engineered ontologies 
until recently most ontology matching mechanisms 
developed so far have taken a classical functional approach 
to the semantic heterogeneity problem in which ontology 
matching is seen as a process taking two or more 
ontologies as input and producing a semantic alignment of 
ontological entities as output furthermore matching 
often has been carried out at design-time before 
integrating knowledge-based systems or making them interoperate 
this might have been successful for clearly delimited and 
stable domains and for closed distributed systems but it is 
untenable and even undesirable for the kind of applications 
that are currently deployed in open systems multi-agent 
communication peer-to-peer information sharing and 
webservice composition are all of a decentralised dynamic and 
open-ended nature and they require ontology matching to 
be locally performed during run-time in addition in many 
situations peer ontologies are not even open for inspection 
 e g when they are based on commercially confidential 
information 
certainly there exist efforts to efficiently match 
ontological entities at run-time taking only those ontology 
fragment that are necessary for the task at hand 
nevertheless the techniques used by these systems to 
establish the semantic relationships between ontological entities 
-even though applied at run-time- still exploit a priori 
defined concept taxonomies as they are represented in the 
graph-based structures of the ontologies to be matched use 
previously existing external sources such as thesauri e g 
wordnet and upper-level ontologies e g cyc or sumo 
or resort to additional background knowledge repositories or 
shared instances 
we claim that semantic alignment of ontological 
terminology is ultimately relative to the particular situation in which 
the alignment is carried out and that this situation should 
be made explicit and brought into the alignment 
mechanism even two agents with identical conceptualisation 
capabilities and using exactly the same vocabulary to specify 
their respective conceptualisations may fail to interoperate 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
in a concrete situation because of their differing perception 
of the domain imagine a situation in which two agents 
are facing each other in front of a checker board agent 
a may conceptualise a figure on the board as situated on 
the left margin of the board while agent a may 
conceptualise the same figure as situated on the right although 
the conceptualisation of  left and  right is done in exactly 
the same manner by both agents and even if both use the 
terms left and right in their communication they still will 
need to align their respective vocabularies if they want to 
successfully communicate to each other actions that change 
the position of figures on the checker board their semantic 
alignment however will only be valid in the scope of their 
interaction within this particular situation or environment 
the same agents situated differently may produce a different 
alignment 
this scenario is reminiscent to those in which a group of 
distributed agents adapt to form an ontology and a shared 
lexicon in an emergent bottom-up manner with only local 
interactions and no central control authority this sort 
of self-organised emergence of shared meaning is namely 
ultimately grounded on the physical interaction of agents with 
the environment in this paper however we address the 
case in which agents are already endowed with a top-down 
engineered ontology it can even be the same one which 
they do not adapt or refine but for which they want to 
find the semantic relationships with separate ontologies of 
other agents on the grounds of their communication within a 
specific situation in particular we provide a formal model 
that formalises situated semantic alignment as a sequence of 
information-channel refinements in the sense of barwise and 
seligman s theory of information flow this theory is 
particularly useful for our endeavour because it models the flow 
of information occurring in distributed systems due to the 
particular situations -or tokens- that carry information 
analogously the semantic alignment that will allow 
information to flow ultimately will be carried by the particular 
situation agents are acting in 
we shall therefore consider a scenario with two or more 
agents situated in an environment each agent will have its 
own viewpoint of the environment so that if the 
environment is in a concrete state both agents may have different 
perceptions of this state because of these differences there 
may be a mismatch in the meaning of the syntactic 
entities by which agents describe their perceptions and which 
constitute the agents respective ontologies we state that 
these syntactic entities can be related according to the 
intrinsic semantics provided by the existing relationship 
between the agents viewpoint of the environment the 
existence of this relationship is precisely justified by the fact that 
the agents are situated and observe the same environment 
in section we describe our formal model for situated 
semantic alignment ssa first in section we associate 
a channel to the scenario under consideration and show how 
the distributed logic generated by this channel provides the 
logical relationships between the agents viewpoints of the 
environment second in section we present a method by 
which agents obtain approximations of this distributed logic 
these approximations gradually become more reliable as the 
method is applied in section we report on an application 
of our method conclusions and further work are analyzed 
in section finally an appendix summarizes the terms and 
theorems of channel theory used along the paper we do not 
assume any knowledge of channel theory we restate basic 
definitions and theorems in the appendix but any detailed 
exposition of the theory is outside the scope of this paper 
 a formal model for ssa 
 the logic of ssa 
consider a scenario with two agents a and a situated 
in an environment e the generalization to any numerable 
set of agents is straightforward we associate a numerable 
set s of states to e and at any given instant we suppose 
e to be in one of these states we further assume that 
each agent is able to observe the environment and has its 
own perception of it this ability is faithfully captured by 
a surjective function seei s → pi where i ∈ and 
typically see and see are different 
according to channel theory information is only viable 
where there is a systematic way of classifying some range 
of things as being this way or that in other words where 
there is a classification see appendix a so in order to be 
within the framework of channel theory we must associate 
classifications to the components of our system 
for each i ∈ we consider a classification ai that 
models ai s viewpoint of e first tok ai is composed of 
ai s perceptions of e states that is tok ai pi second 
typ ai contains the syntactic entities by which ai describes 
its perceptions the ones constituting the ontology of ai 
finally ai synthesizes how ai relates its perceptions with 
these syntactic entities 
now with the aim of associating environment e with a 
classification e we choose the power classification of s as e 
which is the classification whose set of types is equal to s 
 
whose tokens are the elements of s and for which a token 
e is of type ε if e ∈ ε the reason for taking the power 
classification is because there are no syntactic entities that 
may play the role of types for e since in general there is no 
global conceptualisation of the environment however the 
set of types of the power classification includes all possible 
token configurations potentially described by types thus 
tok e s typ e s 
and e e ε if and only if e ∈ ε 
the notion of channel see appendix a is fundamental in 
barwise and seligman s theory the information flow among 
the components of a distributed system is modelled in terms 
of a channel and the relationships among these components 
are expressed via infomorphisms see appendix a which 
provide a way of moving information between them 
the information flow of the scenario under consideration 
is accurately described by channel e fi ai → e i∈ 
defined as follows 
 ˆfi α e ∈ tok e seei e ai α for each α ∈ 
typ ai 
 ˇfi e seei e for each e ∈ tok e 
where i ∈ definition of ˇfi seems natural while ˆfi is 
defined in such a way that the fundamental property of the 
infomorphisms is fulfilled 
ˇfi e ai α iff seei e ai α by definition of ˇfi 
iff e ∈ ˆfi α by definition of ˆfi 
iff e e 
ˆfi α by definition of e

figure channel e 
e explains the information flow of our scenario by virtue 
of agents a and a being situated and perceiving the same 
environment e we want to obtain meaningful relations 
among agents syntactic entities that is agents types we 
state that meaningfulness must be in accord with e 
the sum operation see appendix a gives us a way of 
putting the two agents classifications of channel e together 
into a single classification namely a a and also the two 
infomorphisms together into a single infomorphism f f 
a a → e 
a a assembles agents classifications in a very coarse 
way tok a a is the cartesian product of tok a and 
tok a that is tok a a p p pi ∈ pi so a 
token of a a is a pair of agents perceptions with no 
restrictions typ a a is the disjoint union of typ a 
and typ a and p p is of type i α if pi is of type 
α we attach importance to take the disjoint union because 
a and a could use identical types with the purpose of 
describing their respective perceptions of e 
classification a a seems to be the natural place in 
which to search for relations among agents types now 
channel theory provides a way to make all these relations 
explicit in a logical fashion by means of theories and local 
logics see appendix a the theory generated by the sum 
classification th a a and hence its logic generated 
log a a involve all those constraints among agents 
types valid according to a a notice however that these 
constraints are obvious as we stated above meaningfulness 
must be in accord with channel e 
classifications a a and e are connected via the sum 
infomorphism f f f where 
 ˆf i α ˆfi α e ∈ tok e seei e ai α for 
each i α ∈ typ a a 
 ˇf e ˇf e ˇf e see e see e for each e ∈ 
tok e 
meaningful constraints among agents types are in accord 
with channel e because they are computed making use of f 
as we expound below 
as important as the notion of channel is the concept of 
distributed logic see appendix a given a channel c and 
a logic l on its core dlogc l represents the reasoning 
about relations among the components of c justified by l 
if l log c the distributed logic we denoted by log c 
captures in a logical fashion the information flow inherent 
in the channel 
in our case log e explains the relationship between the 
agents viewpoints of the environment in a logical fashion 
on the one hand constraints of th log e are defined by 
γ log e δ if ˆf γ log e 
ˆf δ 
where γ δ ⊆ typ a a on the other hand the set of 
normal tokens nlog e is equal to the range of function ˇf 
nlog e ˇf tok e 
 see e see e e ∈ tok e 
therefore a normal token is a pair of agents perceptions 
that are restricted by coming from the same environment 
state unlike a a tokens 
all constraints of th log e are satisfied by all normal 
tokens because of being a logic in this particular case this 
condition is also sufficient the proof is straightforward as 
alternative to we have 
γ log e δ iff for all e ∈ tok e 
if ∀ i γ ∈ γ seei e ai γ 
then ∃ j δ ∈ δ seej e aj δ 
where γ δ ⊆ typ a a 
log e is the logic of ssa th log e comprises the 
most meaningful constraints among agents types in accord 
with channel e in other words the logic of ssa contains 
and also justifies the most meaningful relations among those 
syntactic entities that agents use in order to describe their 
own environment perceptions 
log e is complete since log e is complete but it is not 
necessarily sound because although log e is sound ˇf is 
not surjective in general see appendix b if log e is also 
sound then log e log a a see appendix b that 
means there is no significant relation between agents points 
of view of the environment according to e it is just the fact 
that log e is unsound what allows a significant relation 
between the agents viewpoints this relation is expressed 
at the type level in terms of constraints by th log e and 
at the token level by nlog e 
 approaching the logic of ssa 
through communication 
we have dubbed log e the logic of ssa th log e 
comprehends the most meaningful constraints among agents 
types according to e the problem is that neither agent 
can make use of this theory because they do not know e 
completely in this section we present a method by which 
agents obtain approximations to th log e we also prove 
these approximations gradually become more reliable as the 
method is applied 
agents can obtain approximations to th log e through 
communication a and a communicate by exchanging 
information about their perceptions of environment states 
this information is expressed in terms of their own 
classification relations specifically if e is in a concrete state e 
we assume that agents can convey to each other which types 
are satisfied by their respective perceptions of e and which 
are not this exchange generates a channel c fi ai → 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
c i∈ and th log c contains the constraints among 
agents types justified by the fact that agents have observed 
e now if e turns to another state e and agents proceed 
as before another channel c fi ai → c i∈ gives 
account of the new situation considering also the previous 
information th log c comprises the constraints among 
agents types justified by the fact that agents have observed 
e and e the significant point is that c is a refinement of 
c see appendix a theorem below ensures that the 
refined channel involves more reliable information 
the communication supposedly ends when agents have 
observed all the environment states again this situation can 
be modeled by a channel call it c 
 f 
i ai → c 
 i∈ 
theorem states that th log c 
 th log e 
theorem and theorem assure that applying the 
method agents can obtain approximations to th log e 
gradually more reliable 
theorem let c fi ai → c i∈ and c 
 fi ai → c i∈ be two channels if c is a refinement 
of c then 
 th log c ⊆ th log c 
 nlog c ⊇ nlog c 
proof since c is a refinement of c then there exists a 
refinement infomorphism r from c to c so fi r ◦ fi let 
a def a a f def f f and f def f f 
 let γ and δ be subsets of typ a and assume that 
γ log c δ which means ˆf γ c 
ˆf δ we have 
to prove γ log c δ or equivalently ˆf γ c 
ˆf δ 
we proceed by reductio ad absurdum suppose c ∈ 
tok c does not satisfy the sequent ˆf γ ˆf δ then 
c c 
ˆf γ for all γ ∈ γ and c c 
ˆf δ for all δ ∈ δ 
let us choose an arbitrary γ ∈ γ we have that 
γ i α for some α ∈ typ ai and i ∈ thus 
ˆf γ ˆf i α ˆfi α ˆr ◦ ˆfi α ˆr ˆfi α 
therefore 
c c 
ˆf γ iff c c ˆr ˆfi α 
iff ˇr c c 
ˆfi α 
iff ˇr c c 
ˆf i α 
iff ˇr c c 
ˆf γ 
consequently ˇr c c 
ˆf γ for all γ ∈ γ since 
ˆf γ c 
ˆf δ then there exists δ 
∈ δ such that 
ˇr c c 
ˆf δ 
 a sequence of equivalences similar to 
the above one justifies c c 
ˆf δ 
 contradicting that c 
is a counterexample to ˆf γ ˆf δ hence γ log c δ 
as we wanted to prove 
 let a a ∈ tok a and assume a a ∈ nlog c 
therefore there exists c token in c such that a a 
ˇf c then we have ai ˇfi c ˇfi ◦ ˇr c ˇfi ˇr c 
for i ∈ hence a a ˇf ˇr c and a a ∈ 
nlog c consequently nlog c ⊇ nlog c which 
concludes the proof 
remark theorem asserts that the more refined 
channel gives more reliable information even though its 
theory has less constraints it has more normal tokens to 
which they apply 
in the remainder of the section we explicitly describe the 
process of communication and we conclude with the proof 
of theorem 
let us assume that typ ai is finite for i ∈ and s 
is infinite numerable though the finite case can be treated 
in a similar form we also choose an infinite numerable set 
of symbols cn 
 n ∈ n 
 
we omit informorphisms superscripts when no confusion 
arises types are usually denoted by greek letters and tokens 
by latin letters so if f is an infomorphism f α ≡ ˆf α and 
f a ≡ ˇf a 
agents communication starts from the observation of e 
let us suppose that e is in state e 
∈ s tok e a s 
perception of e 
is f e 
 and a s perception of e 
is f e 
 
we take for granted that a can communicate a those 
types that are and are not satisfied by f e 
 according to 
its classification a so can a do since both typ a and 
typ a are finite this process eventually finishes after 
this communication a channel c

 an example 
in the previous section we have described in great detail 
our formal model for ssa however we have not tackled 
the practical aspect of the model yet in this section we 
give a brushstroke of the pragmatic view of our approach 
we study a very simple example and explain how agents 
can use those approximations of the logic of ssa they can 
obtain through communication 
let us reflect on a system consisting of robots located in 
a two-dimensional grid looking for packages with the aim of 
moving them to a certain destination figure robots 
can carry only one package at a time and they can not move 
through a package 
figure the scenario 
robots have a partial view of the domain and there exist 
two kinds of robots according to the visual field they have 
some robots are capable of observing the eight adjoining 
squares but others just observe the three squares they have 
in front see figure we call them urdl shortened 
form of up-right-down-left and lcr abbreviation for 
left-center-right robots respectively 
describing the environment states as well as the robots 
perception functions is rather tedious and even unnecessary 
we assume the reader has all those descriptions in mind 
all robots in the system must be able to solve package 
distribution problems cooperatively by communicating their 
intentions to each other in order to communicate agents 
send messages using some ontology in our scenario there 
coexist two ontologies the udrl and lcr ontologies both 
of them are very simple and are just confined to describe 
what robots observe 
figure robots field of vision 
when a robot carrying a package finds another package 
obstructing its way it can either go around it or if there is 
another robot in its visual field ask it for assistance let 
us suppose two urdl robots are in a situation like the one 
depicted in figure robot the one carrying a package 
decides to ask robot for assistance and sends a request 
this request is written below as a kqml message and it 
should be interpreted intuitively as robot pick up the 
package located in my up square knowing that you are 
located in my up-right square 
 
request 
 sender robot 
 receiver robot 
 language packages distribution-language 
 ontology urdl-ontology 
 content pick up u package because ur robot 
´ 
figure robot assistance 
robot understands the content of the request and it can 
use a rule represented by the following constraint 
 ur robot ul robot u package 
 u package 
the above constraint should be interpreted intuitively as 
if robot is situated in robot s up-right square robot 
is situated in robot s up-left square and a package is 
located in robot s up square then a package is located 
in robot s up square 
now problems arise when a lcr robot and a urdl 
robot try to interoperate see figure robot sends a 
request of the form 
 
request 
 sender robot 
 receiver robot 
 language packages distribution-language 
 ontology lcr-ontology 
 content pick up r robot because c package 
´ 
robot does not understand the content of the request but 
they decide to begin a process of alignment -corresponding 
with a channel c 
 once finished robot searches in th c 
 
for constraints similar to the expected one that is those of 
the form 
 r robot ul robot c package 
c λ package 
where λ ∈ u r d l ur dr dl ul from these only 
the following constraints are plausible according to c

figure ontology mismatch 
 r robot ul robot c package 
c u package 
 r robot ul robot c package 
c l package 
 r robot ul robot c package 
c dr package 
if subsequently both robots adopting the same roles take 
part in a situation like the one depicted in figure a new 
process of alignment -corresponding with a channel c 
- takes 
place c 
also considers the previous information and hence 
refines c 
 the only constraint from the above ones that 
remains plausible according to c 
is 
 r robot ul robot c package 
c u package 
notice that this constraint is an element of the theory of the 
distributed logic agents communicate in order to cooperate 
successfully and success is guaranteed using constrains of the 
distributed logic

 conclusions and further work 
in this paper we have exposed a formal model of semantic 
alignment as a sequence of information-channel refinements 
that are relative to the particular states of the environment 
in which two agents communicate and align their respective 
conceptualisations of these states before us kent and 
kalfoglou and schorlemmer have applied channel 
theory to formalise semantic alignment using also barwise 
and seligman s insight to focus on tokens as the enablers 
of information flow their approach to semantic alignment 
however like most ontology matching mechanisms 
developed to date regardless of whether they follow a functional 
design-time-based approach or an interaction-based 
runtime-based approach still defines semantic alignment in 
terms of a priori design decisions such as the concept 
taxonomy of the ontologies or the external sources brought into 
the alignment process instead the model we have presented 
in this paper makes explicit the particular states of the 
environment in which agents are situated and are attempting 
to gradually align their ontological entities 
in the future our effort will focus on the practical side of 
the situated semantic alignment problem we plan to 
further refine the model presented here e g to include 
pragmatic issues such as termination criteria for the alignment 
process and to devise concrete ontology negotiation 
protocols based on this model that agents may be able to enact 
the formal model exposed in this paper will constitute a 
solid base of future practical results

a channel theory terms 
classification is a tuple a tok a typ a a where 
tok a is a set of tokens typ a is a set of types and 
 a is a binary relation between tok a and typ a if 
a a α then a is said to be of type α 
infomorphism f a → b from classifications a to b is 
a contravariant pair of functions f ˆf ˇf where ˆf 
typ a → typ b and ˇf tok b → tok a satisfying 
the following fundamental property 
ˇf b a α iff b b 
ˆf α 
for each token b ∈ tok b and each type α ∈ typ a 
channel consists of two infomorphisms c fi ai → 
c i∈ with a common codomain c called the core 
of c c tokens are called connections and a connection 
c is said to connect tokens ˇf c and ˇf c 
sum given classifications a and b the sum of a and b 
denoted by a b is the classification with tok a

relation a b defined by

a b a b β if b b β 
given infomorphisms f a → c and g b → c 
the sum f g a b → c is defined on types by 
ˆ f g α ˆf α and ˆ f g β ˆg β and 
on tokens by ˇ f g c ˇf c ˇg c

normal that is nl tok l l is complete if every 
sequent of typ l satisfied by every normal token is a 
constraint of th l
