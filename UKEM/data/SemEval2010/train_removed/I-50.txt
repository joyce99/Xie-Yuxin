abstract 
logics of knowledge and belief are often too static and 
inflexible to be used on real-world problems in particular they 
usually offer no concept for expressing that some course of 
events is more likely to happen than another we address 
this problem and extend ctlk computation tree logic 
with knowledge with a notion of plausibility which allows 
for practical and counterfactual reasoning the new logic 
ctlkp ctlk with plausibility includes also a 
particular notion of belief a plausibility update operator is added 
to this logic in order to change plausibility assumptions 
dynamically furthermore we examine some important 
properties of these concepts in particular we show that for a 
natural class of models belief is a kd modality we also 
show that model checking ctlkp is ptime-complete

 introduction 
notions like time knowledge and beliefs are very 
important for analyzing the behavior of agents and multi-agent 
systems in this paper we extend modal logics of time and 
knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior this notion 
is added to the language of ctlk which is a 
straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic 
ctl and standard epistemic logic 
in our approach plausibility can be seen as a temporal 
property of behaviors that is some behaviors of the 
system can be assumed plausible and others implausible with 
the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be 
ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses 
of action moreover behaviors can be formally understood 
as temporal paths in the kripke structure modeling a 
multiagent system as a consequence we obtain a language to 
reason about what can or must plausibly happen we 
propose a particular notion of beliefs inspired by 
defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility the 
main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would 
know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen 
we believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility 
and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday 
reasoning restricting one s reasoning to plausible possibilities is 
essential to make the reasoning feasible as the space of all 
possibilities is exceedingly large in real life we investigate 
some important properties of plausibility knowledge and 
belief in this new framework in particular we show that 
knowledge is an s modality and that beliefs satisfy 
axioms k in general and kd for the class of plausibly 
serial models finally we show that the relationship 
between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is 
natural and reflects the initial intuition well we also show 
how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object 
language via a plausibility update operator and we study 
properties of such updates finally we show that model 
checking of the new logic is no more complex than model 
checking ctl and ctlk 
our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that 
allows the study of strategies time knowledge and 
plausible rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect 
information as combining all these dimensions is highly 
nontrivial cf it seems reasonable to split this task 
while this paper deals with knowledge plausibility and 
belief the companion paper proposes a general framework 
for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical 
rationality criteria like nash equilibrium pareto optimality etc 
the latter approach is based on the more powerful logic 
atl 
the paper is structured as follows firstly we briefly 
present branching-time logic with knowledge ctlk in 
section we present our approach to plausibility and 
formally define ctlk with plausibility we also show how 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
temporal formulae can be used to describe plausible paths 
and we compare our logic with existing related work in 
section properties of knowledge belief and plausibility are 
explored finally we present verification complexity results 
for ctlkp in section 
 branching time and knowledge 
in this paper we develop a framework for agents beliefs 
about how the world can or must evolve thus we need a 
notion of time and change plus a notion of what the agents 
are supposed to know in particular situations ctlk 
is a straightforward combination of the computation tree 
logic ctl and standard epistemic logic 
ctl includes operators for temporal properties of 
systems i e path quantifier e there is a path together 
with temporal operators f in the next state 
 always from now on and u until 
every occurrence of 
a temporal operator is preceded by exactly one path 
quantifier in ctl this variant of the language is sometimes called 
vanilla ctl epistemic logic uses operators for 
representing agents knowledge kaϕ is read as agent a knows 
that ϕ 
let π be a set of atomic propositions with a typical 
element p and agt k be a set of agents with a typical 
element a the language of ctlk consists of formulae ϕ 
given as follows 
ϕ p ¬ϕ ϕ ∧ ϕ eγ kaϕ 
γ fϕ ϕ ϕu ϕ 
we will sometimes refer to formulae ϕ as vanilla state 
formulae and to formulae γ as vanilla path formulae 
the semantics of ctlk is based on kripke models m 
q r ∼ ∼k π which include a nonempty set of states 
q a state transition relation r ⊆ q × q epistemic 
indistinguishability relations ∼a⊆ q × q one per agent and a 
valuation of propositions π π → p q we assume that 
relation r is serial and that all ∼a are equivalence relations 
a path λ in m refers to a possible behavior or 
computation of system m and can be represented as an infinite 
sequence of states that follow relation r that is a sequence 
q q q such that qirqi for every i we 
denote the ith state in λ by λ i the set of all paths in m 
is denoted by λm if the model is clear from context m 
will be omitted a q-path is a path that starts from q 
i e λ q a q-subpath is a sequence of states starting 
from q which is a subpath of some path in the model i e 
a sequence q q such that q q and there are q 
 qi 
such that q 
 qi 
q q ∈ λm 
the semantics of ctlk is 
defined as follows 
m q p iff q ∈ π p 
m q ¬ϕ iff m q ϕ 
m q ϕ ∧ ψ iff m q ϕ and m q ψ 
m q e fϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that m λ ϕ 
m q e ϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that m λ i ϕ 
for every i ≥ 
 
additional operators a for every path and ♦ 
 sometime in the future are defined in the usual way 
 
for ctlk models λ is a q-subpath iff it is a q-path it 
will not always be so when plausible paths are introduced 
m q eϕu ψ iff there is a q-path λ and i ≥ such that 
m λ i ψ and m λ j ϕ for every ≤ j i 
m q kaϕ iff m q ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q 
 extending time and knowledge 
with plausibility and beliefs 
in this section we discuss the central concept of this 
paper i e the concept of plausibility first we outline the 
idea informally then we extend ctlk with the notion 
of plausibility by adding plausible path operators pl a and 
physical path operator ph to the logic formula pl aϕ has 
the intended meaning according to agent a it is plausible 
that ϕ holds formula ph ϕ reads as ϕ holds in all 
physically possible scenarios i e even in implausible ones the 
plausible path operator restricts statements only to those 
paths which are defined to be sensible whereas the 
physical path operator generates statements about all paths that 
may theoretically occur furthermore we define beliefs on 
top of plausibility and knowledge as the facts that an agent 
would know if he assumed that only plausible things could 
happen finally we discuss related work 
and compare it with our approach 
 the concept of plausibility 
it is well known how knowledge or beliefs can be 
modeled with kripke structures however it is not so obvious 
how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way 
in one framework clearly there should be a connection 
between these two notions our approach is to use the 
notion of plausibility for this purpose plausibility can serve 
as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics 
of beliefs in a similar way as indistinguishability of states 
 represented by relation ∼a is the semantic concept that 
underlies knowledge in this sense our work follows 
essentially beliefs are what an agent would know if he took 
only plausible options into account in our approach 
however plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property 
that is we do not consider states or possible worlds to be 
more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors 
to be plausible and others implausible moreover 
behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the 
kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system 
an actual notion of plausibility that is a particular set of 
plausible paths can emerge in many different ways it may 
result from observations and learning an agent can learn 
from its observations and see specific patterns of events as 
plausible a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a 
suit knowledge exchange is another possibility e g an 
agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he 
is smiling game theory with its rationality criteria 
 undominated strategies maxmin nash equilibrium etc is 
another viable source of plausibility assumptions last but not 
least folk knowledge can be used to establish 
plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior players normally want 
to win a game people want to live 
in any case restricting the reasoning to plausible 
possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning 
feasible as the space of all possibilities we call them physical 
possibilities in the rest of the paper is exceedingly large in 
real life of course this does not exclude a more extensive 
analysis in special cases e g when our plausibility 
assumptions do not seem accurate any more or when the cost of 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
inaccurate assumptions can be too high as in the case of 
high-budget business decisions but even in these cases we 
usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely 
- we only revise them to make them more cautious 
to formalize this idea we extend models of ctlk with 
sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators pl a 
physical paths operator ph and belief operators ba to the 
language of ctlk now it is possible to make statements 
that refer to plausible paths only as well as statements that 
regard all paths that may occur in the system 
 ctlk with plausibility 
in this section we extend the logic of ctlk with 
plausibility we call the resulting logic ctlkp formally the 
language of ctlkp is defined as 
ϕ p ¬ϕ ϕ ∧ ϕ eγ pl aϕ ph ϕ kaϕ baϕ 
γ fϕ ϕ ϕu ϕ 
for instance we may claim it is plausible to assume that 
a shop is closed after the opening hours though the manager 
may be physically able to open it at any time pl aa late → 
¬open ∧ ph e♦ late ∧ open 
the semantics of ctlkp extends that of ctlk as 
follows firstly we augment the models with sets of plausible 
paths a model with plausibility is given as 
m q r ∼ ∼k υ υk π 
where q r ∼ ∼k π is a ctlk model and υa ⊆ λm 
is the set of paths in m that are plausible according to agent 
a if we want to make it clear that υa is taken from model 
m we will write υm 
a it seems worth emphasizing that this 
notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic it is 
subjective because υa represents agent a s subjective view on what 
is plausible - and indeed different agents may have 
different ideas on plausibility i e υa may differ from υb it is 
holistic because υa represents agent a s idea of the 
plausible behavior of the whole system including the behavior of 
other agents 
remark in our models plausibility is also global i e 
plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system 
investigating systems in which plausibility is relativized with 
respect to states like in might be an interesting avenue 
of future work however such an approach - while obviously 
more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system 
descriptions for example it might be the case that path λ 
is plausible in q λ but the set of plausible paths in 
q λ is empty that is by following plausible path λ we 
are bound to get to an implausible situation but then does 
it make sense to consider λ as plausible 
secondly we use a non-standard satisfaction relation p 
which we call plausible satisfaction let m be a ctlkp 
 
that is when planning to open an industrial plant in the 
uk we will probably consider the possibility of our main 
contractor taking her life but we will still not take into 
account the possibilities of an invasion of ufo england being 
destroyed by a meteorite fidel castro becoming the british 
prime minister etc note that this is fundamentally different 
from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely 
scenarios are assigned very low probabilities in that case 
they also have a very small influence on our final decision 
but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities 
to evaluate the options 
model and p ⊆ λm be an arbitrary subset of paths in m 
 not necessarily any υm 
a p restricts the evaluation of 
temporal formulae to the paths given in p only the 
absolute satisfaction relation is defined as λm 
let on p be the set of all states that lie on at least one 
path in p i e on p q ∈ q ∃λ ∈ p∃i λ i q now 
the semantics of ctlkp can be given through the 
following clauses 
m q p p iff q ∈ π p 
m q p ¬ϕ iff m q p ϕ 
m q p ϕ ∧ ψ iff m q p ϕ and m q p ψ 
m q p e fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ p such that 
m λ p ϕ 
m q p e ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ p such that 
m λ i p ϕ for every i ≥ 
m q p eϕu ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ p and i ≥ 
such that m λ i p ψ and m λ j p ϕ for every 
 ≤ j i 
m q p pl aϕ iff m q υa 
ϕ 
m q p ph ϕ iff m q ϕ 
m q p kaϕ iff m q ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q 
m q p baϕ iff for all q ∈ on υa with q ∼a q we have 
that m q υa 
ϕ 
one of the main reasons for using the concept of 
plausibility is that we want to define agents beliefs out of more 
primitive concepts - in our case these are plausibility and 
indistinguishability - in a way analogous to if an 
agent knows that ϕ he must be sure about it however 
beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts 
still they should make sense to the agent if he believes that 
ϕ then the formula should at least hold in all futures that 
he envisages as plausible thus beliefs of an agent may be 
seen as things known to him if he disregards all non-plausible 
possibilities 
we say that ϕ is m-true m ϕ if m q ϕ for all 
q ∈ qm ϕ is valid ϕ if m ϕ for all models m ϕ 
is m-strongly true m ≡ ϕ if m q p ϕ for all q ∈ qm 
and all p ⊆ λm ϕ is strongly valid ≡ ϕ if m ≡ ϕ for all 
models m 
proposition strong truth and strong validity imply 
truth and validity respectively the reverse does not hold 
ultimately we are going to be interested in normal not 
strong validity as parameterizing the satisfaction relation 
with a set p is just a technical device for propagating sets 
of plausible paths υa into the semantics of nested formulae 
the importance of strong validity however lies in the fact 
that ≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable 
while the same is not true for normal validity 
proposition let φ ϕ ψ denote formula φ in which 
every occurrence of ψ was replaced by ϕ also let ≡ ϕ ↔ ψ 
then for all m q p m q p φ iff m q p φ ϕ ψ in 
particular m q φ iff m q φ ϕ ψ 
note that ϕ ↔ ψ does not even imply that m q φ iff 
m q φ ϕ ψ

figure guessing robots game 
example guessing robots consider a simple 
game with two agents a and b shown in figure first 
a chooses a real number r ∈ without revealing the 
number to b then b chooses a real number r ∈ 
the agents win the game and collect eur if 
both chose otherwise they lose formally we model the 
game with a ctlkp model m in which the set of states 
q includes qs for the initial situation states qr r ∈ 
for the situations after a has chosen number r and final 
states qw ql for the winning and the losing situation 
respectively the transition relation is as follows qsrqr and 
qrrql for all r ∈ q rqw qwrqw and qlrql moreover 
π one q and π win qw player a has perfect 
information in the game i e q ∼a q iff q q but player 
b does not distinguish between states qr i e qr ∼b qr for 
all r r ∈ obviously the only sensible thing to do 
for both agents is to choose using game-theoretical 
vocabulary these strategies are strongly dominant for the 
respective players thus there is only one plausible course of 
events if we assume that our players are rational and hence 
υa υb qsq qwqw 
note that in principle the outcome of the game is 
uncertain m qs ¬a♦ win∧¬a ¬win however assuming 
rationality of the players makes it only plausible that the game 
must end up with a win m qs pla a♦ win ∧ plb a♦ win 
and the agents believe that this will be the case m qs 
baa♦ win ∧ bba♦ win note also that in any of the states 
qr agent b believes that a being rational has played 
m qr bbone for all r ∈ 
 defining plausible paths with formulae 
so far we have assumed that sets of plausible paths are 
somehow given in models in this section we present a 
dynamic approach where an actual notion of plausibility can 
be specified in the object language note that we want to 
specify usually infinite sets of infinite paths and we need a 
finite representation of these structures one logical solution 
is given by using path formulae γ these formulae describe 
properties of paths therefore a specific formula can be used 
to characterize a set of paths for instance think about a 
country in africa where it has never snowed then 
plausible paths might be defined as ones in which it never snows 
i e all paths that satisfy ¬snows formally let γ be a 
ctlk path formula we define γ m to be the set of paths 
that satisfy γ in model m 
 fϕ m λ m λ ϕ 
 ϕ m λ ∀i m λ i ϕ 
 ϕ u ϕ m λ ∃i 
 
m λ i ϕ ∧ 
∀j ≤ j i ⇒ m λ j ϕ 
´ 
 
moreover we define the plausible paths model update as 
follows let m q r ∼ ∼k υ υk π be a 
ctlkp model and let p ⊆ λm be a set of paths then 
ma p 
 q r ∼ ∼k υ υa− p υa υk π 
denotes model m with a s set of plausible paths reset to p 
now we can extend the language of ctlkp with 
formulae set-pla γ ϕ with the intuitive reading suppose that 
γ exactly characterizes the set of plausible paths then ϕ 
holds and formal semantics given below 
m q p set-pla γ ϕ iff ma γ m q p ϕ 
we observe that this update scheme is similar to the one 
proposed in 
 comparison to related work 
several modal notions of plausibility were already 
discussed in the existing literature in these 
papers like in ours plausibility is used as a primitive 
semantic concept that helps to define beliefs on top of agents 
knowledge a similar idea was introduced by moses and 
shoham in their work preceded both and 
 and although moses and shoham do not explicitly mention 
the term plausibility it seems appropriate to summarize 
their idea first 
moses and shoham beliefs as conditional knowledge 
in beliefs are relativized with respect to a formula α 
 which can be seen as a plausibility assumption expressed 
in the object language more precisely worlds that satisfy α 
can be considered as plausible this concept is expressed via 
symbols bα 
i ϕ the index i ∈ is used to distinguish 
between three different implementations of beliefs the first 
version is given by bα 
 ϕ ≡ k α → ϕ 
a drawback of 
this version is that if α is false then everything will be 
believed with respect to α the second version overcomes 
this problem bα 
 ϕ ≡ k α → ϕ ∧ k¬α → kϕ now ϕ is 
only believed if it is known that ϕ follows from assumption 
α and ϕ must be known if assumption α is known to be false 
finally bα 
 ϕ ≡ k α → ϕ ∧ ¬k¬α if the assumption α is 
known to be false nothing should be believed with respect to 
α the strength of these different notions is given as follows 
bα 
 ϕ implies bα 
 ϕ and bα 
 ϕ implies bα 
 ϕ in this approach 
belief is strongly connected to knowledge in the sense that 
belief is knowledge with respect to a given assumption 
friedman and halpern plausibility spaces 
the work of friedman and halpern extends the concepts 
of knowledge and belief with an explicit notion of 
plausibility i e some worlds are more plausible for an agent 
than others to implement this idea kripke models are 
extended with function p which assigns a plausibility space 
p q a ω q a q a to every state or more generally 
every possible world q and agent a the plausibility space 
 
unlike in most approaches k is interpreted over all worlds 
and not only over the indistinguishable worlds 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
is just a partially ordered subset of states worlds that is 
ω q a ⊆ q and q a ⊆ q ×q is a reflexive and transitive 
relation let s t ⊆ ω q a be finite subsets of states now 
t is defined to be plausible given s with respect to p q a 
denoted by s →p q a t iff all minimal points states in 
s with respect to q a are also in t 
friedman and 
halpern s view to modal plausibility is closely related to 
probability and more generally plausibility measures 
logics of plausibility can be seen as a qualitative description of 
agents preferences knowledge logics of probability 
on the other hand offer a quantitative description 
the logic from is defined by the following grammar 
ϕ p ϕ∧ϕ ¬ϕ kaϕ ϕ →a ϕ where the semantics of 
all operators except →a is given as usual and formulae ϕ →a 
ψ have the meaning that ψ is true in the most plausible 
worlds in which ϕ holds formally the semantics for →a 
is given as m q ϕ →a ψ iff sϕ 
p q a →p q a 
sψ 
p q a 
where sϕ 
 q a q ∈ ω q a m q ϕ are the states in 
ω q a that satisfy ϕ the idea of defining beliefs is given 
by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he 
knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of ω q a 
formally this can be stated as baϕ ≡ ka →a ϕ 
friedman and halpern have shown that the kd 
axioms are valid for operator ba if plausibility spaces satisfy 
consistency for all states q ∈ q it holds that ω q a ⊆ q ∈ 
q q ∼a q and normality for all states q ∈ q it holds 
that ω q a ∅ 
a temporal extension of the language 
 mentioned briefly in and discussed in more detail in 
uses the interpreted systems approach a system r 
is given by runs where a run r n → q is a function from 
time moments modeled by n to global states and a time 
point r i is given by a time point i ∈ n and a run r a 
global state is a combination of local states one per agent 
an interpreted system m r π is given by a system r 
and a valuation of propositions π epistemic relations are 
defined over time points i e r m ∼a r m iff agent 
a s local states ra m and ra m of r m and r m are 
equal formulae are interpreted in a straightforward way 
with respect to interpreted systems e g m r m kaϕ iff 
m r m ϕ for all r m ∼a r m now these are time 
points that play the role of possible worlds consequently 
plausibility spaces p r m a are assigned to each point r m 
and agent a 
su et al kbc logic 
su et al have developed a multi-modal 
computationally grounded logic with modalities k b and c knowledge 
belief and certainty the computational model consists of 
 global states q qvis 
 qinv 
 qper 
 qpls 
 where the 
environment is divided into a visible qvis 
 and an invisible part 
 qinv 
 and qper 
captures the agent s perception of the visible 
part of the environment external sources may provide the 
agent with information about the invisible part of a state 
which results in a set of states qpls 
that are plausible for 
the agent 
given a global state q we additionally define v is q 
qvis 
 inv q qinv 
 per q qper 
 and pls q qpls 
 the 
 
when there are infinite chains q q a q the 
definition is much more sophisticated an interested reader 
is referred to for more details 
 
note that this normality is essentially seriality of states 
wrt plausibility spaces 
semantics is given by an extension of interpreted systems 
 here it is called interpreted kbc systems kbc 
formulae are defined as ϕ p ¬ϕ ϕ ∧ ϕ kϕ bϕ cϕ 
the epistemic relation ∼vis is captured in the following way 
 r i ∼vis r i iff v is r i v is r i the semantic 
clauses for belief and certainty are given below 
m r i bϕ iff m r i ϕ for all r i with v is r i 
per r i and inv r i ∈ pls r i 
m r i cϕ iff m r i ϕ for all r i with v is r i 
per r i 
thus an agent believes ϕ if and only if ϕ is true in all 
states which look like what he sees now and seem plausible 
in the current state certainty is stronger if an agent is 
certain about ϕ the formula must hold in all states with 
a visible part equal to the current perception regardless of 
whether the invisible part is plausible or not 
the logic does not include temporal formulae although 
it might be extended with temporal operators as time is 
already present in kbc models 
what are the differences to our logic 
in our approach plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal 
property i e it is a property of temporal paths rather than 
states in the object language this is reflected by the fact 
that plausibility assumptions are specified through path 
formulae in contrast the approach of and is static 
not only the logics do not include operators for talking about 
time and or change but these are states that are assumed 
plausible or not in their semantics 
the differences to are more subtle firstly the 
framework of friedman and halpern is static in the sense 
that plausibility is taken as a property of abstract 
possible worlds this formulation is flexible enough to allow for 
incorporating time still in our approach time is inherent 
to plausibility rather than incidental 
secondly our framework is more computationally oriented 
the implementation of temporal plausibility in is based 
on the interpreted systems approach with time points r m 
being subject to plausibility as runs are included in time 
points they can also be defined plausible or implausible 
however it also means that time points serve the role of 
possible worlds in the basic formulation which yields kripke 
structures with uncountable possible world spaces in all but 
the most trivial cases 
thirdly build on linear time a run more precisely 
a time moment r m is fixed when a formula is interpreted 
in contrast we use branching time with explicit 
quantification over temporal paths 
we believe that branching time 
is more suitable for non-deterministic domains cf e g 
of which multi-agent systems are a prime example note 
that branching time makes our notion of belief different from 
friedman and halpern s most notably property kϕ → bϕ 
is valid in their approach but not in ours an agent may 
 
friedman and halpern even briefly mention how 
plausibility of runs can be embedded in their framework 
 
to be more precise time in does implicitly branch at 
epistemic states this is because r m ∼a r m iff a s 
local state corresponding to both time points is the same 
 ra m ra m in consequence the semantics of kaϕ 
can be read as for every run and every moment on this 
run that yields the same local state as now ϕ holds 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
know that some course of events is in principle possible 
without believing that it can really become the case see 
section as proposition suggests such a subtle 
distinction between knowledge and beliefs is possible in our 
approach because branching time logics allow for existential 
quantification over runs 
fourthly while friedman and halpern s models are very 
flexible they also enable system descriptions that may seem 
counterintuitive suppose that r m is plausible in itself 
 formally r m is minimal wrt r m a but r m is 
not plausible in r m this means that following the 
plausible path makes it implausible cf remark which 
is even stranger in the case of linear time combining the 
argument with computational aspects we suggest that our 
approach can be more natural and straightforward for many 
applications 
last but not least our logic provides a mechanism for 
specifying and updating sets of plausible paths in the 
object language thus plausibility sets can be specified in a 
succinct way which is another feature that makes our 
framework computation-friendly the model checking results from 
section are especially encouraging in this light 
 plausibility knowledge and 
beliefs in ctlkp 
in this section we study some relevant properties of 
plausibility knowledge and beliefs in particular axioms kdt 
are examined but first we identify two important 
subclasses of models with plausibility 
a ctlkp model is plausibly serial or p-serial for agent 
a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path 
according to a i e on υa q as we will see further a 
weaker requirement is sometimes sufficient we call a model 
weakly p-serial if every state has at least one 
indistinguishable counterpart which lies on a plausible path i e for each 
q ∈ q there is a q ∈ q such that q ∼a q and q ∈ on υa 
obviously p-seriality implies weak p-seriality we get the 
following characterization of both model classes 
proposition m is plausibly serial for agent a iff 
formula pl ae f is valid in m m is weakly p-serial for agent 
a iff ¬kapl aa f⊥ is valid in m 
 axiomatic properties 
theorem axioms k d and for knowledge are 
strongly valid and axiom t is valid that is modalities ka 
form system s in the sense of normal validity and kd 
in the sense of strong validity 
we do not include proofs here due to lack of space the 
interested reader is referred to where detailed proofs are 
given 
proposition axioms k and for beliefs are 
strongly valid that is we have 
 ≡ baϕ ∧ ba ϕ → ψ → baψ ≡ baϕ → babaϕ and 
 ≡ ¬baϕ → ba¬baϕ 
the next proposition concerns the consistency axiom 
d baϕ → ¬ba¬ϕ it is easy to see that the axiom is not 
valid in general as we have no restrictions on plausibility 
sets υa it may be as well that υa ∅ in that case we have 
baϕ ∧ ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ because the set of states to 
be considered becomes empty however it turns out that d 
is valid for a very natural class of models 
proposition axiom d for beliefs is not valid in the 
class of all ctlkp models however it is strongly valid in 
the class of weak p-serial models and therefore also in the 
class of p-serial models 
moreover as one may expect beliefs do not have to be 
always true 
proposition axiom t for beliefs is not valid i e 
 baϕ → ϕ the axiom is not even valid in the class of 
p-serial models 
theorem belief modalities ba form system k in 
the class of all models and kd in the class of weakly 
plausibly serial models in the sense of both normal and 
strong validity axiom t is not even valid for p-serial 
models 
 plausibility knowledge and beliefs 
first we investigate the relationship between knowledge 
and plausibility physicality operators then we look at the 
interaction between knowledge and beliefs 
proposition let ϕ be a ctlkp formula and m 
be a ctlkp model we have the following strong validities 
 i ≡ pl akaϕ ↔ kaϕ 
 ii ≡ ph kaϕ ↔ kaph ϕ and ≡ kaph ϕ ↔ kaϕ 
we now want to examine the relationship between 
knowledge and belief for instance if agent a believes in 
something he knows that he believes it or if he knows a fact 
he also believes that he knows it on the other hand for 
instance an agent does not necessarily believe in all the 
things he knows for example we may know that an 
invasion from another galaxy is in principle possible kae♦ 
invasion but if we do not take this possibility as plausible 
 ¬pl ae♦ invasion then we reject the corresponding belief 
in consequence ¬bae♦ invasion note that this property 
reflects the strong connection between belief and plausibility 
in our framework 
proposition the following formulae are strongly 
valid 
 i baϕ → kabaϕ ii kabaϕ → baϕ 
 iii kaϕ → bakaϕ 
the following formulae are not valid 
 iv baϕ → bakaϕ v kaϕ → baϕ 
the last invalidity is especially important it is not the 
case that knowing something implies believing in it this 
emphasizes that we study a specific concept of beliefs here 
note that its specific is not due to the plausibility-based 
definition of beliefs the reason lies rather in the fact that we 
investigate knowledge beliefs and plausibility in a temporal 
framework as proposition shows 
proposition let ϕ be a ctlkp formula that does 
not include any temporal operators then kaϕ → baϕ is 
strongly valid and in the class of p-serial models we have 
even that ≡ kaϕ ↔ baϕ 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
moreover it is important that we use branching time with 
explicit quantification over paths this observation is 
formalized in proposition 
definition we define the universal sublanguage of 
ctlk in a way similar to 
ϕu p ¬p ϕu ∧ ϕu ϕu ∨ ϕu aγu kaϕu 
γu fϕu ϕu ϕuu ϕu 
we call such ϕu universal formulae and γu universal path 
formulae 
proposition let ϕu be a universal ctlk formula 
then ≡ kaϕu → baϕu 
the following two theorems characterize the relationship 
between knowledge and beliefs first for the class of p-serial 
models and then finally for all models 
theorem the following formulae are strongly valid 
in the class of plausibly serial ctlkp models 
 i baϕ ↔ kapl aϕ ii kaϕ ↔ baph ϕ 
theorem formula baϕ ↔ kapl a e f → ϕ is 
strongly valid 
note that this characterization has a strong commonsense 
reading believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in 
all plausibly imaginable situations 
 properties of the update 
the first notable property of plausibility update is that it 
influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role 
i e ones in which belief or plausibility modalities occur 
proposition let ϕ be a ctlkp formula that does 
not include operators pl a and ba and γ be a ctlkp path 
formula then we have ≡ ϕ ↔ set-pla γ ϕ 
what can be said about the result of an update at first 
sight formula set-pla γ pl aaγ seems a natural 
characterization however it is not valid this is because by leaving 
the other implausible paths out of scope we may leave out 
of γ some paths that were needed to satisfy γ see the 
example in section we propose two alternative ways out 
the first one restricts the language of the update similarly 
to the other refers to physical possibilities in a way 
analogous to 
proposition the ctlkp formula set-pla γ pl aaγ 
is not valid however we have the following validities 
 i ≡ set-pla γu pl aaγu where γu is a universal ctlk 
path formula from definition 
 ii if ϕ ϕ ϕ are arbitrary ctlk formulae then 
 ≡ set-pla 
fϕ pl aa f ph ϕ 
 ≡ set-pla ϕ pl aa ph ϕ and 
 ≡ set-pla ϕ u ϕ pl aa ph ϕ u ph ϕ 
 verification of plausibility 
time and beliefs 
in this section we report preliminary results on model 
checking ctlkp formulae clearly verifying ctlkp 
properties directly against models with plausibility does not 
make much sense since these models are inherently infinite 
what we need is a finite representation of plausibility sets 
one such representation has been discussed in section 
plausibility sets can be defined by path formulae and the 
update operator set-pla γ 
we follow this idea here studying the complexity of model 
checking ctlkp formulae against ctlk models which 
can be seen as a compact representation of ctlkp 
models in which all the paths are assumed plausible with the 
underlying idea that plausibility sets when needed must be 
defined explicitly in the object language below we sketch 
an algorithm that model-checks ctlkp formulae in time 
linear wrt the size of the model and the length of the 
formula this means that we have extended ctlk to a more 
expressive language with no computational price to pay 
first of all we get rid of the belief operators due to 
theorem replacing every occurrence of baϕ with kapl a e f 
→ ϕ now let −→γ γ γk be a vector of vanilla 
path formulae one per agent with the initial vector −→γ 
 and −→γ γ a denoting vector −→γ in which −→γ a 
is replaced with γ additionally we define −→γ we 
translate the resulting ctlkp formulae to ones without 
plausibility via function tr ϕ tr−→γ ϕ defined as 
follows 
tr−→γ i p p 
tr−→γ i ϕ ∧ ϕ tr−→γ i ϕ ∧ tr−→γ i ϕ 
tr−→γ i ¬ϕ ¬tr−→γ i ϕ 
tr−→γ i kaϕ ka tr−→γ ϕ 
tr−→γ i pla ϕ tr−→γ a ϕ 
tr−→γ i set-pla γ ϕ tr−→γ γ a i ϕ 
tr−→γ i ph ϕ tr−→γ ϕ 
tr−→γ i fϕ ftr−→γ i ϕ 
tr−→γ i ϕ tr−→γ i ϕ 
tr−→γ i ϕ u ϕ tr−→γ i ϕ u tr−→γ i ϕ 
tr−→γ i eγ e −→γ i ∧ tr−→γ i γ 
note that the resulting sentences belong to the logic of 
ctlk that is ctl where each path quantifier can be 
followed by a boolean combination of vanilla path 
formulae 
with epistemic modalities the following proposition 
justifies the translation 
proposition for any ctlkp formula ϕ without 
ba we have that m q ctlkp ϕ iff m q ctlk tr ϕ 
in general model checking ctl and also ctlk 
is δp 
 -complete however in our case the boolean 
combinations of path subformulae are always conjunctions of at 
most two non-negated elements which allows us to propose 
the following model checking algorithm first subformulae 
are evaluated recursively for every subformula ψ of ϕ the 
set of states in m that satisfy ψ is computed and labeled 
with a new proposition pψ now it is enough to define 
checking m q ϕ for ϕ in which all state subformulae 
are propositions with the following cases 
case m q e p ∧ γ if m q p then return no 
otherwise remove from m all the states that do not satisfy 
p yielding a sparser model m and check the ctl 
formula eγ in m q with any ctl model-checker 
case m q e fp ∧ γ create m by adding a copy q of 
state q in which only the transitions to states 
satisfying p are kept i e m q r iff m q r and q rq 
iff qrq and m q p then check eγ in m q 
 
for the semantics of ctl and discussion of model 
checking complexity cf 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
case m q e p u p ∧ p u p note that this is 
equivalent to checking e p ∧ p u p ∧ ep u p ∨ e p ∧ 
p u p ∧ ep u p which is a ctl formula 
other cases the above cases cover all possible formulas 
that begin with a path quantifier for other cases 
standard ctlk model checking can be used 
theorem model checking ctlkp against ctlk 
models is ptime-complete and can be done in time o ml 
where m is the number of transitions in the model and l is 
the length of the formula to be checked that is the 
complexity is no worse than for ctlk itself 
 conclusions 
in this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered 
with the underlying idea that implausible options should be 
usually ignored in practical reasoning about possible future 
courses of action we add the new notion of plausibility to 
the logic of ctlk and obtain a language which 
enables reasoning about what can or must plausibly happen 
as a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting 
logic we use a non-standard satisfaction relation p that 
allows to propagate the current set of plausible paths into 
subformulae furthermore we propose a non-standard 
notion of beliefs defined in terms of indistinguishability and 
plausibility we also propose how plausibility assumptions 
can be specified in the object language via a plausibility 
update operator in a way similar to 
we use this new framework to investigate some important 
properties of plausibility knowledge beliefs and updates 
in particular we show that knowledge is an s modality 
and that beliefs satisfy axioms k in general and kd 
for the class of plausibly serial models we also prove that 
believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all 
plausibly possible situations that is the relationship between 
knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the 
initial intuition precisely moreover the model checking 
results from section show that verification for ctlkp is 
no more complex than for ctl and ctlk 
we would like to stress that we do not see this contribution 
as a mere technical exercise in formal logic human agents 
use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs 
in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search 
space and make the reasoning feasible as a consequence we 
suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable 
for modeling design and analysis resource-bounded agents 
in general
