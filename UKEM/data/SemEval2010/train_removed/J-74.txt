motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative 
lack of security this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in 
sealed-bid auctions the first type of cheating we consider 
occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price 
auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the 
payment of the winning bidder in the second type a bidder 
cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing 
bids before deciding on his own bid in both cases we derive 
equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the 
possibility of cheating these results provide insights into 
sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating including some 
counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a 
first-price auction

 introduction 
among the types of auctions commonly used in practice 
sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they 
require little communication and can be completed almost 
instantly each bidder simply submits a bid and the winner 
is immediately determined however sealed-bid auctions 
do require that the bids be kept private until the auction 
clears the increasing popularity of online auctions only 
makes this disadvantage more troublesome at an auction 
house with all participants present it is difficult to examine 
a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer 
however in an online auction the auctioneer is often little 
more than a server with questionable security and since all 
participants are in different locations one can anonymously 
attempt to break into the server in this paper we present a 
game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when 
they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on 
knowledge of the bids 
we investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions 
whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats and 
which variant either first or second-price of the sealed-bid 
auction is used note that two of these cases are trivial 
in our setting there is no incentive for the seller to submit 
a shill bid in a first price auction because doing so would 
either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the 
winning bidder in a second-price auction knowing the 
competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant 
strategy to bid truthfully this leaves us with two cases that 
we examine in detail 
a seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by 
looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting 
an extra bid this possibility was pointed out as early as 
the seminal paper that introduced this type of auction 
for example if the bidders in an ebay auction each use a 
proxy bidder essentially creating a second-price auction 
then the seller may be able to break into ebay s server 
observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay and 
then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below 
it using a false identity we assume that there is no chance 
that the seller will be caught when it cheats however not 
all sellers are willing to use this power or not all sellers can 
successfully cheat we assume that each bidder knows the 
probability with which the seller will cheat possible 
motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e 
on seller cheating in ebay auctions in this setting we derive 
an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each 
bidder s value for the good is independently drawn from a 
common distribution with no further assumptions except 
for continuity and differentiability this result shows how 
first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the 
endpoints of a spectrum of auctions 
but why should the seller have all the fun in a first-price 
auction a bidder must bid below his value for the good also 
called shaving his bid in order to have positive utility if he 
 
wins to decide how much to shave his bid he must trade off 
the probability of winning the auction against how much he 
will pay if he does win of course if he could simply examine 
the other bids before submitting his own then his problem 
is solved bid the minimum necessary to win the auction 
in this setting our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding 
strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the 
possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders when 
bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed 
uniform distribution we show the counterintuitive result that 
the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on 
the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder this result 
is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium 
of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating 
we conclude this section by exploring other distributions 
including some in which the presence of cheating bidders 
actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid 
the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 
 we formalize the setting and present our results for the 
case of a seller cheating in a second price auction section 
 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction 
in section we quantify the effects that the possibility of 
cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings we 
discuss related work including other forms of cheating in 
auctions in section before concluding with section all 
proofs and derivations are found in the appendix 
 second-price auction 
cheating seller 
in this section we consider a second-price auction in which 
the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after 
observing all of the bids the formulation for this section will be 
largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating 
in a first-price auction while no prior knowledge of game 
theory or auction theory is assumed good introductions can 
be found in and respectively 
 formulation 
the setting consists of n bidders or agents indexed by 
i · · · n and a seller each agent has a type θi ∈ 
 drawn from a continuous range which represents the 
agent s value for the good being auctioned 
each agent s 
type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution 
function cdf f over where f and f 
we assume that f · is strictly increasing and differentiable 
over the interval call the probability density function 
 pdf f θi f θi which is the derivative of the cdf 
each agent knows its own type θi but only the 
distribution over the possible types of the other agents a bidding 
strategy for an agent bi → maps its type to its 
bid 
let θ θ · · · θn be the vector of types for all agents 
and θ−i θ · · · θi− θi · · · θn be the vector of all 
types except for that of agent i we can then combine the 
vectors so that θ θi θ−i we also define the vector of 
bids as b θ b θ bn θn and this vector without 
 
we can restrict the types to the range without loss 
of generality because any distribution over a different range 
can be normalized to this range 
 
we thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies 
but because of our continuity assumption there always 
exists a pure strategy equilibrium 
the bid of agent i as b−i θ−i let b θ be the value of the 
highest bid of the vector b θ with a corresponding 
definition for b θ−i 
an agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater 
than all other bids but ties complicate the formulation 
fortunately we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because 
our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability 
event in equilibrium we assume that the seller does not set 
a reserve price 
if the seller does not cheat then the winning agent pays 
the highest bid by another agent on the other hand if 
the seller does cheat then the winning agent will pay its 
bid since we assume that a cheating seller would take full 
advantage of its power let the indicator variable µc 
be 
if the seller cheats and otherwise the probability that 
the seller cheats pc 
 is known by all agents 
we can then 
write the payment of the winning agent as follows 
pi b θ µc 
 µc 
· bi θi − − µc 
 · b θ−i 
let µ · be an indicator function that takes an inequality 
as an argument and returns is if it holds and otherwise 
the utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction 
and the difference between its valuation and its price if it 
does 
ui b θ µc 
 θi µ bi θi b θ−i · θi − pi b θ µc 
 
 
we will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent 
with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents 
and over whether or not the seller cheats by pushing the 
expectation inward so that it is only over the price 
 conditioned on the agent winning the auction we can write the 
expected utility as 
eθ−i µc ui b θ µc 
 θi prob bi θi b θ−i · 
θi − eθ−i µc pi b θ µc 
 bi θi b θ−i 
we assume that all agents are rational expected utility 
maximizers because of the uncertainty over the types of 
the other agents we will be looking for a bayes-nash 
equilibrium a vector of bidding strategies b 
is a bayes-nash 
equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi 
agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an 
alternate bidding strategy bi holding the bidding strategies 
for all other agents fixed formally b 
is a bayes-nash 
equilibrium if 
∀i θi bi eθ−i µc ui b 
i θi b 
−i θ−i µc 
 θi ≥ 
eθ−i µc ui bi θi b 
−i θ−i µc 
 θi 
 equilibrium 
we first present the bayes-nash equilibrium for an 
arbitrary distribution f · 
 
this simplifies the analysis but all of our results can be 
applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve 
price before the auction begins 
 
note that common knowledge is not necessary for the 
existence of an equilibrium 
 
theorem in a second-price auction in which the seller 
cheats with probability pc 
 it is a bayes-nash equilibrium for 
each agent to bid according to the following strategy 
bi θi θi − 
θi 
 
f n− 
p c 
 x dx 
f n− 
p c 
 θi 
 
it is useful to consider the extreme points of pc 
 setting 
pc 
 yields the correct result for a first-price auction see 
e g in the case of pc 
 this solution is not defined 
however in the limit bi θi approaches θi as pc 
approaches 
 which is what we expect as the auction approaches a 
standard second-price auction 
the position of pc 
is perhaps surprising for example the 
linear combination bi θi θi − pc 
· 
θi 
 f n− 
 x dx 
f n− θi 
of the 
equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price 
auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies 
for the cases of pc 
 and pc 
 
 continuum of auctions 
an alternative perspective on the setting is as a 
continuum between first and second-price auctions consider a 
probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is 
honest but the price paid by the winning agent is determined 
by a weighted coin flip with probability pc 
it is his bid 
and with probability − pc 
it is the second-highest bid 
by adjusting pc 
 we can smoothly move between a first 
and second-price auction furthermore the fact that this 
probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the 
revenue equivalence theorem see e g provides a way 
to verify that the bidding strategy in equation is the 
symmetric equilibrium of this auction see the alternative proof 
of theorem in the appendix 
 special case uniform distribution 
another way to try to gain insight into equation is by 
instantiating the distribution of types we now consider the 
often-studied uniform distribution f θi θi 
corollary in a second-price auction in which the 
seller cheats with probability pc 
 and f θi θi it is a 
bayes-nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to 
the following strategy 
bi θi 
n − 
n − pc 
θi 
this equilibrium bidding strategy parameterized by pc 
 
can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known 
results when pc 
 the bidding strategy is now 
welldefined each agent bids its true type while when pc 
 
we get the correct result for a first-price auction each agent 
bids according to the strategy bi θi n− 
n 
θi 
 first-price auction 
cheating agents 
we now consider the case in which the seller is honest 
but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the 
other bids before submitting their own or alternatively 
they will revise their bid before the auction clears since 
this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction 
we only analyze the case of a first-price auction after 
revising the formulation from the previous section we present a 
fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an 
arbitrary distribution f · this equation will be useful for the 
analysis the uniform distribution in which we show that the 
possibility of cheating agents does not change the 
equilibrium strategy of honest agents this result has implications 
for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to 
overbidding in a standard first-price auction furthermore we find 
that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a 
competing agent to shave more off of its bid 
 formulation 
it is clear that if a single agent is cheating he will bid 
 up to his valuation the minimum amount necessary to win 
the auction it is less obvious though what will happen if 
multiple agents cheat one could imagine a scenario similar 
to an english auction in which all cheating agents keep 
revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good 
at the current winning bid however we are only concerned 
with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware 
of the possibility of cheating thus it suffices for an honest 
agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if 
its bid exceeds every other honest agent s bid and every 
cheating agent s type 
this intuition can be formalized as the following 
discriminatory auction in the first stage each agent s payment 
rule is determined with probability pa 
 the agent will pay 
the second highest bid if it wins the auction essentially 
he is a cheater and otherwise it will have to pay its bid 
these selections are recorded by a vector of indicator 
variables µa 
 µa 
 µan 
 where µai 
 denotes that agent 
i pays the second highest bid each agent knows the 
probability pa 
 but does not know the payment rule for all other 
agents otherwise this auction is a standard sealed-bid 
auction it is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid 
its true type making this formulation strategically 
equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph the 
expression for the utility of an honest agent in this 
discriminatory auction is as follows 
ui b θ µa 
 θi θi − bi θ · 
j i 
µaj 
· µ bi θi θj − µaj 
 · µ bi θi bj θj 
 
 equilibrium 
our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating 
agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and 
honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy 
since we have left f · unspecified we cannot present a 
closed form solution for the honest agent s bidding strategy 
and instead give a fixed point equation for it 
theorem in a first-price auction in which each agent 
cheats with probability pa 
 it is a bayes-nash equilibrium 
for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy 
that is a fixed point of the following equation 
bi θi θi − 
θi 
 pa · f bi x − pa · f x 
 n− 
dx 
pa · f bi θi − pa · f θi 
 n− 
 
 
 special case uniform distribution 
since we could not solve equation in the general case 
we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the 
equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of f · 
a natural place to start is uniform distribution f θi θi 
recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy 
in a first-price auction without cheating bi θi n− 
n 
θi is 
the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of 
winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning given 
that the other agents are bidding according to the same 
strategy since in the current setting the cheating agents 
do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest 
agent s probability of winning while obviously not affecting 
the price that an honest agent pays if he wins it is 
natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by 
increasing his bid the idea is that sacrificing some 
potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of 
winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into 
balance however it turns out that the equilibrium bidding 
strategy is unchanged 
corollary in a first-price auction in which each agent 
cheats with probability pa 
 and f θi θi it is a 
bayesnash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid 
according to the strategy bi θi n− 
n 
θi 
this result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price 
auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the 
uniform distribution since the best response is unaffected 
by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always 
bidding their type in fact as long as all other agents shave 
their bid by a fraction which can differ across the agents no 
greater than 
n 
 it is still a best response for the remaining 
agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy note 
that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their 
bid by a negative fraction and are thus irrationally bidding 
above their type 
theorem in a first-price auction where f θi θi if 
each agent j i bids according a strategy bj θj 
n− αj 
n 
θj 
where αj ≥ then it is a best response for the remaining 
agent i to bid according to the strategy bi θi n− 
n 
θi 
obviously these strategy profiles are not equilibria unless 
each αj because each agent j has an incentive to set 
αj the point of this theorem is that a wide range of 
possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies 
of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium 
strategy this is important because a common and valid 
criticism of equilibrium concepts such as nash and 
bayesnash is that they are silent on how the agents converge 
on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate 
however if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a 
large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium then 
it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed 
converge on this equilibrium 
it is important to note though that while this equilibrium 
is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave 
less it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off 
of its bid in fact if we take any strategy profile consistent 
with the conditions of theorem and change a single agent 
j s strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative then 
agent i s best response is to shave more than 
n 
off of its 
bid 
 effects of overbidding for 
other distributions 
a natural question is whether the best response bidding 
strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing 
agents for other distributions it turns out that theorem 
 holds for all distributions of the form f θi θi k 
 where 
k is some positive integer however taking a simple linear 
combination of two such distributions to produce f θi 
θ 
i θi 
 
yields a distribution in which an agent should 
actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids 
less in the example we present for this distribution with 
the details in the appendix there are only two players and 
the deviation by one agent is to bid his type however it 
can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other 
deviations 
example in a first-price auction where f θi 
θ 
i θi 
 
and n if agent always bids its type b θ θ 
then for all θ agent s best response bidding strategy 
is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric 
equilibrium 
we also note that the same result holds for the normalized 
exponential distribution f θi eθi − 
e− 
 
it is certainly the case that distributions can be found 
that support the intuition given above that agents should 
shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise 
examples include f θi − 
 
θ 
i 
 
θi the solution to the 
system of equations f θi − f and f 
and f θi e−e −θi 
e− 
 
it would be useful to relate the direction of the change 
in the best response bidding strategy to a general 
condition on f · unfortunately we were not able to find such 
a condition in part because the integral in the symmetric 
bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved 
without knowing f · or at least some restrictions on it 
we do note however that the sign of the second 
derivative of f θi f θi is an accurate predictor for all of the 
distributions that we considered 
 revenue loss for an 
honest seller 
in both of the settings we covered an honest seller suffers 
a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating 
the equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us 
to quantify this loss although this is as far as we will take 
the analysis it could be applied to more general settings 
in which the seller could for example choose the market 
in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to 
oversee the auction 
in a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat an 
honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave 
their bids for the case in which agent types are drawn from 
the uniform distribution every agent will shave its bid by 
p c 
n− p c which is thus also the fraction by which an honest 
seller s revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating 
analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents 
may cheat is not so straightforward if pa 
 each agent 
cheats with certainty then we simply have a second-price 
auction and the seller s expected revenue will be unchanged 
again considering the uniform distribution for agent types 
it is not surprising that pa 
 
 
causes the seller to lose 
 
the most revenue however even in this worst case the 
percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than 
it is for the second-price auction in which pc 
 
 
 as shown 
in table 
it turns out that setting pc 
 would make 
the expected loss of these two settings comparable while 
this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful 
for a seller it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of 
possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than 
agents actually cheating themselves

table the percentage of expected revenue lost

in the two settings considered in this paper agent 
valuations are drawn from the uniform distribution 
 related work 
existing work covers another dimension along which we 
could analyze cheating altering the perceived value of n 
in this paper we have assumed that n is known by all 
of the bidders however in an online setting this 
assumption is rather tenuous for example a bidder s only source 
of information about n could be a counter that the seller 
places on the auction webpage or a statement by the seller 
about the number of potential bidders who have indicated 
that they will participate in these cases the seller could 
arbitrarily manipulate the perceived n in a first-price 
auction the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the 
perceived value of n in order to induce agents to bid closer 
to their true valuation however if agents are aware that 
the seller has this power then any communication about 
n to the agents is cheap talk and furthermore is not 
credible thus in equilibrium the agents would ignore the 
declared value of n and bid according to their own prior 
beliefs about the number of agents if we make the natural 
assumption of a common prior then the setting reduces to 
the one tackled by which derived the equilibrium 
bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of 
bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed 
to any of the bidders of course instead of assuming that 
the seller can always exploit this power we could assume 
that it can only do so with some probability that is known 
by the agents the analysis would then proceed in a similar 
manner as that of our cheating seller model 
the other interesting case of this form of cheating is by 
bidders in a first-price auction bidders would obviously 
want to decrease the perceived number of agents in order 
to induce their competition to lower their bids while it is 
 
note that we have not considered the costs of the seller 
thus the expected loss in profit could be much greater than 
the numbers that appear here 
unreasonable for bidders to be able to alter the perceived 
n arbitrarily collusion provides an opportunity to decrease 
the perceived n by having only one of a group of colluding 
agents participate in the auction while the non-colluding 
agents would account for this possibility as long as they are 
not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave 
more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did 
not take place this issue is tackled in 
other types of collusion are of course related to the 
general topic of cheating in auctions results on collusion in 
first and second-price auctions can be found in and 
respectively 
the work most closely related to our first setting is 
which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in 
a second-price auction in their setting the seller is a 
participant in the bayesian game who decides between running 
a first-price auction where profitable cheating is never 
possible or second-price auction the seller makes this choice 
after observing his type which is his probability of having 
the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price 
auction the bidders who know the distribution from which 
the seller s type is drawn then place their bid it is shown 
that in equilibrium only a seller with the maximum 
probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price 
auction our work differs in that we focus on the agents 
strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability 
of cheating by the seller an explicit derivation of the 
equilibrium strategies then allows us relate first and second-price 
auctions 
an area of related work that can be seen as 
complementary to ours is that of secure auctions which takes the point 
of view of an auction designer the goals often extend 
well beyond simply preventing cheating including 
properties such as anonymity of the bidders and nonrepudiation of 
bids cryptographic methods are the standard weapon of 
choice here see 
 conclusion 
in this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid 
auctions in which cheating is possible in addition to providing 
strategy profiles that are stable against deviations these 
results give us with insights into both first and second-price 
auctions the results for the case of a cheating seller in a 
second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as 
endpoints along a continuum the case of agents cheating in 
a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price 
auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the 
uniform distribution we also explored the effect of 
overbidding on the best response bidding strategy for other 
distributions and showed that even for relatively simple 
distributions it can be positive negative or neutral finally 
results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the 
expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of 
cheating

theorem in a second-price auction in which the seller 
cheats with probability pc 
 it is a bayes-nash equilibrium for 
each agent to bid according to the following strategy 
bi θi θi −

proof to find an equilibrium we start by guessing that 
there exists an equilibrium in which all agents bid 
according to the same function bi θi because the game is 
symmetric further we guess that bi θi is strictly increasing 
and differentiable over the range we can also assume 
that bi because negative bids are not allowed and 
a positive bid is not rational when the agent s valuation is 
 note that these are not assumptions on the setting- they 
are merely limitations that we impose on our search 
let φi bi → be the inverse function of bi θi 
that is it takes a bid for agent i as input and returns the 
type θi that induced this bid recall equation 
eθ−i µc ui b θ µc 
 θi prob bi θi b θ−i · 
θi − eθ−i µc pi b θ µc 
 bi θi b θ−i 
the probability that a single other bid is below that of 
agent i is equal to the cdf at the type that would induce 
a bid equal to that of agent i which is formally written as 
f φi bi θi since all agents are independent the 
probability that all other bids are below agent i s is simply this 
term raised the n − -th power 
thus we can re-write the expected utility as 
eθ−i µc ui b θ µc 
 θi fn− 
 φi bi θi · 
θi − eθ−i µc pi b θ µc 
 bi θi b θ−i 
we now solve for the expected payment plugging 
equation which gives the price for the winning agent into the 
term for the expected price in equation and then 
simplifying the expectation yields 
eθ−i µc pi b θ µc

note that the integral on the last line is taken up to 
bi θi because we are conditioning on the fact that bi θi

we start with the cdf for a given value b θ−i the 
probability that any one agent s bid is less than this value is equal 
to f φi b θ−i we then condition on the agent s bid

alternative proof of theorem 
the following proof uses the revenue equivalence 
theorem ret and the probabilistic auction given as an 
interpretation of our cheating seller setting 
in a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating 
the expected payment for an agent with type θi is simply 
the product of its bid and the probability that this bid is 
the highest for the symmetric equilibrium this is equal to 
f n− 
 θi · θi − 
θi 
 
f n− 
 x dx 
f n− θi 
for our probabilistic auction the expected payment of 
the winning agent is a weighted average of its bid and the 
second highest bid for the bi · we found in the original 
interpretation of the setting it can be written as follows 
f n−

by the ret the expected payments will be the same 
in the two auctions thus we can verify our equilibrium 
bidding strategy by showing that the expected payment in 
the two auctions is equal since the expected payment is 
zero at θi for both functions it suffices to verify that the 
derivatives of the expected payment functions with respect 
to θi are equal for an arbitrary value θi thus we need to 
verify the following equation

agent i will have a higher bid than another honest agent is 
still f φi bi θi while the probability is f bi θi if the 
other agent cheats the probability that agent i beats a 
single other agent is then a weighted average of these two
