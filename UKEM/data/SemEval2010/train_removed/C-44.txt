abstract 
wireless sensor networks have been proposed for use in 
many location-dependent applications most of these need to 
identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes a challenging 
task because of the severe constraints on cost energy and 
effective range of sensor devices to overcome limitations in 
existing solutions we present a multi-sequence positioning msp 
method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in 
outdoor environments the novel idea behind msp is to 
reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for 
each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node 
sequences easily obtained through loosely guided event 
distribution starting from a basic msp design we propose four 
optimizations which work together to increase the localization 
accuracy we address several interesting issues such as 
incomplete partial node sequences and sequence flip found in the 
mirage test-bed we built we have evaluated the msp system 
through theoretical analysis extensive simulation as well as 
two physical systems an indoor version with micaz motes 
and an outdoor version with micaz motes this 
evaluation demonstrates that msp can achieve an accuracy within 
one foot requiring neither additional costly hardware on 
sensor nodes nor precise event distribution it also provides a nice 
tradeoff between physical cost anchors and soft cost events

 introduction 
although wireless sensor networks wsn have shown 
promising prospects in various applications researchers 
still face several challenges for massive deployment of such 
networks one of these is to identify the location of 
individual sensor nodes in outdoor environments because of 
unpredictable flow dynamics in airborne scenarios it is not currently 
feasible to localize sensor nodes during massive uva-based 
deployment on the other hand geometric information is 
indispensable in these networks since users need to know where 
events of interest occur e g the location of intruders or of a 
bomb explosion 
previous research on node localization falls into two 
categories range-based approaches and range-free approaches 
range-based approaches compute per-node 
location information iteratively or recursively based on 
measured distances among target nodes and a few anchors which 
precisely know their locations these approaches generally 
require costly hardware e g gps and have limited 
effective range due to energy constraints e g ultrasound-based 
tdoa although range-based solutions can be 
suitably used in small-scale indoor environments they are 
considered less cost-effective for large-scale deployments on the 
other hand range-free approaches do not 
require accurate distance measurements but localize the node 
based on network connectivity proximity information 
unfortunately since wireless connectivity is highly influenced by the 
environment and hardware calibration existing solutions fail 
to deliver encouraging empirical results or require substantial 
survey and calibration on a case-by-case basis 
realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the 
large-scale outdoor environment researchers have recently 
proposed solutions e g spotlight and lighthouse 
for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal 
correlation of controlled events i e inferring nodes locations based 
on the detection time of controlled events these solutions 
demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can 
be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at 
sensor nodes these benefits however come along with an 
implicit assumption that the controlled events can be precisely 
distributed to a specified location at a specified time we argue 
that precise event distribution is difficult to achieve especially 
at large scale when terrain is uneven the event distribution 
device is not well calibrated and its position is difficult to 
maintain e g the helicopter-mounted scenario in 
to address these limitations in current approaches in this 
paper we present a multi-sequence positioning msp method 
 
for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in 
deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors 
the novel idea behind msp is to estimate each sensor node s 
two-dimensional location by processing multiple easy-to-get 
one-dimensional node sequences e g event detection order 
obtained through loosely-guided event distribution 
this design offers several benefits first compared to a 
range-based approach msp does not require additional costly 
hardware it works using sensors typically used by sensor 
network applications such as light and acoustic sensors both of 
which we specifically consider in this work second compared 
to a range-free approach msp needs only a small number of 
anchors theoretically as few as two so high accuracy can be 
achieved economically by introducing more events instead of 
more anchors and third compared to spotlight msp does not 
require precise and sophisticated event distribution an 
advantage that significantly simplifies the system design and reduces 
calibration cost 
this paper offers the following additional intellectual 
contributions 
 we are the first to localize sensor nodes using the concept 
of node sequence an ordered list of sensor nodes sorted 
by the detection time of a disseminated event we 
demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded 
in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly 
improve localization accuracy interestingly we discover 
that repeated reprocessing of one-dimensional node 
sequences can further increase localization accuracy 
 we propose a distribution-based location estimation 
strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using 
the marginal probability of joint distribution among 
adjacent nodes within the sequence this new algorithm 
outperforms the widely adopted centroid estimation 
 to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to 
improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive 
events the generation of later events is guided by 
localization results from previous events 
 we evaluate line-based msp on our new mirage test-bed 
and wave-based msp in outdoor environments through 
system implementation we discover and address several 
interesting issues such as partial sequence and sequence 
flips to reveal msp performance at scale we provide 
analytic results as well as a complete simulation study

 related work 
many methods have been proposed to localize wireless 
sensor devices in the open air most of these can be 
classified into two categories range-based and range-free 
localization range-based localization systems such as gps 
cricket ahlos aoa robust 
quadrilaterals and sweeps are based on fine-grained 
point-topoint distance estimation or angle estimation to identify 
pernode location constraints on the cost energy and hardware 
footprint of each sensor node make these range-based 
methods undesirable for massive outdoor deployment in addition 
ranging signals generated by sensor nodes have a very limited 
effective range because of energy and form factor concerns 
for example ultrasound signals usually effectively propagate 
 - feet using an on-board transmitter consequently 
these range-based solutions require an undesirably high 
deployment density although the received signal strength 
indicator rssi related methods were once considered 
an ideal low-cost solution the irregularity of radio 
propagation seriously limits the accuracy of such systems the 
recently proposed rips localization system superimposes 
two rf waves together creating a low-frequency envelope that 
can be accurately measured this ranging technique performs 
very well as long as antennas are well oriented and 
environmental factors such as multi-path effects and background noise 
are sufficiently addressed 
range-free methods don t need to estimate or measure 
accurate distances or angles instead anchors or controlled-event 
distributions are used for node localization range-free 
methods can be generally classified into two types anchor-based 
and anchor-free solutions 
 for anchor-based solutions such as centroid apit 
 serloc gradient and aps the main 
idea is that the location of each node is estimated based on 
the known locations of the anchor nodes different anchor 
combinations narrow the areas in which the target nodes 
can possibly be located anchor-based solutions normally 
require a high density of anchor nodes so as to achieve 
good accuracy in practice it is desirable to have as few 
anchor nodes as possible so as to lower the system cost 
 anchor-free solutions require no anchor nodes instead 
external event generators and data processing platforms 
are used the main idea is to correlate the event detection 
time at a sensor node with the known space-time 
relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection 
time-stamps can be mapped into the locations of sensors 
spotlight and lighthouse work in this fashion 
in spotlight the event distribution needs to be 
precise in both time and space precise event distribution 
is difficult to achieve without careful calibration 
especially when the event-generating devices require certain 
mechanical maneuvers e g the telescope mount used in 
spotlight all these increase system cost and reduce 
localization speed stardust which works much faster 
uses label relaxation algorithms to match light spots 
reflected by corner-cube retro-reflectors ccr with sensor 
nodes using various constraints label relaxation 
algorithms converge only when a sufficient number of robust 
constraints are obtained due to the environmental impact 
on rf connectivity constraints however stardust is less 
accurate than spotlight 
in this paper we propose a balanced solution that avoids 
the limitations of both anchor-based and anchor-free solutions 
unlike anchor-based solutions msp allows a flexible 
tradeoff between the physical cost anchor nodes with the soft

cost localization events msp uses only a small number of 
anchors theoretically as few as two unlike anchor-free 
solutions msp doesn t need to maintain rigid time-space 
relationships while distributing events which makes system design 
simpler more flexible and more robust to calibration errors 
 system overview 
msp works by extracting relative location information from 
multiple simple one-dimensional orderings of nodes 
figure a shows a layout of a sensor network with anchor nodes 
and target nodes target nodes are defined as the nodes to be 
localized briefly the msp system works as follows first 
events are generated one at a time in the network area e g 
ultrasound propagations from different locations laser scans 
with diverse angles as each event propagates as shown in 
figure a each node detects it at some particular time 
instance for a single event we call the ordering of nodes which 
is based on the sequential detection of the event a node 
sequence each node sequence includes both the targets and the 
anchors as shown in figure b second a multi-sequence 
processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of 
each node to a small area figure c finally a 
distributionbased estimation method estimates the exact location of each 
sensor node as shown in figure d 
figure shows that the node sequences can be obtained 
much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance 
measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via 
ranging methods in addition this system does not require a rigid 
time-space relationship for the localization events which is 
critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution 
scenarios e g spotlight 
for the sake of clarity in presentation we present our system 
in two cases 
 ideal case in which all the node sequences obtained 
from the network are complete and correct and nodes are 
time-synchronized 
 realistic deployment in which i node sequences can 
be partial incomplete ii elements in sequences could 
flip i e the order obtained is reversed from reality and 
 iii nodes are not time-synchronized 
to introduce the msp algorithm we first consider a simple 
straight-line scan scenario then we describe how to 
implement straight-line scans as well as other event types such as 
sound wave propagation

figure obtaining multiple node sequences 
 basic msp 
let us consider a sensor network with n target nodes and 
m anchor nodes randomly deployed in an area of size s the 
top-level idea for basic msp is to split the whole sensor 
network area into small pieces by processing node sequences 
because the exact locations of all the anchors in a node sequence 
are known all the nodes in this sequence can be divided into 
o m parts in the area 
in figure we use numbered circles to denote target nodes 
and numbered hexagons to denote anchor nodes basic msp 
uses two straight lines to scan the area from different directions 
treating each scan as an event all the nodes react to the event 
sequentially generating two node sequences for vertical scan 
 the node sequence is a c b as shown 
outside the right boundary of the area in figure for 
horizontal scan the node sequence is c a b 
as shown under the bottom boundary of the area in figure 
since the locations of the anchor nodes are available the 
anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area 
vertically and horizontally into parts as shown in figure 
to extend this process suppose we have m anchor nodes and 
perform d scans from different angles obtaining d node 
sequences and dividing the area into many small parts 
obviously the number of parts is a function of the number of 
anchors m the number of scans d the anchors location as well as 
the slop k for each scan line according to the pie-cutting 
theorem the area can be divided into o m d parts when 
m and d are appropriately large the polygon for each target 
node may become sufficiently small so that accurate 
estimation can be achieved we emphasize that accuracy is affected 
not only by the number of anchors m but also by the number 
of events d in other words msp provides a tradeoff between 
the physical cost of anchors and the soft cost of events 
algorithm depicts the computing architecture of basic 
msp each node sequence is processed within line to for 
each node getboundaries in line searches for the 
predecessor and successor anchors in the sequence so as to 
determine the boundaries of this node then in line updatemap 
shrinks the location area of this node according to the newly 
obtained boundaries after processing all sequences centroid 
estimation line set the center of gravity of the final 
polygon as the estimated location of the target node 
basic msp only makes use of the order information 
between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence

each sequence section will introduce advanced msp in 
which four novel optimizations are proposed to improve the 
performance of msp significantly 
 advanced msp 
four improvements to basic msp are proposed in this 
section the first three improvements do not need additional 
sensing and communication in the networks but require only 
slightly more off-line computation the objective of all these 
improvements is to make full use of the information embedded 
in the node sequences the results we have obtained 
empirically indicate that the implementation of the first two methods 
can dramatically reduce the localization error and that the third 
and fourth methods are helpful for some system deployments 
 sequence-based msp 
as shown in figure each scan line and m anchors splits 
the whole area into m parts each target node falls into 
one polygon shaped by scan lines we noted that in basic msp 
only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each 
target node but actually there is more information in the node 
sequence that we can made use of 
let s first look at a simple example shown in figure the 
previous scans narrow the locations of target node and node 
 into two dashed rectangles shown in the left part of figure 
then a new scan generates a new sequence with 
knowledge of the scan s direction it is easy to tell that node is 
located to the left of node thus we can further narrow the 
location area of node by eliminating the shaded part of node 
 s rectangle this is because node is located on the right of 
node while the shaded area is outside the lower boundary of 
node similarly the location area of node can be narrowed 
by eliminating the shaded part out of node s right boundary 
we call this procedure sequence-based msp which means that 
the whole node sequence needs to be processed node by node 
in order specifically sequence-based msp follows this exact 
processing rule

elimination rule along a scanning direction the lower 
boundary of the successor s area must be equal to or larger 
than the lower boundary of the predecessor s area and the 
upper boundary of the predecessor s area must be equal to or 
smaller than the upper boundary of the successor s area 
in the case of figure node is the successor of node 
and node is the predecessor of node according to the 
elimination rule node s lower boundary cannot be smaller 
than that of node and node s upper boundary cannot exceed 
node s upper boundary 
algorithm illustrates the pseudo code of sequence-based 
msp each node sequence is processed within line to the 
sequence processing contains two steps 
step line to compute and modify the lower 
boundary for each target node by increasing order in the node 
sequence each node s lower boundary is determined by the 
lower boundary of its predecessor node in the sequence thus 
the processing must start from the first node in the sequence 
and by increasing order then update the map according to the 
new lower boundary 
step line to compute and modify the upper 
boundary for each node by decreasing order in the node sequence 
each node s upper boundary is determined by the upper 
boundary of its successor node in the sequence thus the processing 
must start from the last node in the sequence and by 
decreasing order then update the map according to the new upper 
boundary 
after processing all the sequences for each node a polygon 
bounding its possible location has been found then 
center-ofgravity-based estimation is applied to compute the exact 
location of each node line to 
an example of this process is shown in figure the third 
scan generates the node sequence b c a in 
addition to the anchor split lines because nodes and come 
after node in the sequence node and s polygons could 
be narrowed according to node s lower boundary the lower 
right-shaded area similarly the shaded area in node s 
rectangle could be eliminated since this part is beyond node s 
upper boundary indicated by the dotted line similar 
eliminating can be performed for node as shown in the figure

from above we can see that the sequence-based msp 
makes use of the information embedded in every sequential 
node pair in the node sequence the polygon boundaries of 
the target nodes obtained in prior could be used to further split 
other target nodes areas our evaluation in sections and 
shows that sequence-based msp considerably enhances system 
accuracy 
 iterative msp 
sequence-based msp is preferable to basic msp because it 
extracts more information from the node sequence in fact 
further useful information still remains in sequence-based msp 
a sequence processed later benefits from information produced 
by previously processed sequences e g the third scan in 
figure however the first several sequences can hardly benefit 
from other scans in this way inspired by this phenomenon 
we propose iterative msp the basic idea of iterative msp is 
to process all the sequences iteratively several times so that the 
processing of each single sequence can benefit from the results 
of other sequences 
to illustrate the idea more clearly figure shows the results 
of three scans that have provided three sequences now if we 
process the sequence a c b obtained from 
scan again we can make progress as shown in figure 
the reprocessing of the node sequence provides information 
in the way an additional vertical scan would from 
sequencebased msp we know that the upper boundaries of nodes and 
 along the scan direction must not extend beyond the upper 
boundary of node therefore the grid parts can be eliminated

figure idea of dbe msp for each node 
for the nodes and node respectively as shown in figure 
from this example we can see that iterative processing of the 
sequence could help further shrink the polygon of each target 
node and thus enhance the accuracy of the system 
the implementation of iterative msp is straightforward 
process all the sequences multiple times using sequence-based 
msp like sequence-based msp iterative msp introduces no 
additional event cost in other words reprocessing does not 
actually repeat the scan physically evaluation results in 
section will show that iterative msp contributes noticeably to 
a lower localization error empirical results show that after 
iterations improvements become less significant in summary 
iterative processing can achieve better performance with only 
a small computation overhead 
 distribution-based estimation 
after determining the location area polygon for each node 
estimation is needed for a final decision previous research 
mostly applied the center of gravity cog method 
 which minimizes average error if every node is 
independent of all others cog is the statistically best solution in 
msp however each node may not be independent for 
example two neighboring nodes in a certain sequence could have 
overlapping polygon areas in this case if the marginal 
probability of joint distribution is used for estimation better 
statistical results are achieved 
figure shows an example in which node and node are 
located in the same polygon if cog is used both nodes are 
localized at the same position figure a however the node 
sequences obtained from two scans indicate that node should 
be to the left of and above node as shown in figure b 
the high-level idea of distribution-based estimation 
proposed for msp which we call dbe msp is illustrated in 
figure the distributions of each node under the ith scan for the 
ith node sequence are estimated in node vmap i which is a 
data structure for remembering the marginal distribution over 
scan i then all the vmaps are combined to get a single map 
and weighted estimation is used to obtain the final location 
for each scan all the nodes are sorted according to the gap 
which is the diameter of the polygon along the direction of the 
scan to produce a second gap-based node sequence then 
the estimation starts from the node with the smallest gap this 
is because it is statistically more accurate to assume a uniform 
distribution of the node with smaller gap for each node 
processed in order from the gap-based node sequence either if 
 
pred node s area 
predecessor node exists 
conditional distribution 
based on pred node s area 
alone uniformly distributed 
succ node s area 
successor node exists 
conditional distribution 
based on succ node s area 
succ node s area 
both predecessor and successor 
nodes exist conditional distribution 
based on both of them 
pred node s area 
figure four cases in dbe process 
no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence 
shares an overlapping area or if the neighbors have not been 
processed due to bigger gaps a uniform distribution uniform 
is applied to this isolated node the alone case in figure 
if the distribution of its neighbors sharing overlapped areas has 
been processed we calculate the joint distribution for the node 
as shown in figure there are three possible cases 
depending on whether the distribution of the overlapping predecessor 
and or successor nodes have has already been estimated 
the estimation s strategy of starting from the most accurate 
node smallest gap node reduces the problem of estimation 
error propagation the results in the evaluation section indicate 
that applying distribution-based estimation could give 
statistically better results 
 adaptive msp 
so far all the enhancements to basic msp focus on 
improving the multi-sequence processing algorithm given a fixed set 
of scan directions all these enhancements require only more 
computing time without any overhead to the sensor nodes 
obviously it is possible to have some choice and optimization on 
how events are generated for example in military situations 
artillery or rocket-launched mini-ultrasound bombs can be used 
for event generation at some selected locations in adaptive 
msp we carefully generate each new localization event so as 
to maximize the contribution of the new event to the refinement 
of localization based on feedback from previous events 
figure depicts the basic architecture of adaptive msp 
through previous localization events the whole map has been 
partitioned into many small location areas the idea of 
adaptive msp is to generate the next localization event to achieve 
best-effort elimination which ideally could shrink the location 
area of individual node as much as possible 
we use a weighted voting mechanism to evaluate candidate 
localization events every node wants the next event to split its 
area evenly which would shrink the area fast therefore every 
node votes for the parameters of the next event e g the scan 
angle k of the straight-line scan since the area map is 
maintained centrally the vote is virtually done and there is no need 
for the real sensor nodes to participate in it after gathering all 
the voting results the event parameters with the most votes win 
the election there are two factors that determine the weight of 
each vote 
 the vote for each candidate event is weighted according 
to the diameter d of the node s location area nodes with 
bigger location areas speak louder in the voting because

overall system error is reduced mostly by splitting the

 the vote for each candidate event is also weighted 
according to its elimination efficiency for a location area which 
is defined as how equally in size or in diameter an event 
can cut an area in other words an optimal scan event 
cuts an area in the middle since this cut shrinks the area 
quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly

we show later that adaptive msp improves localization 
accuracy in wsns with irregularly shaped deployment areas 
 
 overhead and msp complexity analysis 
this section provides a complexity analysis of the msp 
design we emphasize that msp adopts an asymmetric design in 
which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events 
they are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods 
proposed in previous sections in this section we analyze the 
computational cost on the node sequence processing side where 
resources are plentiful 
according to algorithm the computational complexity of 
basic msp is o d Â· n Â· s and the storage space required is 
o n Â· s where d is the number of events n is the number of 
target nodes and s is the area size 
according to algorithm the computational complexity of 
both sequence-based msp and iterative msp is o cÂ·d Â·n Â·s 
where c is the number of iterations and c for 
sequencebased msp and the storage space required is o n Â·s both the 
computational complexity and storage space are equal within a 
constant factor to those of basic msp 
the computational complexity of the distribution-based 
estimation dbe msp is greater the major overhead comes 
from the computation of joint distributions when both 
predecessor and successor nodes exit in order to compute the 
marginal probability msp needs to enumerate the locations of 
the predecessor node and the successor node for example 
if node a has predecessor node b and successor node c then 
the marginal probability pa x y of node a s being at location 
 x y is

being located at m n a naive algorithm to compute equation 
 has complexity o d Â· n Â· s however since the marginal 
probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the

to o d Â· n Â· s after algorithm optimization in addition the 
final location areas for every node are much smaller than the 
original field s therefore in practice dbe msp can be 
computed much faster than o d Â·n Â·s 
 wave propagation example 
so far the description of msp has been solely in the 
context of straight-line scan however we note that msp is 
conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long 
as node sequences can be obtained clearly we can also 
support wave-propagation-based events e g ultrasound 
propagation air blast propagation which are polar coordinate 
equivalences of the line scans in the cartesian coordinate system 
this section illustrates the effects of msp s implementation in 
the wave propagation-based situation for easy modelling we 
have made the following assumptions 
 the wave propagates uniformly in all directions 
therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface since 
msp does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship 
a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable if any 
directional wave is used the propagation frontier surface 
can be modified accordingly

figure example of wave propagation situation 
 under the situation of line-of-sight we allow obstacles to 
reflect or deflect the wave reflection and deflection are 
not problems because each node reacts only to the first 
detected event those reflected or deflected waves come 
later than the line-of-sight waves the only thing the 
system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval 
between two successive localization events 
 we assume that background noise exists and therefore we 
run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave 
frequency this reduces the chances of false detection 
the parameter that affects the localization event generation 
here is the source location of the event the different 
distances between each node and the event source determine the 
rank of each node in the node sequence using the node 
sequences the msp algorithm divides the whole area into many 
non-rectangular areas as shown in figure in this figure 
the stars represent two previous event sources the previous 
two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those 
dashed circles that pass one of the anchors each node is 
located in one of the small areas since sequence-based msp 
iterative msp and dbe msp make no assumptions about the 
type of localization events and the shape of the area all three 
optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave 
propagation scenario 
however adaptive msp needs more explanation figure 
illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source 
locations unlike the straight-line scan the critical parameter 
now is the location of the event source because the distance 
between each node and the event source determines the rank of 
the node in the sequence in figure if the next event breaks 
out along near the solid thick gray line which perpendicularly 
bisects the solid dark line between anchor c and the center of 
gravity of node s area the gray area the wave would reach 
anchor c and the center of gravity of node s area at roughly 
the same time which would relatively equally divide node s 
area therefore node prefers to vote for the positions around 
the thick gray line 
 practical deployment issues 
for the sake of presentation until now we have described 
msp in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be 
obtained with accurate time synchronization in this section 
we describe how to make msp work well under more realistic 
conditions 
 
 incomplete node sequence 
for diverse reasons such as sensor malfunction or natural 
obstacles the nodes in the network could fail to detect 
localization events in such cases the node sequence will not be 
complete this problem has two versions 
 anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence 
if some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization 
events then the system has fewer anchors in this case 
the solution is to generate more events to compensate for 
the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy 
requirements 
 target nodes are missing in the node sequence 
there are two consequences when target nodes are 
missing first if these nodes are still be useful to sensing 
applications they need to use other backup localization 
approaches e g centroid to localize themselves with help 
from their neighbors who have already learned their own 
locations from msp secondly since in advanced msp 
each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall 
system accuracy dropping of target nodes from sequences 
could also reduce the accuracy of the localization thus 
proper compensation procedures such as adding more 
localization events need to be launched 
 localization without time synchronization 
in a sensor network without time synchronization support 
nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps for 
such cases we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report 
protocol which is able to function independently without time 
synchronization 
listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node 
listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its 
neighbors then when the node detects the localization event 
it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard 
and reports the updated sequence to other nodes figure 
 a illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report 
protocol for simplicity in this figure we did not differentiate 
the target nodes from anchor nodes a solid line between two 
nodes stands for a communication link suppose a straight line 
scans from left to right node detects the event and then it 
broadcasts the sequence into the network node and node 
 receive this sequence when node detects the event node 
 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts the 
sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown 
in figure a finally node obtains a complete sequence 
 
in the case of ultrasound propagation because the event 
propagation speed is much slower than that of radio the 
listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation 
where the node density is not very high for instance if the 
distance between two nodes along one direction is meters 
the m s sound needs ms to propagate from one node 
to the other while normally the communication data rate is 
 kbps in the wsn e g cc it takes only about 
 âˆ¼ ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop 
one problem that may occur using the 
listen-detectassemble-report protocol is multiple partial sequences as 
shown in figure b two separate paths in the network may 
result in two sequences that could not be further combined in 
this case since the two sequences can only be processed as 
separate sequences some order information is lost therefore the

accuracy of the system would decrease 
the other problem is the sequence flip problem as shown 
in figure c because node and node are too close to 
each other along the scan direction they detect the scan 
almost simultaneously due to the uncertainty such as media 
access delay two messages could be transmitted out of order 
for example if node sends out its report first then the order 
of node and node gets flipped in the final node sequence 
the sequence flip problem would appear even in an accurately 
synchronized system due to random jitter in node detection if 
an event arrives at multiple nodes almost simultaneously a 
method addressing the sequence flip is presented in the next 
section 
 sequence flip and protection band 
sequence flip problems can be solved with and without 
time synchronization we firstly start with a scenario 
applying time synchronization existing solutions for time 
synchronization can easily achieve sub-millisecond-level 
accuracy for example ftsp achieves Âµs microsecond 
average error for a two-node single-hop case therefore we 
can comfortably assume that the network is synchronized with 
maximum error of Âµs however when multiple nodes are 
located very near to each other along the event propagation 
direction even when time synchronization with less than ms 
error is achieved in the network sequence flip may still occur 
for example in the sound wave propagation case if two nodes 
are less than meters apart the difference between their 
detection timestamp would be smaller than millisecond 
we find that sequence flip could not only damage system 
accuracy but also might cause a fatal error in the msp algorithm 
figure illustrates both detrimental results in the left side of 
figure a suppose node and node are so close to each 
other that it takes less than ms for the localization event to 
propagate from node to node now unfortunately the node 
sequence is mistaken to be so node is expected to be 
located to the right of node such as at the position of the 
dashed node according to the elimination rule in 
sequencebased msp the left part of node s area is cut off as shown in 
the right part of figure a this is a potentially fatal error 
because node is actually located in the dashed area which has 
been eliminated by mistake during the subsequent 
eliminations introduced by other events node s area might be cut off 
completely thus node could consequently be erased from the 
map even in cases where node still survives its area actually 
does not cover its real location

figure sequence flip and protection band 
another problem is not fatal but lowers the localization 
accuracy if we get the right node sequence node has a 
new upper boundary which can narrow the area of node as in 
figure due to the sequence flip node loses this new upper 
boundary 
in order to address the sequence flip problem especially to 
prevent nodes from being erased from the map we propose 
a protection band compensation approach the basic idea of 
protection band is to extend the boundary of the location area 
a little bit so as to make sure that the node will never be erased 
from the map this solution is based on the fact that nodes 
have a high probability of flipping in the sequence if they are 
near to each other along the event propagation direction if 
two nodes are apart from each other more than some distance 
say b they rarely flip unless the nodes are faulty the width 
of a protection band b is largely determined by the maximum 
error in system time synchronization and the localization event 
propagation speed 
figure b presents the application of the protection band 
instead of eliminating the dashed part in figure a for node 
 the new lower boundary of node is set by shifting the 
original lower boundary of node to the left by distance b in this 
case the location area still covers node and protects it from 
being erased in a practical implementation supposing that the 
ultrasound event is used if the maximum error of system time 
synchronization is ms two nodes might flip with high 
probability if the timestamp difference between the two nodes is 
smaller than or equal to ms accordingly we set the 
protection band b as m the distance sound can propagate within 
 millisecond by adding the protection band we reduce the 
chances of fatal errors although at the cost of localization 
accuracy empirical results obtained from our physical test-bed 
verified this conclusion 
in the case of using the listen-detect-assemble-report 
protocol the only change we need to make is to select the protection 
band according to the maximum delay uncertainty introduced 
by the mac operation and the event propagation speed to 
bound mac delay at the node side a node can drop its report 
message if it experiences excessive mac delay this converts 
the sequence flip problem to the incomplete sequence problem 
which can be more easily addressed by the method proposed in 
section 
 simulation evaluation 
our evaluation of msp was conducted on three platforms 
 i an indoor system with micaz motes using straight-line 
scan ii an outdoor system with micaz motes using sound 
wave propagation and iii an extensive simulation under 
various kinds of physical settings 
in order to understand the behavior of msp under 
numerous settings we start our evaluation with simulations 
then we implemented basic msp and all the advanced 
msp methods for the case where time synchronization is 
available in the network the simulation and 
implementation details are omitted in this paper due to space 
constraints but related documents are provided online at 
http www cs umn edu âˆ¼zhong msp full implementation and 
evaluation of system without time synchronization are yet to be 
completed in the near future 
in simulation we assume all the node sequences are perfect 
so as to reveal the performance of msp achievable in the 
absence of incomplete node sequences or sequence flips in our 
simulations all the anchor nodes and target nodes are assumed 
to be deployed uniformly the mean and maximum errors are 
averaged over runs to obtain high confidence for legibility 
reasons we do not plot the confidence intervals in this paper 
all the simulations are based on the straight-line scan example 
we implement three scan strategies 
 random scan the slope of the scan line is randomly 
chosen at each time 
 regular scan the slope is predetermined to rotate 
uniformly from degree to degrees for example if the 
system scans times then the scan angles would be 
 and 
 adaptive scan the slope of each scan is determined 
based on the localization results from previous scans 
we start with basic msp and then demonstrate the 
performance improvements one step at a time by adding i 
sequencebased msp ii iterative msp iii dbe msp and iv adaptive 
msp 
 performance of basic msp 
the evaluation starts with basic msp where we compare the 
performance of random scan and regular scan under different 
configurations we intend to illustrate the impact of the number 
of anchors m the number of scans d and target node density 
 number of target nodes n in a fixed-size region on the 
localization error table shows the default simulation parameters 
the error of each node is defined as the distance between the 
estimated location and the real position we note that by 
default we only use three anchors which is considerably fewer 
than existing range-free solutions 
impact of the number of scans in this experiment we 
compare regular scan with random scan under a different number 
of scans from to in steps of the number of anchors

figure improvements of sequence-based msp over basic msp 
is by default figure a indicates the following i as 
the number of scans increases the localization error decreases 
significantly for example localization errors drop more than 
 from scans to scans ii statistically regular scan 
achieves better performance than random scan under identical 
number of scans however the performance gap reduces as 
the number of scans increases this is expected since a large 
number of random numbers converges to a uniform 
distribution figure a also demonstrates that msp requires only 
a small number of anchors to perform very well compared to 
existing range-free solutions 
impact of the number of anchors in this experiment we 
compare regular scan with random scan under different 
number of anchors from to in steps of the results shown in 
figure b indicate that i as the number of anchor nodes 
increases the localization error decreases and ii 
statistically regular scan obtains better results than random scan with 
identical number of anchors by combining figures a 
and b we can conclude that msp allows a flexible tradeoff 
between physical cost anchor nodes and soft cost 
 localization events 
impact of the target node density in this experiment we 
confirm that the density of target nodes has no impact on the 
accuracy which motivated the design of sequence-based msp 
in this experiment we compare regular scan with random scan 
under different number of target nodes from to in steps 
of results in figure c show that mean localization 
errors remain constant across different node densities however 
when the number of target nodes increases the average 
maximum error increases 
summary from the above experiments we can conclude that 
in basic msp regular scan are better than random scan under 
different numbers of anchors and scan events this is because 
regular scans uniformly eliminate the map from different 
directions while random scans would obtain sequences with 
redundant overlapping information if two scans choose two similar 
scanning slopes 
 improvements of sequence-based msp 
this section evaluates the benefits of exploiting the order 
information among target nodes by comparing sequence-based 
msp with basic msp in this and the following sections 
regular scan is used for straight-line scan event generation the 
purpose of using regular scan is to keep the scan events and 
the node sequences identical for both sequence-based msp and 
basic msp so that the only difference between them is the 
sequence processing procedure 
impact of the number of scans in this experiment we 
compare sequence-based msp with basic msp under different 
number of scans from to in steps of figure a 
indicates significant performance improvement in sequence-based 
msp over basic msp across all scan settings especially when 
the number of scans is large for example when the number 
of scans is errors in sequence-based msp are about 
of that of basic msp we conclude that sequence-based msp 
performs extremely well when there are many scan events 
impact of the number of anchors in this experiment we 
use different number of anchors from to in steps of as 
seen in figure b the mean error and maximum error of 
sequence-based msp is much smaller than that of basic msp 
especially when there is limited number of anchors in the 
system e g anchors the error rate was almost halved by 
using sequence-based msp this phenomenon has an interesting 
explanation the cutting lines created by anchor nodes are 
exploited by both basic msp and sequence-based msp so as the

figure the improvements of adaptive msp 
number of anchor nodes increases anchors tend to dominate 
the contribution therefore the performance gaps lessens 
impact of the target node density figure c 
demonstrates the benefits of exploiting order information among 
target nodes since sequence-based msp makes use of the 
information among the target nodes having more target nodes 
contributes to the overall system accuracy as the number of 
target nodes increases the mean error and maximum error of 
sequence-based msp decreases clearly the mean error in 
basic msp is not affected by the number of target nodes as shown 
in figure c 
summary from the above experiments we can conclude that 
exploiting order information among target nodes can improve 
accuracy significantly especially when the number of events is 
large but with few anchors 
 iterative msp over sequence-based msp 
in this experiment the same node sequences were processed 
iteratively multiple times in figure the two single marks 
are results from basic msp since basic msp doesn t perform 
iterations the two curves present the performance of 
iterative msp under different numbers of iterations c we note that 
when only a single iteration is used this method degrades to 
sequence-based msp therefore figure compares the three 
methods to one another 
figure shows that the second iteration can reduce the 
mean error and maximum error dramatically after that the 
performance gain gradually reduces especially when c 
this is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to 
exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first 
iteration such exploitation decays quickly over iterations 
 dbe msp over iterative msp 
figure in which we augment iterative msp with 
distribution-based estimation dbe msp shows that dbe 
msp could bring about statistically better performance 
figure presents cumulative distribution localization errors in 
general the two curves of the dbe msp lay slightly to the left 
of that of non-dbe msp which indicates that dbe msp has 
a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error 
than non-dbe msp we note that because dbe is augmented 
on top of the best solution so far the performance 
improvement is not significant when we apply dbe on basic msp 
methods the improvement is much more significant we omit 
these results because of space constraints 
 improvements of adaptive msp 
this section illustrates the performance of adaptive msp 
over non-adaptive msp we note that feedback-based 
adaptation can be applied to all msp methods since it affects only 
the scanning angles but not the sequence processing in this 
experiment we evaluated how adaptive msp can improve the 
best solution so far the default angle granularity step for 
adaptive searching is degrees 
impact of area shape first if system settings are regular 
the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results for a 
square area regular the performance of adaptive msp and 
regular scans are very close however if the shape of the area 
is not regular adaptive msp helps to choose the appropriate 
localization events to compensate therefore adaptive msp 
can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown 
in figure a for example adaptive msp improves 
localization accuracy by when the number of target nodes is 
 
impact of the target node density figure a shows that 
when the node density is low adaptive msp brings more 
benefit than when node density is high this phenomenon makes 
statistical sense because the law of large numbers tells us that 
node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when 
the number of nodes is increased adaptive msp has an edge 
 
figure the mirage test-bed line scan figure the -node outdoor experiments wave 
when layout is not uniform 
impact of candidate angle density figure b shows that 
the smaller the candidate scan angle step the better the 
statistical performance in terms of mean error the rationale is clear 
as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive msp more 
opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle 
 simulation summary 
starting from basic msp we have demonstrated 
step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other 
to improve localization performance in other words these 
optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly 
improve the overall performance we note that our simulations 
were done under assumption that the complete node sequence 
can be obtained without sequence flips in the next section we 
present two real-system implementations that reveal and 
address these practical issues 
 system evaluation 
in this section we present a system implementation of msp 
on two physical test-beds the first one is called mirage a 
large indoor test-bed composed of six -foot by -foot boards 
illustrated in figure each board in the system can be used 
as an individual sub-system which is powered controlled and 
metered separately three hitachi cp-x projectors 
connected through a matorx triplehead go graphics expansion 
box are used to create an ultra-wide integrated display on six 
boards figure shows that a long tilted line is generated by 
the projectors we have implemented all five versions of msp 
on the mirage test-bed running micaz motes unless 
mentioned otherwise the default setting is anchors and scans at 
the scanning line speed of feet s in all of our graphs each 
data point represents the average value of trials in the 
outdoor system a dell a speaker is used to generate khz 
sound as shown in figure we place micaz motes in the 
backyard of a house since the location is not completely open 
sound waves are reflected scattered and absorbed by various 
objects in the vicinity causing a multi-path effect in the 
system evaluation simple time synchronization mechanisms are 
applied on each node 
 indoor system evaluation 
during indoor experiments we encountered several 
realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation first 
sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and 
message losses second elements in the sequences could flip due 
to detection delay uncertainty in media access or error in time 
synchronization we show that these issues can be addressed 
by using the protection band method described in section 
 on scanning speed and protection band 
in this experiment we studied the impact of the scanning 
speed and the length of protection band on the performance of 
the system in general with increasing scanning speed nodes 
have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between 
two adjacent nodes shrinks leading to an increasing number of 
partial sequences and sequence flips 
figure shows the node flip situations for six scans with 
distinct angles under different scan speeds the x-axis shows 
the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node 
sequence y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans 
this figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only 
increasing number of flips but also longer-distance flips that require 
wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors 
figure a shows the effectiveness of the protection band 
in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes when 
we use a moderate scan speed feet s the chance of flipping 
is rare therefore we can achieve feet mean accuracy 
 figure b with feet maximum error figure c with 
increasing speeds the protection band needs to be set to a larger 
value to deal with flipping interesting phenomena can be 
observed in figures on one hand the protection band can 
sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes on the other 
hand protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would 
potentially reside introducing more uncertainty thus there is 
a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the 
scan speed is at feet s 
 on msp methods and protection band 
in this experiment we show the improvements resulting 
from three different methods figure a shows that a 
protection band of feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 
 feet s figures b and c show clearly that iterative 
msp with adaptation achieves best performance for 
example figures b shows that when we set the protection band 
at feet iterative msp achieves feet accuracy which 
is more accurate than the basic design similarly 
figures b and c show the double-edged effects of 
protection band on the localization accuracy

in this experiment we show a tradeoff between hardware 
cost anchors with soft cost events figure a shows that 
with more cutting lines created by anchors the chance of 
unlocalized nodes increases slightly we note that with a feet 
protection band the percentage of unlocalized nodes is very 
small e g in the worst-case with anchors only out of 
nodes are not localized due to flipping figures b and c 
show the tradeoff between number of anchors and the number 
of scans obviously with the number of anchors increases the 
error drops significantly with anchors we can achieve a 
localization accuracy as low as âˆ¼ feet which is nearly a 
 improvement similarly with increasing number of scans 
the accuracy drops significantly as well we can observe about 
 across all anchor settings when we increase the number of 
scans from to for example with only anchors we can 
achieve -foot accuracy with scans 
 outdoor system evaluation 
the outdoor system evaluation contains two parts i 
effective detection distance evaluation which shows that the 
node sequence can be readily obtained and ii sound 
propagation based localization which shows the results of 
wavepropagation-based localization 
 effective detection distance evaluation 
we firstly evaluate the sequence flip phenomenon in wave 
propagation as shown in figure motes were placed as 
five groups in front of the speaker four nodes in each group 
at roughly the same distances to the speaker the gap between 
each group is set to be and feet respectively in four 
experiments figure shows the results the x-axis in each 
subgraph indicates the group index there are four nodes in each 
group bars the y-axis shows the detection rank order 
of each node in the node sequence as distance between each 
group increases number of flips in the resulting node sequence

figure localization error sound 
decreases for example in the -foot distance subgraph there 
are quite a few flips between nodes in adjacent and even 
nonadjacent groups while in the -foot subgraph flips between 
different groups disappeared in the test 
 sound propagation based localization 
as shown in figure motes are placed as a grid 
including rows with feet between each row and columns with 
 feet between each column six khz acoustic wave 
propagation events are generated around the mote grid by a speaker 
figure shows the localization results using iterative msp 
 times iterative processing with a protection band of feet 
the average error of the localization results is feet and the 
maximum error is feet with one un-localized node 
we found that sequence flip in wave propagation is more 
severe than that in the indoor line-based test this is expected 
due to the high propagation speed of sound currently we use 
micaz mote which is equipped with a low quality 
microphone we believe that using a better speaker and more events 
the system can yield better accuracy despite the hardware 
constrains the msp algorithm still successfully localized most of 
the nodes with good accuracy 
 conclusions 
in this paper we present the first work that exploits the 
concept of node sequence processing to localize sensor nodes we 
demonstrated that we could significantly improve localization 
accuracy by making full use of the information embedded in 
multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences we 
proposed four novel optimization methods exploiting order and 
marginal distribution among non-anchor nodes as well as the 
feedback information from early localization results 
importantly these optimization methods can be used together and 
improve accuracy additively the practical issues of partial 
node sequence and sequence flip were identified and addressed 
in two physical system test-beds we also evaluated 
performance at scale through analysis as well as extensive 
simulations results demonstrate that requiring neither costly 
hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution msp can 
achieve a sub-foot accuracy with very few anchor nodes 
provided sufficient events
