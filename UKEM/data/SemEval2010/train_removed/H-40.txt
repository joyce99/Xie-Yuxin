abstract 
query suggestion aims to suggest relevant queries for a given 
query which help users better specify their information needs 
previously the suggested terms are mostly in the same language 
of the input query in this paper we extend it to cross-lingual 
query suggestion clqs for a query in one language we suggest 
similar or relevant queries in other languages this is very 
important to scenarios of cross-language information retrieval 
 clir and cross-lingual keyword bidding for search engine 
advertisement instead of relying on existing query translation 
technologies for clqs we present an effective means to map the 
input query of one language to queries of the other language in the 
query log important monolingual and cross-lingual information 
such as word translation relations and word co-occurrence 
statistics etc are used to estimate the cross-lingual query 
similarity with a discriminative model benchmarks show that the 
resulting clqs system significantly outperforms a baseline 
system based on dictionary-based query translation besides the 
resulting clqs is tested with french to english clir tasks on 
trec collections the results demonstrate higher effectiveness 
than the traditional query translation methods

 introduction 
query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search 
engine to better specify their information need by narrowing 
down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous 
queries and relevant queries or by suggesting related queries that 
have been frequently used by other users search engines such as 
google yahoo msn ask jeeves all have implemented query 
suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search 
method in addition the same technology has been leveraged to 
recommend bidding terms to online advertiser in the 
pay-forperformance search market 
query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which 
extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the 
scope of the search but different from query expansion query 
suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated 
by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in 
the suggested queries 
typical methods for query suggestion exploit query logs and 
document collections by assuming that in the same period of 
time many users share the same or similar interests which can be 
expressed in different manners by suggesting the 
related and frequently used formulations it is hoped that the new 
query can cover more relevant documents however all of the 
existing studies dealt with monolingual query suggestion and to 
our knowledge there is no published study on cross-lingual query 
suggestion clqs clqs aims to suggest related queries but in a 
different language it has wide applications on world wide web 
for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms 
in a different language 
clqs can be approached as a query translation problem i e to 
suggest the queries that are translations of the original query 
dictionaries large size of parallel corpora and existing 
commercial machine translation systems can be used for 
translation however these kinds of approaches usually rely on 
static knowledge and data it cannot effectively reflect the quickly 
shifting interests of web users moreover there are some 
problems with translated queries in target language for instance 
the translated terms can be reasonable translations but they are 
not popularly used in the target language for example the french 
query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by 
google translation tool 
 yet the correct formulation nowadays 
should be organic food therefore there exist many mismatch 
cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in 
target language this mismatch makes the suggested terms in the 
target language ineffective 
a natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the 
queries in the source language and the queries in the target 
language by using the query log of a search engine we exploit 
the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time 
have similar interests and they submit queries on similar topics in 
different languages as a result a query written in a source 
language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target 
language in particular if the user intends to perform clir then 
original query is even more likely to have its correspondent 
included in the target language query log therefore if a 
candidate for clqs appears often in the query log then it is more 
likely the appropriate one to be suggested 
in this paper we propose a method of calculating the similarity 
between source language query and the target language query by 
exploiting in addition to the translation information a wide 
spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information such as term 
co-occurrences query logs with click-through data etc a 
discriminative model is used to learn the cross-lingual query 
similarity based on a set of manually translated queries the 
model is trained by optimizing the cross-lingual similarity to best 
fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other 
query s translation besides being benchmarked as an independent 
module the resulting clqs system is tested as a new means of 
query translation in clir task on trec collections the results 
show that this new translation method is more effective than the 
traditional query translation method 
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 
introduces the related work section describes in detail the 
discriminative model for estimating cross-lingual query similarity 
section presents a new clir approach using cross-lingual query 
suggestion as a bridge across language boundaries section 
discusses the experiments and benchmarks finally the paper is 
concluded in section 
 related work 
most approaches to clir perform a query translation followed by 
a monolingual ir typically queries are translated either using a 
bilingual dictionary a machine translation software or a 
parallel corpus 
despite the various types of resources used out-of-vocabulary 
 oov words and translation disambiguation are the two major 
bottlenecks for clir in oov term translations are 
mined from the web using a search engine in bilingual 
knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis in addition 
word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been 
leveraged for translation disambiguation 
 
http www google com language tools 
nevertheless it is arguable that accurate query translation may 
not be necessary for clir indeed in many cases it is helpful to 
introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any 
query word but are closely related to the meaning of the query 
this observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query 
expansion clqe techniques reports the 
enhancement on clir by post-translation expansion 
develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the 
crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts makes 
performance comparison on multiple clqe techniques including 
pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion 
however there is lack of a unified framework to combine the 
wide spectrum of resources and recent advances of mining 
techniques for clqe 
clqs is different from clqe in that it aims to suggest full 
queries that have been formulated by users in another language 
as clqs exploits up-to-date query logs it is expected that for 
most user queries we can find common formulations on these 
topics in the query log in the target language therefore clqs 
also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the 
common formulations of similar topics in the target language 
query logs have been successfully used for monolingual ir 
 especially in monolingual query suggestions and 
relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion 
 in the target language query log has been exploited to 
help query translation in clir 
 estimating cross-lingual 
query similarity 
a search engine has a query log containing user queries in 
different languages within a certain period of time in addition to 
query terms click-through information is also recorded therefore 
we know which documents have been selected by users for each 
query given a query in the source language our clqs task is to 
determine one or several similar queries in the target language 
from the query log 
the key problem with cross-lingual query suggestion is how to 
learn a similarity measure between two queries in different 
languages although various statistical similarity measures have 
been studied for monolingual terms most of them are 
based on term co-occurrence statistics and can hardly be applied 
directly in cross-lingual settings 
in order to define a similarity measure across languages one 
has to use at least one translation tool or resource so the measure 
is based on both translation relation and monolingual similarity in 
this paper as our purpose is to provide up-to-date query similarity 
measure it may not be sufficient to use only a static translation 
resource therefore we also integrate a method to mine possible 
translations on the web this method is particularly useful for 
dealing with oov terms 
given a set of resources of different natures the next question 
is how to integrate them in a principled manner in this paper we 
propose a discriminative model to learn the appropriate similarity 
measure the principle is as follows we assume that we have a 
reasonable monolingual query similarity measure for any training 
query example for which a translation exists its similarity 
measure with any other query is transposed to its translation 
therefore we have the desired cross-language similarity value for 
this example then we use a discriminative model to learn the 
cross-language similarity function which fits the best these 
examples 
in the following sections let us first describe the detail of the 
discriminative model for cross-lingual query similarity estimation 
then we introduce all the features monolingual and cross-lingual 
information that we will use in the discriminative model 
 discriminative model for estimating 
cross-lingual query similarity 
in this section we propose a discriminative model to learn 
crosslingual query similarities in a principled manner the principle is 
as follows for a reasonable monolingual query similarity between 
two queries a cross-lingual correspondent can be deduced 
between one query and another query s translation in other 
words for a pair of queries in different languages their 
crosslingual similarity should fit the monolingual similarity between 
one query and the other query s translation for example the 
similarity between french query pages jaunes i e yellow 
page in english and english query telephone directory should 
be equal to the monolingual similarity between the translation of 
the french query yellow page and telephone directory there 
are many ways to obtain a monolingual similarity measure 
between terms e g term co-occurrence based mutual information 
and 
χ any of them can be used as the target for the cross-lingual 
similarity function to fit in this way cross-lingual query 
similarity estimation is formulated as a regression task as follows 
given a source language query fq a target language query eq 
and a monolingual query similarity mlsim the corresponding 
cross-lingual query similarity clsim is defined as follows 
 eqmlefcl qtsimqqsim f 
 
where fqt is the translation of fq in the target language 
based on equation it would be relatively easy to create a 
training corpus all it requires is a list of query translations then 
an existing monolingual query suggestion system can be used to 
automatically produce similar query to each translation and create 
the training corpus for cross-lingual similarity estimation another 
advantage is that it is fairly easy to make use of arbitrary 
information sources within a discriminative modeling framework 
to achieve optimal performance 
in this paper support vector machine svm regression 
algorithm is used to learn the cross-lingual term similarity 
function given a vector of feature functions f between fq and 
eq efcl ttsim is represented as an inner product between a 
weight vector and the feature vector in a kernel space as follows 
 efefcl ttfwttsim φ 
where φ is the mapping from the input feature space onto the 
kernel space and wis the weight vector in the kernel space which 
will be learned by the svm regression training once the weight 
vector is learned the equation can be used to estimate the 
similarity between queries of different languages 
we want to point out that instead of regression one can 
definitely simplify the task as a binary or ordinal classification in 
which case clqs can be categorized according to discontinuous 
class labels e g relevant and irrelevant or a series of levels of 
relevancies e g strongly relevant weakly relevant and 
irrelevant in either case one can resort to discriminative 
classification approaches such as an svm or maximum entropy 
model in a straightforward way however the regression 
formalism enables us to fully rank the suggested queries based on 
the similarity score given by equation 
the equations and construct a regression model for 
cross-lingual query similarity estimation in the following 
sections the monolingual query similarity measure see section 
 and the feature functions used for svm regression see 
section will be presented 
 monolingual query similarity measure 
based on click-through information 
any monolingual term similarity measure can be used as the 
regression target in this paper we select the monolingual query 
similarity measure presented in which reports good 
performance by using search users click-through information in 
query logs the reason to choose this monolingual similarity is 
that it is defined in a similar context as ours − according to a user 
log that reflects users intention and behavior therefore we can 
expect that the cross-language term similarity learned from it can 
also reflect users intention and expectation 
following our monolingual query similarity is defined by 
combining both query content-based similarity and click-through 
commonality in the query log 
first the content similarity between two queries p and q is 
defined as follows 
 
 
 
qknpknmax 
qpkn 
qpsimilarity content 
where xkn is the number of keywords in a query x qpkn is 
the number of common keywords in the two queries 
secondly the click-through based similarity is defined as 
follows 
 
 
 
qrdprdmax 
qprd 
qpsimilarity throughclick − 
 
where xrd is the number of clicked urls for a query x and 
 qprd is the number of common urls clicked for two queries 
finally the similarity between two queries is a linear 
combination of the content-based and click-through-based 
similarities and is presented as follows 
 
 
qpsimilarity 
qpsimilarityqpsimilarity 
throughclick 
content

β 
α 
where α and β are the relative importance of the two similarity 
measures in this paper we set α and β following the 
practice in queries with similarity measure higher than a 
threshold with another query will be regarded as relevant 
monolingual query suggestions mlqs for the latter in this 
paper the threshold is set as empirically 
 features used for learning cross-lingual 
query similarity measure 
this section presents the extraction of candidate relevant queries 
from the log with the assistance of various monolingual and 
bilingual resources meanwhile feature functions over source 
query and the cross-lingual relevant candidates are defined some 
of the resources being used here such as bilingual lexicon and 
parallel corpora were for query translation in previous work but 
note that we employ them here as an assistant means for finding 
relevant candidates in the log rather than for acquiring accurate 
translations 
 bilingual dictionary 
in this subsection a built-in-house bilingual dictionary containing 
 unique entries is used to retrieve candidate queries since 
multiple translations may be associated with each source word 
co-occurrence based translation disambiguation is performed 
 the process is presented as follows 
given an input query fnfff wwwq k in the source 
language for each query term fiw a set of unique translations are 
provided by the bilingual dictionary d imiifi tttwd k 
then the cohesion between the translations of two query terms is 
measured using mutual information which is computed as follows

here yxc is the number of queries in the log containing both 
x and y xc is the number of queries containing term x and 
n is the total number of queries in the log 
based on the term-term cohesion defined in equation all the 
possible query translations are ranked using the summation of the 
term-term cohesion ∑≠ 
 
kiki 
klijqdict ttmits f 
 
 the set of 
top- query translations is denoted as fqts for each possible 
query translation fqtst∈ we retrieve all the queries containing 
the same keywords as t from the target language log the 
retrieved queries are candidate target queries and are assigned 
 tsdict 
as the value of the feature dictionary-based translation 
score 
 parallel corpora 
parallel corpora are precious resources for bilingual knowledge 
acquisition different from the bilingual dictionary the bilingual 
knowledge learned from parallel corpora assigns probability for 
each translation candidate which is useful in acquiring dominant 
query translations 
in this paper the europarl corpus a set of parallel french and 
english texts from the proceedings of the european parliament is 
used the corpus is first sentence aligned then word alignments 
are derived by training an ibm translation model using 
giza the learned bilingual knowledge is used to extract 
candidate queries from the query log the process is presented as 
follows 
given a pair of queries fq in the source language and eq in the 
target language the bi-directional translation score is defined as 
follows 
 feibmefibmefibm qqpqqpqqs 
where xypibm 
is the word sequence translation probability 
given by ibm model which has the following form 
∏∑ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
y 
j 
x 
i 
ijyibm xyp 
x 
xyp 
where ij xyp is the word to word translation probability 
derived from the word-aligned corpora 
the reason to use bidirectional translation probability is to deal 
with the fact that common words can be considered as possible 
translations of many words by using bidirectional translation we 
test whether the translation words can be translated back to the 
source words this is helpful to focus on the translation 
probability onto the most specific translation candidates 
now given an input query fq the top queries eq with the 
highest bidirectional translation scores with fq are retrieved from 
the query log and efibm qqs in equation is assigned as the 
value for the feature bi-directional translation score 
 online mining for related queries 
oov word translation is a major knowledge bottleneck for query 
translation and clir to overcome this knowledge bottleneck 
web mining has been exploited in to acquire 
englishchinese term translations based on the observation that chinese 
terms may co-occur with their english translations in the same 
web page in this section this web mining approach is adapted to 
acquire not only translations but semantically related queries in 
the target language 
it is assumed that if a query in the target language co-occurs 
with the source query in many web pages they are probably 
semantically related therefore a simple method is to send the 
source query to a search engine google in our case for web 
pages in the target language in order to find related queries in the 
target language for instance by sending a french query pages 
jaunes to search for english pages the english snippets 
containing the key words yellow pages or telephone directory 
will be returned however this simple approach may induce 
significant amount of noise due to the non-relevant returns from 
the search engine in order to improve the relevancy of the 
bilingual snippets we extend the simple approach by the 
following query modification the original query is used to search 
with the dictionary-based query keyword translations which are 
unified by the ∧ and ∨ or operators into a single boolean 
query for example for a given query abcq where the set of 
translation entries in the dictionary of for a is aaa b is 
 bb and c is c we issue cbbaaaq ∧∨∧∨∨∧ as 
one web query 
from the returned top snippets the most frequent target 
queries are identified and are associated with the feature 
frequency in the snippets 
furthermore we use co-occurrence double-check codc 
measure to weight the association between the source and target 
queries codc measure is proposed in as an association 
measure based on snippet analysis named web search with 
double checking wsdc model in wsdc model two objects a 
and b are considered to have an association if b can be found by 
using a as query forward process and a can be found by using b 
as query backward process by web search the forward process 
counts the frequency of b in the top n snippets of query a denoted 
as   abfreq similarly the backward process count the 
frequency of a in the top n snippets of query b denoted 
as   bafreq then the codc association score is defined as 
follows

our experiment α is set at following the practice in 
any query eq mined from the web will be associated with a

 monolingual query suggestion 
for all the candidate queries q being retrieved using dictionary 
 see section parallel data see section and web 
mining see section monolingual query suggestion system 
 described in section is called to produce more related 
queries in the target language for each target query eq its 
monolingual source query eml qsq is defined as the query in 
 q with the highest monolingual similarity with eq i e 
 maxarg eemlqqeml qqsimqsq e 
′ ∈′ 
 
then the monolingual similarity between eq and eml qsq is 
used as the value of the eq s monolingual query suggestion 
feature for any target query qq∈ its monolingual query 
suggestion feature is set as 
for any query qqe ∉ its values of dictionary-based 
translation score bi-directional translation score frequency 
in the snippet and codc measure are set to be equal to the 
feature values of eml qsq 
 estimating cross-lingual query similarity 
in summary four categories of features are used to learn the 
crosslingual query similarity svm regression algorithm is used to 
learn the weights in equation in this paper libsvm toolkit 
 is used for the regression training 
in the prediction stage the candidate queries will be ranked 
using the cross-lingual query similarity score computed in terms 
of efefcl ttfwttsim φ and the queries with 
similarity score lower than a threshold will be regarded as 
nonrelevant the threshold is learned using a development data set by 
fitting mlqs s output 
 clir based on cross-lingual 
query suggestion 
in section we presented a discriminative model for cross lingual 
query suggestion however objectively benchmarking a query 
suggestion system is not a trivial task in this paper we propose to 
use clqs as an alternative to query translation and test its 
effectiveness in clir tasks the resulting good performance of 
clir corresponds to the high quality of the suggested queries 
given a source query fq a set of relevant queries eq in the 
target language are recommended using the cross-lingual query 
suggestion system then a monolingual ir system based on the 
bm model is called using each eqq∈ as queries to 
retrieve documents then the retrieved documents are re-ranked 
based on the sum of the bm scores associated with each 
monolingual retrieval 
 performacnce evaluation 
in this section we will benchmark the cross-lingual query 
suggestion system comparing its performance with monolingual 
query suggestion studying the contribution of various information 
sources and testing its effectiveness when being used in clir 
tasks 
 data resources 
in our experiments french and english are selected as the source 
and target language respectively such selection is due to the fact 
that large scale query logs are readily available for these two 
languages a one-month english query log containing million 
unique english queries with occurrence frequency more than of 
msn search engine is used as the target language log and a 
monolingual query suggestion system is built based on it in 
addition french queries are selected randomly from a 
french query log containing around million queries and are 
manually translated into english by professional french-english 
translators among the french queries queries have 
their translations in the english query log and are used for clqs 
training and testing furthermore among the french 
queries are used for cross-lingual query similarity training 
 are used as the development data to determine the relevancy 
threshold and are used for testing to retrieve the 
crosslingual related queries a built-in-house french-english bilingual 
lexicon containing unique entries and the europarl 
corpus are used 
besides benchmarking clqs as an independent system the 
clqs is also tested as a query translation system for clir 
tasks based on the observation that the clir performance 
heavily relies on the quality of the suggested queries this 
benchmark measures the quality of clqs in terms of its 
effectiveness in helping clir to perform such benchmark we 
use the documents of trec clir data ap - newswire 
 mb with officially provided short french-english queries 
pairs cl -cl the selection of this data set is due to the fact 
that the average length of the queries are words long which 
matches the web query logs we use to train clqs

more relevant queries the most significant improvement on recall 
is achieved by exploiting mlqs the final clqs system is able 
to generate of the queries suggested by mlqs among all 
the feature combinations there is no significant change in 
precision this indicates that our methods can improve the recall 
by effectively leveraging various information sources without 
losing the accuracy of the suggestions 
besides benchmarking clqs by comparing its output with 
mlqs output french queries are randomly selected from the 
french query log these queries are double-checked to make sure 
that they are not in the clqs training corpus then clqs system 
is used to suggest relevant english queries for them on average 
for each french query relevant english queries are suggested 
then the total suggested english queries are manually 
checked by two professional english french translators with 
cross-validation among the suggested queries 
queries are recognized as relevant to the original ones hence the 
accuracy is figure shows an example of clqs of the 
french query terrorisme international international terrorism

 clir performance 
in this section clqs is tested with french to english clir tasks 
we conduct clir experiments using the trec clir dataset 
described in section the clir is performed using a query 
translation system followed by a bm -based monolingual 
ir module the following three different systems have been used 
to perform query translation clqs our clqs system 
mt google french to english machine translation system 
dt a dictionary based query translation system using 
cooccurrence statistics for translation disambiguation the 
translation disambiguation algorithm is presented in section 
besides the monolingual ir performance is also reported as a

clqs 
the benchmark shows that using clqs as a query translation 
tool outperforms clir based on machine translation by 
outperforms clir based on dictionary translation by and 
achieves of the monolingual ir performance 
the effectiveness of clqs lies in its ability in suggesting 
closely related queries besides accurate translations for example 
for the query cl terrorisme international international 
terrorism although the machine translation tool translates the 
query correctly clqs system still achieves higher score by 
recommending many additional related terms such as global 
terrorism world terrorism etc as shown in figure another 
example is the query la pollution causée par l automobile air 
pollution due to automobile of cl the mt tool provides the 
translation the pollution caused by the car while clqs system 
enumerates all the possible synonyms of car and suggest the 
following queries car pollution auto pollution automobile 
pollution besides other related queries such as global 
warming are also suggested for the query cl la culture 
écologique organic farming the mt tool fails to generate the 
correct translation although the correct translation is neither in 
our french-english dictionary clqs system generates organic 
farm as a relevant query due to successful web mining 
the above experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of using 
clqs to suggest relevant queries for clir enhancement a 
related research is to perform query expansion to enhance clir 
 so it is very interesting to compare the clqs approach 
with the conventional query expansion approaches following 
 post-translation expansion is performed based on 
pseudorelevance feedback prf techniques we first perform clir in 
the same way as before then we use the traditional prf 
algorithm described in to select expansion terms in our 
experiments the top terms are selected to expand the original 
query and the new query is used to search the collection for the 
second time the new clir performance in terms of average 
precision is shown in table the -point p-r curves are drawn 
in figure 
although being enhanced by pseudo-relevance feedback the 
clir using either machine translation or dictionary-based query 
translation still does not perform as well as clqs-based 
approach statistical t-test is conducted to indicate whether 
the clqs-based clir performs significantly better pair-wise 
pvalues are shown in table clearly clqs significantly 
outperforms mt and dt without prf as well as dt prf but its 
superiority over mt prf is not significant however when 
combined with prf clqs significant outperforms all the other 
methods this indicates the higher effectiveness of clqs in 
related term identification by leveraging a wide spectrum of 
resources furthermore post-translation expansion is capable of 
improving clqs-based clir this is due to the fact that clqs 
and pseudo-relevance feedback are leveraging different categories 
of resources and both approaches can be complementary

 conclusions 
in this paper we proposed a new approach to cross-lingual query 
suggestion by mining relevant queries in different languages from 
query logs the key solution to this problem is to learn a 
crosslingual query similarity measure by a discriminative model 
exploiting multiple monolingual and bilingual resources the 
model is trained based on the principle that cross-lingual 
similarity should best fit the monolingual similarity between one 
query and the other query s translation

table comparison of average precision ap on trec 
without and with post-translation expansion are the 
relative percentages over the monolingual ir performance 
table the results of pair-wise significance t-test here 
pvalue is considered statistically significant 
the baseline clqs system applies a typical query translation 
approach using a bilingual dictionary with co-occurrence-based 
translation disambiguation this approach only covers of the 
relevant queries suggested by an mlqs system when the exact 
translation of the original query is given by leveraging 
additional resources such as parallel corpora web mining and 
logbased monolingual query expansion the final system is able to 
cover of the relevant queries suggested by an mlqs system 
with precision as high as 
to further test the quality of the suggested queries clqs system 
is used as a query translation system in clir tasks 
benchmarked using trec french to english clir task clqs 
demonstrates higher effectiveness than the traditional query 
translation methods using either bilingual dictionary or 
commercial machine translation tools 
the improvement on trec french to english clir task by 
using clqs demonstrates the high quality of the suggested 
queries this also shows the strong correspondence between the 
input french queries and english queries in the log in the future 
we will build clqs system between languages which may be 
more loosely correlated e g english and chinese and study the 
clqs performance change due to the less strong correspondence 
among queries in such languages
