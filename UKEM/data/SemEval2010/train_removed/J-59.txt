abstract 
a set of jobs need to be served by a single server which can 
serve only one job at a time jobs have processing times 
and incur waiting costs linear in their waiting time the 
jobs share their costs through compensation using monetary 
transfers we characterize the shapley value rule for this 
model using fairness axioms our axioms include a bound 
on the cost share of jobs in a group efficiency and some 
independence properties on the the cost share of a job

 introduction 
a set of jobs need to be served by a server the server can 
process only one job at a time each job has a finite 
processing time and a per unit time waiting cost efficient ordering 
of this queue directs us to serve the jobs in increasing 
order of the ratio of per unit time waiting cost and processing 
time to compensate for waiting by jobs monetary 
transfers to jobs are allowed how should the jobs share the cost 
equitably amongst themselves through transfers 
the problem of fair division of costs among agents in a 
queue has many practical applications for example 
computer programs are regularly scheduled on servers data are 
scheduled to be transmitted over networks jobs are 
scheduled in shop-floor on machines and queues appear in many 
public services post offices banks study of queueing 
problems has attracted economists for a long time 
cost sharing is a fundamental problem in many settings 
on the internet internet can be seen as a common resource 
shared by many users and the cost incured by using the 
resource needs to be shared in an equitable manner the 
current surge in cost sharing literature from computer 
scientists validate this claim internet has many 
settings in which our model of job scheduling appears and 
the agents waiting in a queue incur costs jobs scheduled on 
servers queries answered from a database data scheduled 
to be transmitted over a fixed bandwidth network etc we 
hope that our analysis will give new insights on cost sharing 
problems of this nature 
recently there has been increased interest in cost 
sharing methods with submodular cost functions 
while many settings do have submodular cost functions for 
example multi-cast transmission games while the cost 
function of our game is supermodular also such literature 
typically does not assume budget-balance transfers adding 
up to zero while it is an inherent feature of our model 
a recent paper by maniquet is the closest to our model 
and is the motivation behind our work 
 maniquet 
studies a model where he assumes all processing times are 
unity for such a model he characterizes the shapley value 
rule using classical fairness axioms chun interprets the 
worth of a coalition of jobs in a different manner for the same 
model and derives a reverse rule chun characterizes this 
rule using similar fairness axioms chun also studies the 
envy properties of these rules moulin studies the 
queueing problem from a strategic point view when per unit 
waiting costs are unity moulin introduces new concepts in 
the queueing settings such as splitting and merging of jobs 
and ways to prevent them 
another stream of literature is on sequencing games 
first introduced by curiel et al for a detailed survey 
refer to curiel et al curiel et al defined sequencing 
games similar to our model but in which an initial ordering 
of jobs is given besides their notion of worth of a coalition 
is very different from the notions studied in maniquet 
and chun these are the notions used in our work too 
the particular notion of the worth of a coalition makes the 
sequencing game of curiel et al convex whereas our 
game is not convex and does not assume the presence of 
any initial order in summary the focus of this stream of 
 
the authors thank fran¸cois maniquet for several fruitful 
discussions 
 
research is how to share the savings in costs from the 
initial ordering to the optimal ordering amongst jobs also see 
hamers et al curiel et al recently klijn and 
s´anchez considered sequencing games without any 
initial ordering of jobs they take two approaches to define 
the worth of coalitions one of their approaches called the 
tail game is related to the reverse rule of chun in the 
tail game jobs in a coalition are served after the jobs not in 
the coalition are served klijn and s´anchez showed that 
the tail game is balanced further they provide expressions 
for the shapley value in tail game in terms of marginal 
vectors and reversed marginal vectors we provide a simpler 
expression of the shapley value in the tail game 
generalizing the result in chun klijn and s´anchez study the 
core of this game in detail 
strategic aspects of queueing problems have also been 
researched mitra studies the first best implementation 
in queueing models with generic cost functions first best 
implementation means that there exists an efficient 
mechanism in which jobs in the queue have a dominant strategy 
to reveal their true types and their transfers add up to zero 
suijs shows that if waiting costs of jobs are linear then 
first best implementation is possible mitra shows that 
among a more general class of queueing problems first best 
implementation is possible if and only if the cost is linear 
for another queueing model mitra shows that first best 
implementation is possible if and only if the cost function 
satisfies a combinatorial property and an independence 
property moulin studies strategic concepts such as 
splitting and merging in queueing problems with unit per unit 
waiting costs 
the general cost sharing literature is vast and has a long 
history for a good survey we refer to from the 
seminal work of shapley to recent works on cost sharing in 
multi-cast transmission and optimization problems 
this area has attracted economists computer scientists and 
operations researchers 
 our contribution 
ours is the first model which considers cost sharing when 
both processing time and per unit waiting cost of jobs are 
present we take a cooperative game theory approach and 
apply the classical shapley value rule to the problem we 
show that the shapley value rule satisfies many intuitive 
fairness axioms due to two dimensional nature of our model 
and one dimensional nature of maniquet s model his 
axioms are insufficient to characterize the shapley value in 
our setting we introduce axioms such as independece of 
preceding jobs unit waiting cost and independence of following 
jobs processing time a key axiom that we introduce gives 
us a bound on cost share of a job in a group of jobs which 
have the same ratio of unit time waiting cost and 
processing time these jobs can be ordered in any manner between 
themseleves in an efficient ordering if such a group consists 
of just one job then the axiom says that such a job should 
at least pay his own processing cost i e the cost it would 
have incurred if it was the only job in the queue if there 
are multiple jobs in such a group the probability of any two 
jobs from such a group inflicting costs on each other is same 
 
 
 in an efficient ordering depending on the ordering 
selected one job inflicts cost on the other our fairness axiom 
says that each job should at least bear such expected costs 
we characterize the shapley value rule using these fairness 
axioms we also extend the envy results in to our setting 
and discuss a class of reasonable cost sharing mechanisms 
 the model 
there are n jobs that need to be served by one server 
which can process only one job at a time the set of jobs 
are denoted as n n σ n → n is an ordering of 
jobs in n and σi denotes the position of job i in the ordering 
σ given an ordering σ define fi σ j ∈ n σi σj 
and pi σ j ∈ n σi σj 
every job i is identified by two parameters pi θi pi 
is the processing time and θi is the cost per unit waiting 
time of job i thus a queueing problem is defined by a list 
q n p θ ∈ q where q is the set of all possible lists we 
will denote γi θi 
pi 
 given an ordering of jobs σ the cost 
incurred by job i is given by 
ci σ piθi θi 
 
j∈pi σ 
pj 
the total cost incurred by all jobs due to an ordering σ 
can be written in two ways i by summing the cost incurred 
by every job and ii by summing the costs inflicted by a job 
on other jobs with their own processing cost

an efficient ordering σ 
is the one which minimizes the 
total cost incurred by all jobs so c n σ 
 ≤ c n σ ∀ σ ∈ 
σ to achieve notational simplicity we will write the total 
cost in an efficient ordering of jobs from n as c n 
whenever it is not confusing sometimes we will deal with only 
a subset of jobs s ⊆ n the ordering σ will then be 
defined on jobs in s only and we will write the total cost from 
an efficient ordering of jobs in s as c s the following 
lemma shows that jobs are ordered in decreasing γ in an 
efficient ordering this is also known as the weighted shortest 
processing time rule first introduced by smith 
lemma for any s ⊆ n let σ 
be an efficient ordering 
of jobs in s for every i j i j ∈ s if σ 
i σ 
j then 
γi ≤ γj 
proof assume for contradiction that the statment of 
the lemma is not true this means we can find two 
consecutive jobs i j ∈ s σ 
i σ 
j such that γi γj 
define a new ordering σ by interchanging i and j in σ 
 
the costs to jobs in s \ i j is not changed from σ 
to σ 
the difference between total costs in σ 
and σ is given by 
c s σ − c s σ 
 θjpi − θipj from efficiency we get 
θjpi − θipj ≥ this gives us γj ≥ γi which is a 
contradiction 
an allocation for q n p θ ∈ q has two components 
an ordering σ and a transfer ti for every job i ∈ n ti 
denotes the payment received by job i given a transfer ti 
and an ordering σ the cost share of job i is defined as 
πi ci σ − ti θi 
 
j∈n σj ≤σi 
pj − ti 
 
an allocation σ t is efficient for q n p θ whenever 
σ is an efficient ordering and £i∈n ti the set of 
efficient orderings of q is denoted as σ 
 q and σ 
 q will be 
used to refer to a typical element of the set the following 
straightforward lemma says that for two different efficient 
orderings the cost share in one efficient allocation is 
possible to achieve in the other by appropriately modifying the 
transfers 
lemma let σ t be an efficient allocation and π be the 
vector of cost shares of jobs from this allocation if σ 
 σ 
be an efficient ordering and t 
i ci σ 
 − πi ∀ i ∈ n then 
 σ 
 t 
 is also an efficient allocation 
proof since σ t is efficient £i∈n ti this gives 
£i∈n πi c n since σ 
is an efficient ordering £i∈n ci σ 
 
c n this means £i∈n t 
i £i∈n ci σ 
 − πi so 
 σ 
 t 
 is an efficient allocation 
depending on the transfers the cost shares in different 
efficient allocations may differ an allocation rule ψ associates 
with every q ∈ q a non-empty subset ψ q of allocations 
 cost sharing using the shapley 
value 
in this section we define the coalitional cost of this game 
and analyze the solution proposed by the shapley value 
given a queue q ∈ q the cost of a coalition of s ⊆ n jobs 
in the queue is defined as the cost incurred by jobs in s if 
these are the only jobs served in the queue using an efficient 
ordering formally the cost of a coalition s ⊆ n is

where σ 
 σ 
 s is an efficient ordering considering jobs 
from s only the worth of a coalition of s jobs is just 
−c s maniquet observes another equivalent way to 
define the worth of a coalition is using the dual function of 
the cost function c · other interesting ways to define the 
worth of a coalition in such games is discussed by chun 
who assume that a coalition of jobs are served after the jobs 
not in the coalition are served 
the shapley value or cost share of a job i is defined as

the shapley value allocation rule says that jobs are ordered 
using an efficient ordering and transfers are assigned to jobs

 axiomaticcharacterizationof 
the shapley value 
in this section we will define serveral axioms on fairness 
and characterize the shapley value using them for a given 
q ∈ q we will denote ψ q as the set of allocations from 
allocation rule ψ also we will denote the cost share vector 
associated with an allocation rule σ t as π and that with 
allocation rule σ t as π etc 
 the fairness axioms 
we will define three types of fairness axioms i related 
to efficiency ii related to equity and iii related to 
independence 
efficiency axioms 
we define two types of efficiency axioms one related to 
efficiency which states that an efficient ordering should be 
selected and the transfers of jobs should add up to zero 
 budget balance 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies efficiency if 
for every q ∈ q and σ t ∈ ψ q σ t is an efficient 
allocation 
 
the second axiom related to efficiency says that the 
allocation rule should not discriminate between two allocations 
which are equivalent to each other in terms of cost shares of 
jobs 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies pareto 
indifference if for every q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q and σ t ∈ σ q 
we have 
 πi πi ∀ i ∈ n¢⇒ 
 σ t ∈ ψ q ¢ 
an implication of pareto indifference axiom and lemma 
 is that for every efficient ordering there is some set of 
transfers of jobs such that it is part of an efficient rule and 
the cost share of a job in all these allocations are same 
equity axioms 
how should the cost be shared between two jobs if the jobs 
have some kind of similarity between them equity axioms 
provide us with fairness properties which help us answer 
this question we provide five such axioms some of these 
axioms for example anonymity equal treatment of equals 
are standard in the literature while some are new 
we start with a well known equity axiom called anonymity 
denote ρ n → n as a permutation of elements in n let 
ρ σ t denote the allocation obtained by permuting elements 
in σ and t according to ρ similarly let ρ p θ denote the 
new list of p θ obtained by permuting elements of p and θ 
according to ρ our first equity axiom states that allocation 
rules should be immune to such permutation of data 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies anonymity if 
for all q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q and every permutation ρ we then 
ρ σ t ∈ ψ n ρ q 
the next equity axiom is classical in literature and says 
that two similar jobs should be compensated such that their 
cost shares are equal this implies that if all the jobs are of 
same type then jobs should equally share the total system 
cost 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies equal 
treatment of equals ete if for all q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q 
i j ∈ n then 
 pi pj θi θj¢⇒ 
 πi πj¢ 
ete directs us to share costs equally between jobs if they 
are of the same per unit waiting cost and processing time 
but it is silent about the cost shares of two jobs i and j 
which satisfy θi 
pi 
 
θj 
pj 
 we introduce a new axiom for this 
if an efficient rule chooses σ such that σi σj for some 
i j ∈ n then job i is inflicting a cost of piθj on job j 
and job j is inflicting zero cost on job i define for some 
γ ≥ s γ i ∈ n γi γ in an efficient rule the 
elements in s γ can be ordered in any manner in s γ 
ways if i j ∈ s γ then we have pjθi piθj probability 
of σi σj is 
 
and so is the probability of σi σj the 
expected cost i inflicts on j is 
 
piθj and j inflicts on i is 
 
 
pjθi our next fairness axiom says that i and j should 
each be responsible for their own processing cost and this 
expected cost they inflict on each other arguing for every 
pair of jobs i j ∈ s γ we establish a bound on the cost 
share of jobs in s γ we impose this as an equity axiom 
below 
definition an allocation rule satisfies expected cost 
bound ecb if for all q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q with π being the 
resulting cost share for any γ ≥ and for every i ∈ s γ 
we have 
πi ≥ piθi 
 
 
 
j∈s γ σj σi 
pjθi 
 
j∈s γ σj σi 
piθj¢ 
the central idea behind this axiom is that of expected 
cost inflicted if an allocation rule chooses multiple 
allocations we can assign equal probabilities of selecting one of 
the allocations in that case the expected cost inflicted by 
a job i on another job j in the allocation rule can be 
calculated our axiom says that the cost share of a job should 
be at least its own processing cost and the total expected 
cost it inflicts on others note that the above bound poses 
no constraints on how the costs are shared among different 
groups also observe that if s γ contains just one job ecb 
says that job should at least bear its own processing cost 
a direct consequence of ecb is the following lemma 
lemma let ψ be an efficient rule which satisfies ecb 
for a q ∈ q if s γ n then for any σ t ∈ ψ q which 
gives a cost share of π πi piθi 
 
 li ri¢∀ i ∈ n 
proof from ecb we get πi ≥ piθi 
 
 li ri¢∀ i ∈ n 
assume for contradiction that there exists j ∈ n such that 
πj pjθj 
 
 li ri¢ using efficiency and the fact 
that £i∈n li £i∈n ri we get £i∈n πi c n 
£i∈n piθi 
 
£i∈n 
 li ri¢ c n this gives us a 
contradiction 
next we introduce an axiom about sharing the transfer 
of a job between a set of jobs in particular if the last 
job quits the system then the ordering need not change 
but the transfer to the last job needs to be shared between 
the other jobs this should be done in proportion to their 
processing times because every job influenced the last job 
based on its processing time 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies 
proportionate responsibility of p prp if for all q ∈ q for all 
 σ t ∈ ψ q k ∈ n such that σk n q n \ 
 k p θ ∈ q such that for all i ∈ n\ k θi θi pi pi 
there exists σ t ∈ ψ q such that for all i ∈ n \ k 
σi σi and 
ti ti tk 
pi 
£j k pj 
 
an analogous fairness axiom results if we remove the job 
from the beginning of the queue since the presence of the 
first job influenced each job depending on their θ values its 
transfer needs to be shared in proportion to θ values 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies 
proportionate responsibility of θ prθ if for all q ∈ q for all 
 σ t ∈ ψ q k ∈ n such that σk q n \ k p θ ∈ 
q such that for all i ∈ n \ k θi θi pi pi there exists 
 σ t ∈ ψ q such that for all i ∈ n \ k σi σi and 
ti ti tk 
θi 
£j k θj 
 
the proportionate responsibility axioms are 
generalizations of equal responsibility axioms introduced by 
maniquet 
 
independence axioms 
the waiting cost of a job does not depend on the per unit 
waiting cost of its preceding jobs similarly the waiting cost 
inflicted by a job to its following jobs is independent of the 
processing times of the following jobs these independence 
properties should be carried over to the cost sharing rules 
this gives us two independence axioms 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies independence 
of preceding jobs θ ipjθ if for all q n p θ q 
 n p θ ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q σ t ∈ ψ q if for all 
i ∈ n \ k θi θi pi pi and γk γk pk pk 
then for all j ∈ n such that σj σk πj πj where π is 
the cost share in σ t and π is the cost share in σ t 
definition an allocation rule ψ satisfies independence 
of following jobs p ifjp if for all q n p θ q 
 n p θ ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q σ t ∈ ψ q if for all 
i ∈ n \ k θi θi pi pi and γk γk θk θk 
then for all j ∈ n such that σj σk πj πj where π is 
the cost share in σ t and π is the cost share in σ t 
 the characterization results 
having stated the fairness axioms we propose three 
different ways to characterize the shapley value rule using 
these axioms all our characterizations involve efficiency 
and ecb but if we have ipjθ we either need ifjp or prp 
similarly if we have ifjp we either need ipjθ or prθ 
proposition any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ecb 
ipjθ and ifjp is a rule implied by the shapley value rule 
proof define for any i j ∈ n θi 
j γipj and pi 
j 
θj 
γi 
 assume without loss of generality that σ is an efficient 
ordering with σi i ∀ i ∈ n 
consider the following q n p θ corresponding to 
job i with pj pj if j ≤ i and pj pi 
j if j i θj θi 
j if 
j i and θj θj if j ≥ i observe that all jobs have the 
same γ γi by lemma and efficiency σ t ∈ ψ q for 
some set of transfers t using lemma we get cost share of 
i from σ t as πi piθi 
 
 li ri¢ now for any j i 
if we change θj to θj without changing processing time the 
new γ of j is γj ≥ γi applying ipjθ the cost share of job i 
should not change similarly for any job j i if we change 
pj to pj without changing θj the new γ of j is γj ≤ γi 
applying ifjp the cost share of job i should not change 
applying this procedure for every j i with ipjθ and for 
every j i with ifjp we reach q n p θ and the payoff 
of i does not change from πi using this argument for every 
i ∈ n and using the expression for the shapley value in 
lemma we get the shapley value rule 
it is possible to replace one of the independence axioms 
with an equity axiom on sharing the transfer of a job this 
is shown in propositions and 
proposition any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ecb 
ipjθ and prp is a rule implied by the shapley value rule 
proof as in the proof of proposition define θi 
j 
γipj ∀ i j ∈ n assume without loss of generality that σ is 
an efficient ordering with σi i ∀ i ∈ n 
consider a queue with jobs in set k i i 
where i n define q k p θ where θj θi 
j ∀ j ∈ 
k define σj σj ∀ j ∈ k σ is an efficient ordering 
for q by ecb and lemma the cost share of job i 
 in any allocation rule in ψ must be πi pi θi 
 
 
 £j i pjθi ¢ now consider q k p θ such that 
θj θi 
j ∀ j ≤ i and θi θi σ remains an efficient 
ordering in q and by ipjθ the cost share of i remains 
πi in q k \ i p θ we can calculate the 
cost share of job i using ecb and lemma as πi piθi 
 
 
£j i pjθi so using prp we get the new cost share of job 
i in q as πi πi ti 
pi 
j i pj 
 piθi 
 
 £j i pjθi 
piθi ¢ 
now we can set k k ∪ i as before we can 
find cost share of i in this queue as πi pi θi 
 
 
 £j i pjθi ¢ using prp we get the new cost share 
of job i in the new queue as πi piθi 
 
 £j i pjθi 
piθi piθi ¢ this process can be repeated till we add 
job n at which point cost share of i is piθi 
 
 £j i pjθi 
£j i piθj¢ then we can adjust the θ of preceding jobs of 
i to their original value and applying ipjθ the payoffs of 
jobs i through n will not change this gives us the shapley 
values of jobs i through n setting i we get cost shares 
of all the jobs from ψ as the shapley value 
proposition any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ecb 
ifjp and prθ is a rule implied by the shapley value rule 
proof the proof mirrors the proof of proposition we 
provide a short sketch analogous to the proof of 
proposition θs are kept equal to original data and processing times 
are initialized to pi 
j this allows us to use ifjp also 
contrast to proposition we consider k i i n and 
repeatedly add jobs to the beginning of the queue 
maintaining the same efficient ordering so we add the cost 
components of preceding jobs to the cost share of jobs in each 
iteration and converge to the shapley value rule 
the next proposition shows that the shapley value rule 
satisfies all the fairness axioms discussed 
proposition the shapley value rule satisfies efficiency 
pareto indifference anonymity ete ecb ipjθ ifjp prp 
and prθ 
proof the shapley value rule chooses an efficient 
ordering and by definition the payments add upto zero so it 
satisfies efficiency 
the shapley value assigns same cost share to a job 
irrespective of the efficient ordering chosen so it is pareto 
indifferent 
the shapley value is anonymous because the particular 
index of a job does not effect his ordering or cost share 
for ete consider two jobs i j ∈ n such that pi pj 
and θi θj without loss of generality assume the efficient 
ordering to be i j n now the shapley value 
of job i is

the set pi preceding jobs does not change in the new 
efficient ordering if γj is changed such that pj remains the 
same then the expression £j∈pi 
θipj is unchanged if p θ 
values of no other jobs are changed then the shapley value 
is unchanged by increasing γj for some j ∈ pi while keeping 
pj unchanged thus the shapley value rule satisfies ipjθ

satisfies ifjp

a similar argument shows that the shapley value rule 
satisfies prθ 
these series of propositions lead us to our main result 
theorem let ψ be an allocation rule the following 
statements are equivalent 
 for each q ∈ q ψ q selects all the allocation assigning 
jobs cost shares implied by the shapley value 
 ψ satisfies efficiency ecb ifjp and ipjθ 
 ψ satisfies efficiency ecb ifjp and prθ 
 ψ satisfies efficiency ecb prp and ipjθ 
proof the proof follows from propositions and 
 
 discussions 
 a reasonable class of cost sharing 
mechanisms 
in this section we will define a reasonable class of cost 
sharing mechanisms we will show how these reasonable 
mechanisms lead to the shapley value mechanism 
definition an allocation rule ψ is reasonable if for 
all q ∈ q and σ t ∈ ψ q we have for all i ∈ n 
ti α 
 θi 
 
j∈pi σ 
pj − pi 
 
j∈fi σ 
θj¢∀ i ∈ n 
where ≤ α ≤ 
the reasonable cost sharing mechanism says that every 
job should be paid a constant fraction of the difference 
between the waiting cost he incurs and the waiting cost he 
inflicts on other jobs if α then every job bears its 
own cost if α then every job gets compensated for its 
waiting cost but compensates others for the cost he inflicts 
on others the shapley value rule comes as a result of ete 
as shown in the following proposition 
proposition any efficient and reasonable allocation 
rule ψ that satisfies ete is a rule implied by the shapley 
value rule 
proof consider a q ∈ q in which pi pj and θi θj 
let σ t ∈ ψ q and π be the resulting cost shares from 
ete we get 
πi πj 
⇒ ci σ − ti cj σ − tj 
⇒ piθi − α li αri pjθj − α lj αrj 
 since ψ is efficient and reasonable 
⇒ − α li − lj α rj − ri 
 using pi pj θi θj 
⇒ − α α 
 using li − lj rj − ri 
⇒ α 
 
 
 
this gives us the shapley value rule by lemma 
 results on envy 
chun discusses a fariness condition called no-envy for 
the case when processing times of all jobs are unity 
definition an allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for 
all q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q and i j ∈ n we have πi ≤ ci σij 
 − 
tj where π is the cost share from allocation rule σ t and 
σij 
is the ordering obtaining by swapping i and j 
from the result in the shapley value rule does not 
satisfy no-envy in our model also to overcome this chun 
introduces the notion of adjusted no-envy which he shows 
is satisfied in the shapley value rule when processing times 
of all jobs are unity here we show that adjusted envy 
continues to hold in the shapley value rule in our model when 
processing times need not be unity 
as before denote σij 
be an ordering where the position 
of i and j is swapped from an ordering σ for adjusted 
noenvy if σ t is an allocation for some q ∈ q let tij 
be the 
 
transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with 
respect to ordering σij 
 observe that an allocation may not 
allow for calculation of tij 
 for example if ψ is efficient 
then tij 
cannot be calculated if σij 
is also not efficient for 
simplicity we state the definition of adjusted no-envy to 
apply to all such rules 
definition an allocation rule satisfies adjusted 
noenvy if for all q ∈ q σ t ∈ ψ q and i j ∈ n we have 
πi ≤ ci σij 
 − tij 
i 
proposition the shapley value rule satisfies adjusted 
no-envy

 conclusion 
we studied the problem of sharing costs for a job 
scheduling problem on a single server when jobs have processing 
times and unit time waiting costs we took a cooperative 
game theory approach and show that the famous the 
shapley value rule satisfies many nice fairness properties we 
characterized the shapley value rule using different intuitive 
fairness axioms 
in future we plan to further simplify some of the fairness 
axioms some initial simplifications already appear in 
where we provide an alternative axiom to ecb and also 
discuss the implication of transfers between jobs in stead of 
transfers from jobs to a central server we also plan to look 
at cost sharing mechanisms other than the shapley value 
investigating the strategic power of jobs in such mechanisms 
is another line of future research
