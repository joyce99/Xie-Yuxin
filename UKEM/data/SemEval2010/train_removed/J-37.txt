abstract 
finding an equilibrium of an extensive form game of 
imperfect information is a fundamental problem in computational 
game theory but current techniques do not scale to large 
games to address this we introduce the ordered game 
isomorphism and the related ordered game isomorphic 
abstraction transformation for a multi-player sequential game of 
imperfect information with observable actions and an 
ordered signal space we prove that any nash equilibrium in 
an abstracted smaller game obtained by one or more 
applications of the transformation can be easily converted into 
a nash equilibrium in the original game we present an 
algorithm gameshrink for abstracting the game using our 
isomorphism exhaustively its complexity is ˜o n 
 where n 
is the number of nodes in a structure we call the signal tree 
it is no larger than the game tree and on nontrivial games 
it is drastically smaller so gameshrink has time and space 
complexity sublinear in the size of the game tree using 
gameshrink we find an equilibrium to a poker game with 
 billion nodes-over four orders of magnitude more than 
in the largest poker game solved previously we discuss 
several electronic commerce applications for gameshrink 
to address even larger games we introduce approximation 
methods that do not preserve equilibrium but nevertheless 
yield ex post provably close-to-optimal strategies

 introduction 
in environments with more than one agent an agent s 
outcome is generally affected by the actions of the other 
agent s consequently the optimal action of one agent can 
depend on the others game theory provides a normative 
framework for analyzing such strategic situations in 
particular it provides solution concepts that define what rational 
behavior is in such settings the most famous and 
important solution concept is that of nash equilibrium it is 
a strategy profile one strategy for each agent in which no 
agent has incentive to deviate to a different strategy 
however for the concept to be operational we need algorithmic 
techniques for finding an equilibrium 
games can be classified as either games of perfect 
information or imperfect information chess and go are examples 
of the former and until recently most game playing work 
has been on games of this type to compute an optimal 
strategy in a perfect information game an agent traverses 
the game tree and evaluates individual nodes if the agent 
is able to traverse the entire game tree she simply computes 
an optimal strategy from the bottom-up using the principle 
of backward induction 
in computer science terms this is 
done using minimax search often in conjunction with 
αβ-pruning to reduce the search tree size and thus enhance 
speed minimax search runs in linear time in the size of the 
game tree 
the differentiating feature of games of imperfect 
information such as poker is that they are not fully observable 
when it is an agent s turn to move she does not have access 
to all of the information about the world in such games 
the decision of what to do at a point in time cannot 
generally be optimally made without considering decisions at all 
other points in time including ones on other paths of play 
because those other decisions affect the probabilities of 
being at different states at the current point in time thus 
the algorithms for perfect information games do not solve 
games of imperfect information 
for sequential games with imperfect information one could 
try to find an equilibrium using the normal matrix form 
where every contingency plan of the agent is a pure strategy 
for the agent 
unfortunately even if equivalent strategies 
 
this actually yields a solution that satisfies not only the 
nash equilibrium solution concept but a stronger solution 
concept called subgame perfect nash equilibrium 
 
this type of algorithm still does not scale to huge 
trees such as in chess or go but effective game-playing 
agents can be developed even then by evaluating 
intermediate nodes using a heuristic evaluation and then treating 
those nodes as leaves 
 
an -equilibrium in a normal form game with any 
 
are replaced by a single strategy this representation is 
generally exponential in the size of the game tree 
by observing that one needs to consider only sequences of 
moves rather than pure strategies one arrives 
at a more compact representation the sequence form which 
is linear in the size of the game tree 
for -player games 
there is a polynomial-sized in the size of the game tree 
linear programming formulation linear complementarity in 
the non-zero-sum case based on the sequence form such that 
strategies for players and correspond to primal and dual 
variables thus the equilibria of reasonable-sized -player 
games can be computed using this method 
however this approach still yields enormous unsolvable 
optimization problems for many real-world games such as 
poker 
 our approach 
in this paper we take a different approach to tackling 
the difficult problem of equilibrium computation instead 
of developing an equilibrium-finding method per se we 
instead develop a methodology for automatically abstracting 
games in such a way that any equilibrium in the smaller 
 abstracted game corresponds directly to an equilibrium in 
the original game thus by computing an equilibrium in 
the smaller game using any available equilibrium-finding 
algorithm we are able to construct an equilibrium in the 
original game the motivation is that an equilibrium for 
the smaller game can be computed drastically faster than 
for the original game 
to this end we introduce games with ordered signals 
 section a broad class of games that has enough structure 
which we can exploit for abstraction purposes instead of 
operating directly on the game tree something we found 
to be technically challenging we instead introduce the use 
of information filters section which coarsen the 
information each player receives they are used in our analysis 
and abstraction algorithm by operating only in the space 
of filters we are able to keep the strategic structure of the 
game intact while abstracting out details of the game in a 
way that is lossless from the perspective of equilibrium 
finding we introduce the ordered game isomorphism to describe 
strategically symmetric situations and the ordered game 
isomorphic abstraction transformation to take advantange of 
such symmetries section as our main equilibrium 
result we have the following 
constant number of agents can be constructed in 
quasipolynomial time but finding an exact equilibrium is 
ppad-complete even in a -player game the most 
prevalent algorithm for finding an equilibrium in a -agent 
game is lemke-howson but it takes exponentially many 
steps in the worst case for a survey of equilibrium 
computation in -player games see recently 
equilibriumfinding algorithms that enumerate supports i e sets of 
pure strategies that are played with positive probability 
have been shown efficient on many games and efficient 
mixed integer programming algorithms that search in the 
space of supports have been developed for more than 
two players many algorithms have been proposed but they 
currently only scale to very small games 
 
there were also early techniques that capitalized in 
different ways on the fact that in many games the vast majority 
of pure strategies are not played in equilibrium 
 
recently this approach was extended to handle 
computing sequential equilibria as well 
theorem let γ be a game with ordered 
signals and let f be an information filter for γ let 
f be an information filter constructed from f by 
one application of the ordered game isomorphic 
abstraction transformation and let σ be a nash 
equilibrium strategy profile of the induced game 
γf i e the game γ using the filter f if σ is 
constructed by using the corresponding strategies 
of σ then σ is a nash equilibrium of γf 
the proof of the theorem uses an equivalent 
characterization of nash equilibria σ is a nash equilibrium if and 
only if there exist beliefs μ players beliefs about unknown 
information at all points of the game reachable by σ such 
that σ is sequentially rational i e a best response given μ 
where μ is updated using bayes rule we can then use the 
fact that σ is a nash equilibrium to show that σ is a nash 
equilibrium considering only local properties of the game 
we also give an algorithm gameshrink for abstracting 
the game using our isomorphism exhaustively section 
its complexity is ˜o n 
 where n is the number of nodes in 
a structure we call the signal tree it is no larger than the 
game tree and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller 
so gameshrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 
the size of the game tree we present several algorithmic and 
data structure related speed improvements section 
and we demonstrate how a simple modification to our 
algorithm yields an approximation algorithm section 
 electronic commerce applications 
sequential games of imperfect information are ubiquitous 
for example in negotiation and in auctions often aspects 
of a player s knowledge are not pertinent for deciding what 
action the player should take at a given point in the game 
on the trivial end some aspects of a player s knowledge are 
never pertinent e g whether it is raining or not has no 
bearing on the bidding strategy in an art auction and such 
aspects can be completely left out of the model specification 
however some aspects can be pertinent in certain states 
of the game while they are not pertinent in other states 
and thus cannot be left out of the model completely 
furthermore it may be highly non-obvious which aspects are 
pertinent in which states of the game our algorithm 
automatically discovers which aspects are irrelevant in different 
states and eliminates those aspects of the game resulting 
in a more compact equivalent game representation 
one broad application area that has this property is 
sequential negotiation potentially over multiple issues 
another broad application area is sequential auctions 
 potentially over multiple goods for example in those states of 
a -object auction where bidder a can infer that his 
valuation is greater than that of bidder b bidder a can ignore all 
his other information about b s signals although that 
information would be relevant for inferring b s exact valuation 
furthermore in some states of the auction a bidder might 
not care which exact other bidders have which valuations 
but cares about which valuations are held by the other 
bidders in aggregate ignoring their identities many open-cry 
sequential auction and negotiation mechanisms fall within 
the game model studied in this paper specified in detail 
later as do certain other games in electronic commerce 
such as sequences of take-it-or-leave-it offers 
our techniques are in no way specific to an application 
the main experiment that we present in this paper is on 
 
a recreational game we chose a particular poker game as 
the benchmark problem because it yields an extremely 
complicated and enormous game tree it is a game of imperfect 
information it is fully specified as a game and the data is 
available and it has been posted as a challenge problem 
by others to our knowledge no such challenge 
problem instances have been proposed for electronic commerce 
applications that require solving sequential games 
 rhode island hold em poker 
poker is an enormously popular card game played around 
the world the world series of poker had over 
million dollars in total prize money including million 
for the main event increasingly poker players compete 
in online casinos and television stations regularly 
broadcast poker tournaments poker has been identified as an 
important research area in ai due to the uncertainty 
stemming from opponents cards opponents future actions and 
chance moves among other reasons 
almost since the field s founding game theory has been 
used to analyze different aspects of poker pp 
 - however this work was limited to tiny games that 
could be solved by hand more recently ai researchers have 
been applying the computational power of modern hardware 
to computing game theory-based strategies for larger games 
koller and pfeffer determined solutions to poker games with 
up to nodes using the sequence form and linear 
programming large-scale approximations have been 
developed but those methods do not provide any 
guarantees about the performance of the computed strategies 
furthermore the approximations were designed manually 
by a human expert our approach yields an automated 
abstraction mechanism along with theoretical guarantees on 
the strategies performance 
rhode island hold em was invented as a testbed for 
computational game playing it was designed so that it was 
similar in style to texas hold em yet not so large that 
devising reasonably intelligent strategies would be impossible 
 the rules of rhode island hold em as well as a discussion 
of how rhode island hold em can be modeled as a game 
with ordered signals that is it fits in our model is available 
in an extended version of this paper we applied the 
techniques developed in this paper to find an exact 
 minimax solution to rhode island hold em which has a game 
tree exceeding billion nodes 
applying the sequence form to rhode island hold em 
directly without abstraction yields a linear program with 
 rows and the same number of columns this is 
much too large for current linear programming algorithms 
to handle we used our gameshrink algorithm to reduce 
this with lossless abstraction and it yielded a linear program 
with rows and columns-with non-zero 
coefficients we then applied iterated elimination of 
dominated strategies which further reduced this to 
rows and columns applying iterated 
elimination of dominated strategies without gameshrink yielded 
 rows and columns which still would 
have been prohibitively large to solve gameshrink 
required less than one second to perform the shrinking i e 
to compute all of the ordered game isomorphic abstraction 
transformations using a ghz ibm eserver p with 
 gigabytes of ram the linear program solver actually 
needed gigabytes we solved it in days and hours 
using the interior-point barrier method of cplex version 
 we recently demonstrated our optimal rhode island 
hold em poker player at the aaai- conference and 
it is available for play on-line at http www cs cmu edu 
 gilpin gsi html 
while others have worked on computer programs for 
playing rhode island hold em no optimal strategy has been 
found before this is the largest poker game solved to date 
by over four orders of magnitude 
 games with ordered signals 
we work with a slightly restricted class of games as 
compared to the full generality of the extensive form this class 
which we call games with ordered signals is highly 
structured but still general enough to capture a wide range of 
strategic situations a game with ordered signals consists 
of a finite number of rounds within a round the players 
play a game on a directed tree the tree can be different in 
different rounds the only uncertainty players face stems 
from private signals the other players have received and from 
the unknown future signals in other words players observe 
each others actions but potentially not nature s actions 
in each round there can be public signals announced to all 
players and private signals confidentially communicated 
to individual players for simplicity we assume-as is the 
case in most recreational games-that within each round 
the number of private signals received is the same across 
players this could quite likely be relaxed we also assume 
that the legal actions that a player has are independent of 
the signals received for example in poker the legal 
betting actions are independent of the cards received finally 
the strongest assumption is that there is a partial ordering 
over sets of signals and the payoffs are increasing not 
necessarily strictly in these signals for example in poker this 
partial ordering corresponds exactly to the ranking of card 
hands

we will use the term game with ordered signals and the

 information filters 
in this subsection we define an information filter for 
ordered games instead of completely revealing a signal either 
public or private to a player the signal first passes through 
this filter which outputs a coarsened signal to the player by 
varying the filter applied to a game we are able to obtain 
a wide variety of games while keeping the underlying action 
space of the game intact we will use this when designing 
our abstraction techniques formally an information filter 
is as follows 
definition let γ i g l θ κ γ p ω u be an 
ordered game let sj

 we 
have the following simple but important result 
proposition a filtered ordered game is an extensive 
form game satisfying perfect recall 
a simple proof proceeds by constructing an extensive form 
game directly from the ordered game and showing that it 
satisfies perfect recall in determining the payoffs in a game 
with filtered signals we take the average over all real signals 
in the filtered class weighted by the probability of each real 
signal occurring

context of filtered ordered games

abstractions 
in this section we present our main technique for reducing 
the size of games we begin by defining a filtered signal tree 
which represents all of the chance moves in the game the 
bold edges i e the first two levels of the tree in the game 
trees in figure correspond to the filtered signal trees in 
each game 
definition associated with every ordered game γ 
i g l θ κ γ p ω u and information filter f is a 
filtered signal tree a directed tree in which each node 
corresponds to some revealed filtered signals and edges 
correspond to revealing specific filtered signals the nodes in the 
filtered signal tree represent the set of all possible revealed 
filtered signals public and private at some point in time the 
filtered public signals revealed in round j correspond to the 
nodes in the κj 
levels beginning at level

 we denote children of a node x as n x in 
addition we associate weights with the edges corresponding 
to the probability of the particular edge being chosen given 
that its parent was reached 
in many games there are certain situations in the game 
that can be thought of as being strategically equivalent to 
other situations in the game by melding these situations 
together it is possible to arrive at a strategically 
equivalent smaller game the next two definitions formalize this 
notion via the introduction of the ordered game isomorphic 
relation and the ordered game isomorphic abstraction 
transformation 
definition two subtrees beginning at internal nodes 
x and y of a filtered signal tree are ordered game 
isomorphic if x and y have the same parent and there is a 
bijection f n x → n y such that for w ∈ n x and 
v ∈ n y v f w implies the weights on the edges x w 
and y v are the same and the subtrees beginning at w and 
v are ordered game isomorphic two leaves

proof for an extensive form game a belief system μ

profile σ is sequentially rational at h given belief system μ if 
ui σi σ−i h μ ≥ ui τi σ−i h μ 
for all other strategies τi where i is the player who controls 
h a basic result proposition c characterizing nash 
equilibria dictates that σ is a nash equilibrium if and only 
if there is a belief system μ such that for every information 
set h with pr h σ the following two conditions hold 
 c σ is sequentially rational at h given μ and c μ x 
pr x σ 
pr h σ 
for all x ∈ h since σ is a nash equilibrium of γ 
there exists such a belief system μ for γf using μ we will 
construct a belief system μ for γ and show that conditions

figure gameshrink applied to a tiny two-person four-card two jacks and two kings poker game next 
to each game tree is the range of the information filter f dotted lines denote information sets which are 
labeled by the controlling player open circles are chance nodes with the indicated transition probabilities 
the root node is the chance node for player s card and the next level is for player s card the payment 
from player to player is given below each leaf in this example the algorithm reduces the game tree from

 the following three claims 
show that μ as calculated above supports σ as a nash 
equilibrium 
claim μ is a valid belief system for γf 
claim for all information sets h with pr h σ 
μ x pr x σ 
pr h σ 
for all x ∈ h 
claim for all information sets h with pr h σ 
σ is sequentially rational at h given μ 
the proofs of claims - are in an extended version of this 
paper by claims and we know that condition c 
holds by claim we know that condition c holds thus 
σ is a nash equilibrium 
 nontriviality of generalizing beyond this 
model 
our model does not capture general sequential games of 
imperfect information because it is restricted in two ways 
 as discussed above there is a special structure 
connecting the player actions and the chance actions for one 
the players are assumed to observe each others actions but 
nature s actions might not be publicly observable and 
there is a common ordering of signals in this subsection we 
show that removing either of these conditions can make our 
technique invalid 
first we demonstrate a failure when removing the first 
assumption consider the game in figure 
nodes a and 
b are in the same information set have the same parent 
 chance node have isomorphic subtrees with the same 
payoffs and nodes c and d also have similar structural 
properties by merging the subtrees beginning at a and b we get 
the game on the right in figure in this game player 
 s only nash equilibrium strategy is to play left but in 
the original game player knows that node c will never be 
reached and so should play right in that information set

figure example illustrating difficulty in 
developing a theory of equilibrium-preserving abstractions 
for general extensive form games 
removing the second assumption that the utility 
functions are based on a common ordering of signals can also 
cause failure consider a simple three-card game with a 
deck containing two jacks j and j and a king k 
where player s utility function is based on the ordering 
 
we thank albert xin jiang for providing this example 
 
k j ∼ j but player s utility function is based on the 
ordering j k j it is easy to check that in the 
abstracted game where player treats j and j as being 
equivalent the nash equilibrium does not correspond to 
a nash equilibrium in the original game 
 gameshrink an efficient 
algorithm for computing ordered 
game isomorphic abstraction 
transformations 
this section presents an algorithm gameshrink for 
conducting the abstractions it only needs to analyze the signal 
tree discussed above rather than the entire game tree 
we first present a subroutine that gameshrink uses it 
is a dynamic program for computing the ordered game 
isomorphic relation again it operates on the signal tree 
algorithm orderedgameisomorphic γ ϑ ϑ 
 if ϑ and ϑ have different parents then return false 
 if ϑ and ϑ are both leaves of the signal tree 
 a if ur 
 ϑ ˜z ur 
 ϑ ˜z for all ˜z ∈

over then return true 
 b otherwise return false 
 create a bipartite graph gϑ ϑ v v e with v 
n ϑ and v n ϑ 
 for each v ∈ v and v ∈ v 
if orderedgameisomorphic γ v v 
create edge v v 
 return true if gϑ ϑ has a perfect matching otherwise 
return false 
by evaluating this dynamic program from bottom to top 
algorithm determines in time polynomial in the size of 
the signal tree whether or not any pair of equal depth 
nodes x and y are ordered game isomorphic we can 
further speed up this computation by only examining nodes 
with the same parent since we know from step that 
no nodes with different parents are ordered game 
isomorphic the test in step a can be computed in o time 
by consulting the relation from the specification of the 
game each call to orderedgameisomorphic performs at 
most one perfect matching computation on a bipartite graph 
with o θ nodes and o θ 
 edges recall that θ is the 
set of signals using the ford-fulkerson algorithm for 
finding a maximal matching this takes o θ 
 time let 
s be the maximum number of signals possibly revealed in 
the game e g in rhode island hold em s because 
each of the two players has one card in the hand plus there 
are two cards on the table the number of nodes n in 
the signal tree is o θ s 
 the dynamic program visits each 
node in the signal tree with each visit requiring o θ 
 
calls to the orderedgameisomorphic routine so it takes 
o θ s 
 θ 
 θ 
 o θ s 
 time to compute the entire 
ordered game isomorphic relation 
while this is exponential in the number of revealed 
signals we now show that it is polynomial in the size of the 
signal tree-and thus polynomial in the size of the game tree 
 
we thank an anonymous person for this example 
because the signal tree is smaller than the game tree the 
number of nodes in the signal tree is 
n 
sx 
i 
iy 
j 
 θ − j 
 each term in the summation corresponds to the number of 
nodes at a specific depth of the tree the number of leaves 
is 
sy 
j 
 θ − j 
 θ 
s 
 
s 
which is a lower bound on the number of nodes for large 
 θ we can use the relation 
 n 
k 
´ 
∼ nk 
k 
to get 
 θ 
s 
 
s ∼ 
„ 
 θ s 
s 
 
s θ s 
and thus the number of leaves in the signal tree is ω θ s 
 
thus o θ s 
 o n θ 
 which proves that we can 
indeed compute the ordered game isomorphic relation in time 
polynomial in the number of nodes n of the signal tree 
the algorithm often runs in sublinear time and space in 
the size of the game tree because the signal tree is 
significantly smaller than the game tree in most nontrivial games 
 note that the input to the algorithm is not an explicit game 
tree but a specification of the rules so the algorithm does 
not need to read in the game tree see figure in 
general if an ordered game has r rounds and each round s stage 
game has at least b nonterminal leaves then the size of the 
signal tree is at most 
br of the size of the game tree for 
example in rhode island hold em the game tree has 
billion nodes while the signal tree only has 
given the orderedgameisomorphic routine for 
determining ordered game isomorphisms in an ordered game we 
are ready to present the main algorithm gameshrink 
algorithm gameshrink γ

in the 
filtered according to f signal tree 
if orderedgameisomorphic γ ϑ ϑ then 
fj 
 ϑ ← fj 
 ϑ ← fj 
 ϑ ∪ fj 
 ϑ 
 output f 
given as input an ordered game γ gameshrink applies 
the shrinking ideas presented above as aggressively as 
possible once it finishes there are no contractible nodes since it 
compares every pair of nodes at each level of the signal tree 
and it outputs the corresponding information filter f the 
correctness of gameshrink follows by a repeated application 
of theorem thus we have the following result 
theorem gameshrink finds all ordered game 
isomorphisms and applies the associated ordered game isomorphic 
abstraction transformations furthermore for any nash 
equilibrium σ of the abstracted game the strategy profile 
constructed for the original game from σ is a nash equilibrium 
the dominating factor in the run time of gameshrink is 
in the rth 
iteration of the main for-loop there are at most 
 
 θ 
s 
´ 
s nodes at this level where we again take s to be the 
maximum number of signals possibly revealed in the game 
thus the inner for-loop executes o 
„ θ 
s 
´ 
s 
 
 
times as 
discussed in the next subsection we use a union-find data 
structure to represent the information filter f each 
iteration of the inner for-loop possibly performs a union 
operation on the data structure performing m operations on 
a union-find data structure containing n elements takes 
o α m n amortized time per operation where α m n 
is the inverse ackermann s function which grows 
extremely slowly thus the total time for gameshrink is

 this is o

´´ 
 again 
although this is exponential in s it is ˜o n 
 where n is the 
number of nodes in the signal tree furthermore 
gameshrink tends to actually run in sublinear time and space in 
the size of the game tree because the signal tree is 
significantly smaller than the game tree in most nontrivial games 
as discussed above 
 efficiency enhancements 
we designed several speed enhancement techniques for 
gameshrink and all of them are incorporated into our 
implementation one technique is the use of the union-find 
data structure for storing the information filter f this 
data structure uses time almost linear in the number of 
operations initially each node in the signalling tree is 
its own set this corresponds to the identity information 
filter when two nodes are contracted they are joined into 
a new set upon termination the filtered signals for the 
abstracted game correspond exactly to the disjoint sets in 
the data structure this is an efficient method of recording 
contractions within the game tree and the memory 
requirements are only linear in the size of the signal tree 
determining whether two nodes are ordered game 
isomorphic requires us to determine if a bipartite graph has a 
perfect matching we can eliminate some of these computations 
by using easy-to-check necessary conditions for the ordered 
game isomorphic relation to hold one such condition is to 
check that the nodes have the same number of chances as 
being ranked according to higher than lower than and 
the same as the opponents we can precompute these 
frequencies for every game tree node this substantially speeds 
up gameshrink and we can leverage this database across 
multiple runs of the algorithm for example when trying 
different abstraction levels see next section the indices 
for this database depend on the private and public signals 
but not the order in which they were revealed and thus 
two nodes may have the same corresponding database 
entry this makes the database significantly more compact 
 for example in texas hold em the database is reduced by 
a factor 
 
 
´ 
 
´ 
 
´ 
 
 
 
´ 
 we store the histograms 
in a -dimensional database the first dimension is indexed 
by the private signals the second by the public signals the 
problem of computing the index in either one of the 
dimensions is exactly the problem of computing a bijection 
between all subsets of size r from a set of size n and 
integers in

 approximation methods 
some games are too large to compute an exact 
equilibrium even after using the presented abstraction technique 
this section discusses general techniques for computing 
approximately optimal strategy profiles for a two-player game 
we can always evaluate the worst-case performance of a 
strategy thus providing some objective evaluation of the 
strength of the strategy to illustrate this suppose we know 
player s planned strategy for some game we can then fix 
the probabilities of player s actions in the game tree as 
if they were chance moves then player is faced with a 
single-agent decision problem which can be solved 
bottomup maximizing expected payoff at every node thus we can 
objectively determine the expected worst-case performance 
of player s strategy this will be most useful when we 
want to evaluate how well a given strategy performs when 
we know that it is not an equilibrium strategy a 
variation of this technique may also be applied in n-person games 
where only one player s strategies are held fixed this 
technique provides ex post guarantees about the worst-case 
performance of a strategy and can be used independently of 
the method that is used to compute the strategies 
 state-space approximations 
by slightly modifying gameshrink we can obtain an 
algorithm that yields even smaller game trees at the expense 
of losing the equilibrium guarantees of theorem instead 
of requiring the payoffs at terminal nodes to match exactly 
we can instead compute a penalty that increases as the 
difference in utility between two nodes increases 
there are many ways in which the penalty function could 
be defined and implemented one possibility is to create 
edge weights in the bipartite graphs used in algorithm 
and then instead of requiring perfect matchings in the 
unweighted graph we would instead require perfect matchings 
with low cost i e only consider two nodes to be ordered 
game isomorphic if the corresponding bipartite graph has a 
perfect matching with cost below some threshold thus 
with this threshold as a parameter we have a knob to turn 
that in one extreme threshold yields an optimal 
abstraction and in the other extreme threshold ∞ yields 
a highly abstracted game this would in effect restrict 
players to ignoring all signals but still observing actions this 
knob also begets an anytime algorithm one can solve 
increasingly less abstracted versions of the game and evaluate 
the quality of the solution at every iteration using the ex post 
method discussed above 
 algorithmic approximations 
in the case of two-player zero-sum games the 
equilibrium computation can be modeled as a linear program lp 
which can in turn be solved using the simplex method this 
approach has inherent features which we can leverage into 
desirable properties in the context of solving games 
in the lp primal solutions correspond to strategies of 
player and dual solutions correspond to strategies of player 
 there are two versions of the simplex method the primal 
simplex and the dual simplex the primal simplex maintains 
primal feasibility and proceeds by finding better and better 
primal solutions until the dual solution vector is feasible 
 
at which point optimality has been reached analogously 
the dual simplex maintains dual feasibility and proceeds by 
finding increasingly better dual solutions until the primal 
solution vector is feasible the dual simplex method can 
be thought of as running the primal simplex method on the 
dual problem thus the primal and dual simplex 
methods serve as anytime algorithms for a given abstraction 
for players and respectively at any point in time they 
can output the best strategies found so far 
also for any feasible solution to the lp we can get bounds 
on the quality of the strategies by examining the primal and 
dual solutions when using the primal simplex method 
dual solutions may be read off of the lp tableau every 
feasible solution of the dual yields an upper bound on the 
optimal value of the primal and vice versa p thus 
without requiring further computation we get lower bounds 
on the expected utility of each agent s strategy against that 
agent s worst-case opponent 
one problem with the simplex method is that it is not a 
primal-dual algorithm that is it does not maintain both 
primal and dual feasibility throughout its execution in fact 
it only obtains primal and dual feasibility at the very end of 
execution in contrast there are interior-point methods for 
linear programming that maintain primal and dual 
feasibility throughout the execution for example many 
interiorpoint path-following algorithms have this property ch 
 we observe that running such a linear programming 
method yields a method for finding -equilibria i e 
strategy profiles in which no agent can increase her expected 
utility by more than by deviating a threshold on can also 
be used as a termination criterion for using the method as 
an anytime algorithm furthermore interior-point methods 
in this class have polynomial-time worst-case run time as 
opposed to the simplex algorithm which takes exponentially 
many steps in the worst case 
 related research 
functions that transform extensive form games have been 
introduced in contrast to our work those 
approaches were not for making the game smaller and easier 
to solve the main result is that a game can be derived 
from another by a sequence of those transformations if and 
only if the games have the same pure reduced normal form 
the pure reduced normal form is the extensive form game 
represented as a game in normal form where duplicates of 
pure strategies i e ones with identical payoffs are removed 
and players essentially select equivalence classes of 
strategies an extension to that work shows a similar result 
but for slightly different transformations and mixed reduced 
normal form games modern treatments of this prior 
work on game transformations exist ch 
the recent notion of weak isomorphism in extensive form 
games is related to our notion of restricted game 
isomorphism the motivation of that work was to justify solution 
concepts by arguing that they are invariant with respect 
to isomorphic transformations indeed the author shows 
among other things that many solution concepts including 
nash perfect subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium 
are invariant with respect to weak isomorphisms however 
that definition requires that the games to be tested for weak 
isomorphism are of the same size our focus is totally 
different we find strategically equivalent smaller games also 
their paper does not provide algorithms 
abstraction techniques have been used in artificial 
intelligence research before in contrast to our work most but 
not all research involving abstraction has been for 
singleagent problems e g furthermore the use of 
abstraction typically leads to sub-optimal solutions unlike 
the techniques presented in this paper which yield 
optimal solutions a notable exception is the use of abstraction 
to compute optimal strategies for the game of sprouts 
however a significant difference to our work is that sprouts 
is a game of perfect information 
one of the first pieces of research to use abstraction in 
multi-agent settings was the development of partition search 
which is the algorithm behind gib the world s first 
expertlevel computer bridge player in contrast to other 
game tree search algorithms which store a particular game 
position at each node of the search tree partition search 
stores groups of positions that are similar typically the 
similarity of two game positions is computed by ignoring the 
less important components of each game position and then 
checking whether the abstracted positions are similar-in 
some domain-specific expert-defined sense-to each other 
partition search can lead to substantial speed improvements 
over α-β-search however it is not game theory-based it 
does not consider information sets in the game tree and 
thus does not solve for the equilibrium of a game of 
imperfect information such as poker 
another difference is that 
the abstraction is defined by an expert human while our 
abstractions are determined automatically 
there has been some research on the use of abstraction 
for imperfect information games most notably billings et 
al describe a manually constructed abstraction for texas 
hold em poker and include promising results against expert 
players however this approach has significant drawbacks 
first it is highly specialized for texas hold em second 
a large amount of expert knowledge and effort was used in 
constructing the abstraction third the abstraction does 
not preserve equilibrium even if applied to a smaller game 
it might not yield a game-theoretic equilibrium promising 
ideas for abstraction in the context of general extensive form 
games have been described in an extended abstract but 
to our knowledge have not been fully developed 
 conclusions and discussion 
we introduced the ordered game isomorphic abstraction 
transformation and gave an algorithm gameshrink for 
abstracting the game using the isomorphism exhaustively we 
proved that in games with ordered signals any nash 
equilibrium in the smaller abstracted game maps directly to a 
nash equilibrium in the original game 
the complexity of gameshrink is ˜o n 
 where n is the 
number of nodes in the signal tree it is no larger than the 
game tree and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller 
so gameshrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 
 
bridge is also a game of imperfect information and 
partition search does not find the equilibrium for that 
game either instead partition search is used in 
conjunction with statistical sampling to simulate the uncertainty 
in bridge there are also other bridge programs that use 
search techniques for perfect information games in 
conjunction with statistical sampling and expert-defined 
abstraction such non-game-theoretic techniques are unlikely 
to be competitive in poker because of the greater importance 
of information hiding and bluffing 
 
the size of the game tree using gameshrink we found 
a minimax equilibrium to rhode island hold em a poker 
game with billion nodes in the game tree-over four 
orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game 
solved previously 
to further improve scalability we introduced an 
approximation variant of gameshrink which can be used as an 
anytime algorithm by varying a parameter that controls 
the coarseness of abstraction we also discussed how in 
a two-player zero-sum game linear programming can be 
used in an anytime manner to generate approximately 
optimal strategies of increasing quality the method also yields 
bounds on the suboptimality of the resulting strategies we 
are currently working on using these techniques for full-scale 
 -player limit texas hold em poker a highly popular card 
game whose game tree has about 
nodes that game 
tree size has required us to use the approximation version of 
gameshrink as well as round-based abstraction
