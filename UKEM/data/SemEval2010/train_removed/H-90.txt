abstract 
a major limitation of most existing retrieval models and systems 
is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and 
document collection information about the actual user and search 
context is largely ignored in this paper we study how to 
exploit implicit feedback information including previous queries and 
clickthrough information to improve retrieval accuracy in an 
interactive information retrieval setting we propose several 
contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models 
to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries 
with the current query for better ranking of documents we use 
the trec ap data to create a test collection with search context 
information and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test 
set experiment results show that using implicit feedback 
especially the clicked document summaries can improve retrieval

 introduction 
in most existing information retrieval models the retrieval 
problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents 
from a single query however the retrieval system can only have 
very limited clue about the user s information need an optimal 
retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context 
information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy whenever it 
is available indeed context-sensitive retrieval has been identified 
as a major challenge in information retrieval research 
there are many kinds of context that we can exploit relevance 
feedback can be considered as a way for a user to provide 
more context of search and is known to be effective for 
improving retrieval accuracy however relevance feedback requires that 
a user explicitly provides feedback information such as specifying 
the category of the information need or marking a subset of 
retrieved documents as relevant documents since it forces the user 
to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always 
obvious to the user a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback 
information thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be 
limited in real applications 
for this reason implicit feedback has attracted much attention 
recently in general the retrieval results using the 
user s initial query may not be satisfactory often the user would 
need to revise the query to improve the retrieval ranking accuracy 
 for a complex or difficult information need the user may need 
to modify his her query and view ranked documents with many 
iterations before the information need is completely satisfied in such 
an interactive retrieval scenario the information naturally available 
to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and 
the document collection - in general all the interaction history can 
be available to the retrieval system including past queries 
information about which documents the user has chosen to view and even 
how a user has read a document e g which part of a document the 
user spends a lot of time in reading we define implicit feedback 
broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history 
to improve retrieval results 
a major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve 
the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort for 
example if the current query is java without knowing any extra 
information it would be impossible to know whether it is intended 
to mean the java programming language or the java island in 
indonesia as a result the retrieved documents will likely have both 
kinds of documents - some may be about the programming 
language and some may be about the island however any particular 
user is unlikely searching for both types of documents such an 
ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information for 
example if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi 
programming it would strongly suggest that it is the programming 
language that the user is searching for 
implicit feedback was studied in several previous works in 
joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough 
information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback 
information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of 
people in a simulation study of the effectiveness of different 
implicit feedback algorithms was conducted and several retrieval 
models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were 
proposed and evaluated in some existing retrieval algorithms are 
adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of 
a user other related work on using context includes personalized 
search query log analysis context factors 
and implicit queries 
while the previous work has mostly focused on using 
clickthrough information in this paper we use both clickthrough 
information and preceding queries and focus on developing new 
context-sensitive language models for retrieval specifically we 
develop models for using implicit feedback information such as 
query and clickthrough history of the current search session to 
improve retrieval accuracy we use the kl-divergence retrieval model 
 as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as 
estimating a query language model based on the current query and 
any search context information we propose several statistical 
language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into 
the kl-divergence model 
one challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there 
does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation we thus 
use the trec ap data to create a test collection with implicit 
feedback information which can be used to quantitatively evaluate 
implicit feedback models to the best of our knowledge this is the 
first test set for implicit feedback we evaluate the proposed 
models using this data set the experimental results show that using 
implicit feedback information especially the clickthrough data can 
substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring 
additional effort from the user 
the remaining sections are organized as follows in section 
we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce 
some terms that we will use later in section we propose several 
implicit feedback models based on statistical language models in 
section we describe how we create the data set for implicit 
feedback experiments in section we evaluate different implicit 
feedback models on the created data set section is our conclusions 
and future work 
 problem definition 
there are two kinds of context information we can use for 
implicit feedback one is short-term context which is the immediate 
surrounding information which throws light on a user s current 
information need in a single session a session can be considered as a 
period consisting of all interactions for the same information need 
the category of a user s information need e g kids or sports 
previous queries and recently viewed documents are all examples of 
short-term context such information is most directly related to the 
current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be 
most useful for improving the current search in general short-term 
context is most useful for improving search in the current session 
but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different 
session the other kind of context is long-term context which refers 
to information such as a user s education level and general interest 
accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough 
information such information is generally stable for a long time and is 
often accumulated over time long-term context can be applicable 
to all sessions but may not be as effective as the short-term context 
in improving search accuracy for a particular session in this paper 
we focus on the short-term context though some of our methods 
can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context 
in a single search session a user may interact with the search 
system several times during interactions the user would 
continuously modify the query therefore for the current query qk 
 except for the first query of a search session there is a query history 
hq q qk− associated with it which consists of the 
preceding queries given by the same user in the current session note 
that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper 
in practice we need techniques to automatically discover session 
boundaries which have been studied in traditionally the 
retrieval system only uses the current query qk to do retrieval but 
the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about 
the user s current information need as seen in the java example 
given in the previous section indeed our previous work has 
shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving 
retrieval accuracy 
in addition to the query history there may be other short-term 
context information available for example a user would 
presumably frequently click some documents to view we refer to data 
associated with these actions as clickthrough history the 
clickthrough data may include the title summary and perhaps also the 
content and location e g the url of the clicked document 
although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually 
relevant to the user s information need we may safely assume that 
the displayed summary title information about the document is 
attractive to the user thus conveys information about the user s 
information need suppose we concatenate all the displayed text 
information about a document usually title and summary together we 
will also have a clicked summary ci in each round of retrieval in 
general we may have a history of clicked summaries c ck− 
we will also exploit such clickthrough history hc c ck− 
to improve our search accuracy for the current query qk previous 
work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough 
information 
both query history and clickthrough history are implicit 
feedback information which naturally exists in interactive information 
retrieval thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them in 
this paper we study how to exploit such information hq and hc 
develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough 
history into a retrieval ranking function and quantitatively evaluate 
these models 
 language models for 
contextsensitiveinformationretrieval 
intuitively the query history hq and clickthrough history hc 
are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query 
qk an important research question is how we can exploit such 
information effectively we propose to use statistical language 
models to model a user s information need and develop four specific 
context-sensitive language models to incorporate context 
information into a basic retrieval model 
 basic retrieval model 
we use the kullback-leibler kl divergence method as 
our basic retrieval method according to this model the retrieval 
task involves computing a query language model θq for a given 
query and a document language model θd for a document and then 
computing their kl divergence d θq θd which serves as the 
score of the document 
one advantage of this approach is that we can naturally 
incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our 
estimate of the query language model 
formally let hq q qk− be the query history and 
the current query be qk let hc c ck− be the 
clickthrough history note that ci is the concatenation of all clicked 
documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may 
reasonably treat all these summaries equally our task is to estimate 
a context query model which we denote by p w θk based on the 
current query qk as well as the query history hq and clickthrough 
history hc we now describe several different language models for 
exploiting hq and hc to estimate p w θk we will use c w x 
to denote the count of word w in text x which could be either a 
query or a clicked document s summary or any other text we will 
use x to denote the length of text x or the total number of words 
in x 
 fixed coefficient interpolation fixint 
our first idea is to summarize the query history hq with a 
unigram language model p w hq and the clickthrough history hc 
with another unigram language model p w hc then we linearly 
interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model 
p w h finally we interpolate the history model p w h with 
the current query model p w qk these models are defined as 
follows 
p w qi 
c w qi 
 qi 
p w hq 
 
k − 
i k− 
i 
p w qi 
p w ci 
c w ci 
 ci 
p w hc 
 
k − 
i k− 
i 
p w ci 
p w h βp w hc − β p w hq 
p w θk αp w qk − α p w h 
where β ∈ is a parameter to control the weight on each 
history model and where α ∈ is a parameter to control the 
weight on the current query and the history information 
if we combine these equations we see that 
p w θk αp w qk − α βp w hc − β p w hq 
that is the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient 
interpolation of three models p w qk p w hq and p w hc 
 bayesian interpolation bayesint 
one possible problem with the fixint approach is that the 
coefficients especially α are fixed across all the queries but intuitively 
if our current query qk is very long we should trust the current 
query more whereas if qk has just one word it may be beneficial 
to put more weight on the history to capture this intuition we treat 
p w hq and p w hc as dirichlet priors and qk as the observed 
data to estimate a context query model using bayesian estimator 
the estimated model is given by 
p w θk 
c w qk µp w hq νp w hc 
 qk µ ν 
 
 qk 
 qk µ ν 
p w qk 
µ ν 
 qk µ ν 
 
µ 
µ ν 
p w hq 
ν 
µ ν 
p w hc 
where µ is the prior sample size for p w hq and ν is the prior 
sample size for p w hc we see that the only difference between 
bayesint and fixint is the interpolation coefficients are now 
adaptive to the query length indeed when viewing bayesint as fixint 
we see that α qk 
 qk µ ν 
 β ν 
ν µ 
 thus with fixed µ and ν 
we will have a query-dependent α later we will show that such an 
adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α 
 online bayesian updating onlineup 
both fixint and bayesint summarize the history information by 
averaging the unigram language models estimated based on 
previous queries or clicked summaries this means that all previous 
queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries 
however as the user interacts with the system and acquires more 
knowledge about the information in the collection presumably the 
reformulated queries will become better and better thus assigning 
decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query 
more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable interestingly 
if we incrementally update our belief about the user s information 
need after seeing each query we could naturally obtain decaying 
weights on the previous queries since such an incremental online 
updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an 
interactive retrieval system we present it in a more general way 
in a typical retrieval system the retrieval system responds to 
every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list 
of documents in order to rank documents the system must have 
some model for the user s information need in the kl divergence 
retrieval model this means that the system must compute a query 
model whenever a user enters a new query a principled way of 
updating the query model is to use bayesian estimation which we 
discuss below 
 bayesian updating 
we first discuss how we apply bayesian estimation to update a 
query model in general let p w φ be our current query model 
and t be a new piece of text evidence observed e g t can be a 
query or a clicked summary to update the query model based on 
t we use φ to define a dirichlet prior parameterized as 
dir µt p w φ µt p wn φ 
where µt is the equivalent sample size of the prior we use 
dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial 
distributions with such a conjugate prior the predictive distribution of φ 
 or equivalently the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given 
by 
p w φ 
c w t µt p w φ 
 t µt 
 
where c w t is the count of w in t and t is the length of t 
parameter µt indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in 
terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with t for 
example µt indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to 
adding one extra word to t 
 sequential query model updating 
we now discuss how we can update our query model over time 
during an interactive retrieval process using bayesian estimation 
in general we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current 
query model φi at any moment as soon as we obtain some implicit 
feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text ti we will update 
the query model 
initially before we see any user query we may already have 
some information about the user for example we may have some 
information about what documents the user has viewed in the past 
we use such information to define a prior on the query model 
which is denoted by φ after we observe the first query q we 
can update the query model based on the new observed data q 
the updated query model φ can then be used for ranking 
documents in response to q as the user views some documents the 
displayed summary text for such documents c i e clicked 
summaries can serve as some new data for us to further update the 
query model to obtain φ as we obtain the second query q from 
the user we can update φ to obtain a new model φ in general 
we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the 
query model 
clearly we see two types of updating updating based on a 
new query qi updating based on a new clicked summary ci in 
both cases we can treat the current model as a prior of the context 
query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary 
as observed data thus we have the following updating equations 
p w φi 
c w qi µip w φi− 
 qi µi 
p w φi 
c w ci νip w φi 
 ci νi 
where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating 
the model based on a query while νi is the equivalent sample size 
for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary 
if we set µi or νi we essentially ignore the prior model 
thus would start a completely new query model based on the query 
qi or the clicked summary ci on the other hand if we set µi 
 ∞ or νi ∞ we essentially ignore the observed query or 
the clicked summary and do not update our model thus the model 
remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence in 
general the parameters µi and νi may have different values for 
different i for example at the very beginning we may have very 
sparse query history thus we could use a smaller µi but later as the 
query history is richer we can consider using a larger µi but in 
our experiments unless otherwise stated we set them to the same 
constants i e ∀i j µi µj νi νj 
note that we can take either p w φi or p w φi as our context 
query model for ranking documents this suggests that we do not 
have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round 
of retrieval instead as soon as we collect clicked summary ci we 
can update the query model and use p w φi to immediately rerank 
any documents that a user has not yet seen 
to score documents after seeing query qk we use p w φk i e 
p w θk p w φk 
 batch bayesian updating batchup 
if we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed 
constant the onlineup algorithm would introduce a decaying factor 
- repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low 
weight this may be appropriate for the query history as it is 
reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query 
formulation as time goes on but it is not necessarily appropriate for 
the clickthrough information especially because we use the 
displayed summary rather than the actual content of a clicked 
document one way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to 
the clickthrough data is to do onlineup only for the query history 
q q qi− but not for the clickthrough data c we first 
buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk 
of clickthrough data to update the model generated through 
running onlineup on previous queries the updating equations are as 
follows 
p w φi 
c w qi µip w φi− 
 qi µi 
p w ψi 
i− 
j c w cj νip w φi 
i− 
j cj νi 
where µi has the same interpretation as in onlineup but νi now 
indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries as 
in onlineup we set all µi s and νi s to the same value and to rank 
documents after seeing the current query qk we use 
p w θk p w ψk 
 data collection 
in order to quantitatively evaluate our models we need a data set 
which includes not only a text database and testing topics but also 
query history and clickthrough history for each topic since there 
is no such data set available to us we have to create one there 
are two choices one is to extract topics and any associated query 
history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a 
retrieval system e g search engine but the problem is that we 
have no relevance judgments on such data the other choice is to 
use a trec data set which has a text database topic description 
and relevance judgment file unfortunately there are no query 
history and clickthrough history data we decide to augment a trec 
data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data 
we select trec ap ap and ap data as our text database 
because ap data has been used in several trec tasks and has 
relatively complete judgments there are altogether news 
articles and the average document length is words most articles 
have titles if not we select the first sentence of the text as the 
title for the preprocessing we only do case folding and do not do 
stopword removal or stemming 
we select relatively difficult topics from trec topics - 
these topics have the worst average precision performance among 
trec topics - according to some baseline experiments using 
the kl-divergence model with bayesian prior smoothing the 
reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would 
have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order 
to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a 
relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the 
user in real applications we may also expect our models to be 
most useful for such difficult topics so our data collection strategy 
reflects the real world applications well 
we index the trec ap data set and set up a search engine and 
web interface for trec ap news articles we use subjects to do 
experiments to collect query history and clickthrough history data 
each subject is assigned topics and given the topic descriptions 
provided by trec for each topic the first query is the title of 
the topic given in the original trec topic description after the 
subject submits the query the search engine will do retrieval and 
return a ranked list of search results to the subject the subject will 
browse the results and maybe click one or more results to browse 
the full text of article s the subject may also modify the query to 
do another search for each topic the subject composes at least 
queries in our experiment only the first queries for each topic 
are used the user needs to select the topic number from a 
selection menu before submitting the query to the search engine so that 
we can easily detect the session boundary which is not the focus of 
our study we use a relational database to store user interactions 
including the submitted queries and clicked documents for each 
query we store the query terms and the associated result pages 
and for each clicked document we store the summary as shown 
on the search result page the summary of the article is query 
dependent and is computed online using fixed-length passage retrieval 
 kl divergence model with bayesian prior smoothing 
among for each of topics queries which we study in 
the experiment the average query length is words altogether 
there are documents clicked to view so on average there are 
around clicks per topic the average length of clicked summary

 experiments 
 experiment design 
our major hypothesis is that using search context i e query 
history and clickthrough information can help improve search 
accuracy in particular the search context can provide extra information 
to help us estimate a better query model than using just the current 
query so most of our experiments involve comparing the retrieval 
performance using the current query only thus ignoring any 
context with that using the current query as well as the search context 
since we collected four versions of queries for each topic we 
make such comparisons for each version of queries we use two 
performance measures mean average precision map this 
is the standard non-interpolated average precision and serves as a 
good measure of the overall ranking accuracy precision at 
documents pr  docs this measure does not average well but 
it is more meaningful than map and reflects the utility for users 
who only read the top documents in all cases the reported 
figure is the average over all of the topics 
we evaluate the four models for exploiting search context i e 
fixint bayesint onlineup and batchup each model has 
precisely two parameters α and β for fixint µ and ν for others 
note that µ and ν may need to be interpreted differently for 
different methods we vary these parameters and identify the optimal 
performance for each method we also vary the parameters to study 
the sensitivity of our algorithms to the setting of the parameters 
 result analysis 
 overall effect of search context 
we compare the optimal performances of four models with those 
using the current query only in table a row labeled with qi is 
the baseline performance and a row labeled with qi hq hc 
is the performance of using search context we can make several 
observations from this table 
 comparing the baseline performances indicates that on average 
reformulated queries are better than the previous queries with the 
performance of q being the best users generally formulate better 
and better queries 
 using search context generally has positive effect especially 
when the context is rich this can be seen from the fact that the 
 
http sifaka cs uiuc edu ir ucair qchistory zip 
improvement for q and q is generally more substantial compared 
with q actually in many cases with q using the context may 
hurt the performance probably because the history at that point is 
sparse when the search context is rich the performance 
improvement can be quite substantial for example batchup achieves 
 improvement in the mean average precision over q and 
 improvement over q the generally low precisions also 
make the relative improvement deceptively high though 
 among the four models using search context the performances 
of fixint and onlineup are clearly worse than those of bayesint 
and batchup since bayesint performs better than fixint and the 
main difference between bayesint and fixint is that the former uses 
an adaptive coefficient for interpolation the results suggest that 
using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a bayesian style 
interpolation makes sense the main difference between onlineup 
and batchup is that onlineup uses decaying coefficients to 
combine the multiple clicked summaries while batchup simply 
concatenates all clicked summaries therefore the fact that batchup 
is consistently better than onlineup indicates that the weights for 
combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying 
while onlineup is theoretically appealing its performance is 
inferior to bayesint and batchup likely because of the decaying 
coefficient overall batchup appears to be the best method when we 
vary the parameter settings 
we have two different kinds of search context - query history 
and clickthrough data we now look into the contribution of each 
kind of context 
 using query history only 
in each of four models we can turn off the clickthrough 
history data by setting parameters appropriately this allows us to 
evaluate the effect of using query history alone we use the same 
parameter setting for query history as in table the results are 
shown in table here we see that in general the benefit of using 
query history is very limited with mixed results this is different 
from what is reported in a previous study where using query 
history is consistently helpful another observation is that the 
context runs perform poorly at q but generally perform slightly 
better than the baselines for q and q this is again likely because 
at the beginning the initial query which is the title in the original 
trec topic description may not be a good query indeed on 
average performances of these first-generation queries are clearly 
poorer than those of all other user-formulated queries in the later 
generations yet another observation is that when using query 
history only the bayesint model appears to be better than other 
models since the clickthrough data is ignored onlineup and batchup

are essentially the same algorithm the displayed results thus 
reflect the variation caused by parameter µ a smaller setting of 
is seen better than a larger value of a more complete picture 
of the influence of the setting of µ can be seen from table where 
we show the performance figures for a wider range of values of µ 
the value of µ can be interpreted as how many words we regard 
the query history is worth a larger value thus puts more weight 
on the history and is seen to hurt the performance more when the 
history information is not rich thus while for q the best 
performance tends to be achieved for µ ∈ only when µ we 
see some small benefit for q as we would expect an excessively 
large µ would hurt the performance in general but q is hurt most 
and q is barely hurt indicating that as we accumulate more and 
more query history information we can put more and more weight 
on the history information this also suggests that a better strategy 
should probably dynamically adjust parameters according to how 
much history information we have 
the mixed query history results suggest that the positive effect 
of using implicit feedback information may have largely come from 
the use of clickthrough history which is indeed true as we discuss 
in the next subsection 
 using clickthrough history only 
we now turn off the query history and only use the clicked 
summaries plus the current query the results are shown in table we 
see that the benefit of using clickthrough information is much more 
significant than that of using query history we see an overall 
positive effect often with significant improvement over the baseline it 
is also clear that the richer the context data is the more 
improvement using clicked summaries can achieve other than some 
occasional degradation of precision at documents the improvement 
is fairly consistent and often quite substantial 
these results show that the clicked summary text is in general 
quite useful for inferring a user s information need intuitively 
using the summary text rather than the actual content of the 
document makes more sense as it is quite possible that the document 
behind a seemingly relevant summary is actually non-relevant 
 out of the clicked documents are relevant updating the 
query model based on such summaries would bring up the ranks 
of these relevant documents causing performance improvement 
however such improvement is really not beneficial for the user as 
the user has already seen these relevant documents to see how 
much improvement we have achieved on improving the ranks of 
the unseen relevant documents we exclude these relevant 
documents from our judgment file and recompute the performance of 
bayesint and the baseline using the new judgment file the results 
are shown in table note that the performance of the baseline 
method is lower due to the removal of the relevant documents 
which would have been generally ranked high in the results from 
table we see clearly that using clicked summaries also helps 
improve the ranks of unseen relevant documents significantly

table bayesint evaluated on unseen relevant documents 
one remaining question is whether the clickthrough data is still 
helpful if none of the clicked documents is relevant to answer 
this question we took out the relevant summaries from our 
clickthrough history data hc to obtain a smaller set of clicked 
summaries hc and re-evaluated the performance of the bayesint 
method using hc with the same setting of parameters as in 
table the results are shown in table we see that although the 
improvement is not as substantial as in table the average 
precision is improved across all generations of queries these results 
should be interpreted as very encouraging as they are based on only 
 non-relevant clickthroughs in reality a user would more likely 
click some relevant summaries which would help bring up more 
relevant documents as we have seen in table and table

table effect of using only non-relevant clickthrough data 
 additive effect of context information 
by comparing the results across table table and table 
we can see that the benefit of the query history information and 
that of clickthrough information are mostly additive i e 
combining them can achieve better performance than using each alone 
but most improvement has clearly come from the clickthrough 
information in table we show this effect for the batchup method 
 parameter sensitivity 
all four models have two parameters to control the relative weights 
of hq hc and qk though the parameterization is different from 
model to model in this subsection we study the parameter 
sensitivity for batchup which appears to perform relatively better than 
others batchup has two parameters µ and ν 
we first look at µ when µ is set to the query history is not 
used at all and we essentially just use the clickthrough data 
combined with the current query if we increase µ we will gradually 
incorporate more information from the previous queries in table 
we show how the average precision of batchup changes as we vary 
µ with ν fixed to where the best performance of batchup is 
achieved we see that the performance is mostly insensitive to the 
change of µ for q and q but is decreasing as µ increases for q 
the pattern is also similar when we set ν to other values 
in addition to the fact that q is generally worse than q q and 
q another possible reason why the sensitivity is lower for q and 
q may be that we generally have more clickthrough data 
available for q and q than for q and the dominating influence of the 
clickthrough data has made the small differences caused by µ less 
visible for q and q 
the best performance is generally achieved when µ is around 
 which means that the past query information is as useful as 
about words in the current query except for q there is clearly 
some tradeoff between the current query and the previous queries

table additive benefit of context information 
and using a balanced combination of them achieves better 
performance than using each of them alone 
we now turn to the other parameter ν when ν is set to we 
only use the clickthrough data when ν is set to ∞ we only use 
the query history and the current query with µ set to where 
the best performance of batchup is achieved we vary ν and show 
the results in table we see that the performance is also not very 
sensitive when ν ≤ with the best performance often achieved 
at ν this means that the combined information of query 
history and the current query is as useful as about words in the 
clickthrough data indicating that the clickthrough information is 
highly valuable 
overall these sensitivity results show that batchup not only 
performs better than other methods but also is quite robust 
 conclusions and future work 
in this paper we have explored how to exploit implicit 
feedback information including query history and clickthrough history 
within the same search session to improve information retrieval 
performance using the kl-divergence retrieval model as the 
basis we proposed and studied four statistical language models for 
context-sensitive information retrieval i e fixint bayesint

for evaluating implicit feedback models experiment results show 
that using implicit feedback especially clickthrough history can 
substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring any 
additional user effort 
the current work can be extended in several ways first we 
have only explored some very simple language models for 
incorporating implicit feedback information it would be interesting to 
develop more sophisticated models to better exploit query history 
and clickthrough history for example we may treat a clicked 
summary differently depending on whether the current query is a 
generalization or refinement of the previous query second the 
proposed models can be implemented in any practical systems we are 
currently developing a client-side personalized search agent which 
will incorporate some of the proposed algorithms we will also do 
a user study to evaluate effectiveness of these models in the real 
web search finally we should further study a general retrieval 
framework for sequential decision making in interactive 
information retrieval and study how to optimize some of the parameters in 
the context-sensitive retrieval models
