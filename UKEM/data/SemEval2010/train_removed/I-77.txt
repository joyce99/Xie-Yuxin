abstract 
successful negotiators prepare by determining their position 
along five dimensions legitimacy options goals 
independence and commitment logic we introduce a 
negotiation model based on these dimensions and on two primitive 
concepts intimacy degree of closeness and balance degree 
of fairness the intimacy is a pair of matrices that 
evaluate both an agent s contribution to the relationship and 
its opponent s contribution each from an information view 
and from a utilitarian view across the five logic 
dimensions the balance is the difference between these 
matrices a relationship strategy maintains a target intimacy for 
each relationship that an agent would like the relationship to 
move towards in future the negotiation strategy maintains 
a set of options that are in-line with the current intimacy 
level and then tactics wrap the options in argumentation 
with the aim of attaining a successful deal and 
manipulating the successive negotiation balances towards the target

 introduction 
in this paper we propose a new negotiation model to deal 
with long term relationships that are founded on successive 
negotiation encounters the model is grounded on results 
from business and psychological studies and 
acknowledges that negotiation is an information exchange 
process as well as a utility exchange process we 
believe that if agents are to succeed in real application domains 
they have to reconcile both views informational and 
gametheoretical our aim is to model trading scenarios where 
agents represent their human principals and thus we want 
their behaviour to be comprehensible by humans and to 
respect usual human negotiation procedures whilst being 
consistent with and somehow extending game theoretical and 
information theoretical results in this sense agents are not 
just utility maximisers but aim at building long lasting 
relationships with progressing levels of intimacy that determine 
what balance in information and resource sharing is 
acceptable to them these two concepts intimacy and balance are 
key in the model and enable us to understand competitive 
and co-operative game theory as two particular theories of 
agent relationships i e at different intimacy levels these 
two theories are too specific and distinct to describe how 
a business relationship might grow because interactions 
have some aspects of these two extremes on a continuum in 
which for example agents reveal increasing amounts of 
private information as their intimacy grows we don t follow 
the co-opetition aproach where co-operation and 
competition depend on the issue under negotiation but instead 
we belief that the willingness to co-operate compete affect 
all aspects in the negotiation process negotiation strategies 
can naturally be seen as procedures that select tactics used 
to attain a successful deal and to reach a target intimacy 
level it is common in human settings to use tactics that 
compensate for unbalances in one dimension of a 
negotiation with unbalances in another dimension in this sense 
humans aim at a general sense of fairness in an interaction 
in section we outline the aspects of human negotiation 
modelling that we cover in this work then in section 
we introduce the negotiation language section explains 
in outline the architecture and the concepts of intimacy and 
balance and how they influence the negotiation section 
contains a description of the different metrics used in the 
agent model including intimacy finally section outlines 
how strategies and tactics use the logic framework 
intimacy and balance 
 human negotiation 
before a negotiation starts human negotiators prepare the 
dialogic exchanges that can be made along the five logic 
dimensions 
 legitimacy what information is relevant to the 
negotiation process what are the persuasive arguments 
about the fairness of the options 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
 options what are the possible agreements we can 
accept 
 goals what are the underlying things we need or care 
about what are our goals 
 independence what will we do if the negotiation fails 
what alternatives have we got 
 commitment what outstanding commitments do we 
have 
negotiation dialogues in this context exchange 
dialogical moves i e messages with the intention of getting 
information about the opponent or giving away information 
about us along these five dimensions request for 
information propose options inform about interests issue promises 
appeal to standards a key part of any negotiation process 
is to build a model of our opponent s along these 
dimensions all utterances agents make during a negotiation give 
away information about their current logic model that 
is about their legitimacy options goals independence and 
commitments also several utterances can have a 
utilitarian interpretation in the sense that an agent can associate 
a preferential gain to them for instance an offer may 
inform our negotiation opponent about our willingness to sign 
a contract in the terms expressed in the offer and at the 
same time the opponent can compute what is its associated 
expected utilitarian gain these two views 
informationbased and utility-based are central in the model proposed 
in this paper 
 intimacy and balance in relationships 
there is evidence from psychological studies that humans 
seek a balance in their negotiation relationships the 
classical view is that people perceive resource allocations as 
being distributively fair i e well balanced if they are 
proportional to inputs or contributions i e equitable 
however more recent studies show that humans follow 
a richer set of norms of distributive justice depending on 
their intimacy level equity equality and need equity 
being the allocation proportional to the effort e g the profit 
of a company goes to the stock holders proportional to their 
investment equality being the allocation in equal amounts 
 e g two friends eat the same amount of a cake cooked by 
one of them and need being the allocation proportional to 
the need for the resource e g in case of food scarcity a 
mother gives all food to her baby for instance if we are in 
a purely economic setting low intimacy we might request 
equity for the options dimension but could accept equality 
in the goals dimension 
the perception of a relation being in balance i e fair 
depends strongly on the nature of the social relationships 
between individuals i e the intimacy level in purely 
economical relationships e g business equity is perceived as 
more fair in relations where joint action or fostering of social 
relationships are the goal e g friends equality is perceived 
as more fair and in situations where personal development 
or personal welfare are the goal e g family allocations are 
usually based on need 
we believe that the perception of balance in dialogues in 
negotiation or otherwise is grounded on social relationships 
and that every dimension of an interaction between humans 
can be correlated to the social closeness or intimacy 
between the parties involved according to the previous 
studies the more intimacy across the five logic dimensions the 
more the need norm is used and the less intimacy the more 
the equity norm is used this might be part of our social 
evolution there is ample evidence that when human 
societies evolved from a hunter-gatherer structure 
to a 
shelterbased one 
the probability of survival increased when food 
was scarce 
in this context we can clearly see that for instance 
families exchange not only goods but also information and 
knowledge based on need and that few families would consider 
their relationships as being unbalanced and thus unfair 
when there is a strong asymmetry in the exchanges a mother 
explaining everything to her children or buying toys does 
not expect reciprocity in the case of partners there is some 
evidence that the allocations of goods and burdens i e 
positive and negative utilities are perceived as fair or in 
balance based on equity for burdens and equality for goods 
see table for some examples of desired balances along the 
logic dimensions 
the perceived balance in a negotiation dialogue allows 
negotiators to infer information about their opponent about 
its logic stance and to compare their relationships with 
all negotiators for instance if we perceive that every time 
we request information it is provided and that no significant 
questions are returned or no complaints about not 
receiving information are given then that probably means that 
our opponent perceives our social relationship to be very 
close alternatively we can detect what issues are causing 
a burden to our opponent by observing an imbalance in the 
information or utilitarian senses on that issue 
 communication model 
 ontology 
in order to define a language to structure agent dialogues we 
need an ontology that includes a minimum repertoire of 
elements a set of concepts e g quantity quality material 
organised in a is-a hierarchy e g platypus is a mammal 
australian-dollar is a currency and a set of relations over 
these concepts e g price beer aud 
we model 
ontologies following an algebraic approach as 
an ontology is a tuple o c r ≤ σ where 
 c is a finite set of concept symbols including basic 
data types 
 r is a finite set of relation symbols 
 ≤ is a reflexive transitive and anti-symmetric relation 
on c a partial order 
 σ r → c 
is the function assigning to each relation 
symbol its arity 
 
in its purest form individuals in these societies collect food 
and consume it when and where it is found this is a pure 
equity sharing of the resources the gain is proportional to 
the effort 
 
in these societies there are family units around a shelter 
that represent the basic food sharing structure usually 
food is accumulated at the shelter for future use then the 
food intake depends more on the need of the members 
 
usually a set of axioms defined over the concepts and 
relations is also required we will omit this here

table some desired balances sense of fairness examples depending on the relationship 
where ≤ is the traditional is-a hierarchy to simplify 
computations in the computing of probability distributions we 
assume that there is a number of disjoint is-a trees covering 
different ontological spaces e g a tree for types of fabric 
a tree for shapes of clothing and so on r contains 
relations between the concepts in the hierarchy this is needed 
to define  objects e g deals that are defined as a tuple of 
issues 
the semantic distance between concepts within an 
ontology depends on how far away they are in the structure 
defined by the ≤ relation semantic distance plays a 
fundamental role in strategies for information-based agency how 
signed contracts commit · about objects in a particular 
semantic region and their execution done · affect our 
decision making process about signing future contracts in 
nearby semantic regions is crucial to modelling the common 
sense that human beings apply in managing trading 
relationships a measure bases the semantic similarity 
between two concepts on the path length induced by ≤ more 
distance in the ≤ graph means less semantic similarity and 
the depth of the subsumer concept common ancestor in the 
shortest path between the two concepts the deeper in the 
hierarchy the closer the meaning of the concepts semantic 
similarity is then defined as 
sim c c e−κ l 
· 
eκ h 
− e−κ h 
eκ h e−κ h 
where l is the length i e number of hops of the 
shortest path between the concepts h is the depth of the deepest 
concept subsuming both concepts and κ and κ are 
parameters scaling the contributions of the shortest path length 
and the depth respectively 
 language 
the shape of the language that α uses to represent the 
information received and the content of its dialogues depends on 
two fundamental notions first when agents interact within 
an overarching institution they explicitly or implicitly accept 
the norms that will constrain their behaviour and accept 
the established sanctions and penalties whenever norms are 
violated second the dialogues in which α engages are built 
around two fundamental actions i passing information 
and ii exchanging proposals and contracts a contract 
δ a b between agents α and β is a pair where a and b 
represent the actions that agents α and β are responsible 
for respectively contracts signed by agents and 
information passed by agents are similar to norms in the sense that 
they oblige agents to behave in a particular way so as to 
satisfy the conditions of the contract or to make the world 
consistent with the information passed contracts and 
information can thus be thought of as normative statements 
that restrict an agent s behaviour 
norms contracts and information have an obvious 
temporal dimension thus an agent has to abide by a norm 
while it is inside an institution a contract has a validity 
period and a piece of information is true only during an 
interval in time the set of norms affecting the behaviour of 
an agent defines the context that the agent has to take into 
account 
α s communication language has two fundamental 
primitives commit α β ϕ to represent in ϕ the world that α 
aims at bringing about and that β has the right to verify 
complain about or claim compensation for any deviations 
from and done μ to represent the event that a certain 
action μ 
has taken place in this way norms contracts 
and information chunks will be represented as instances of 
commit · where α and β can be individual agents or 
institutions c is 
μ illoc α β ϕ t μ μ 
let context in μ end 
ϕ term done μ commit α β ϕ ϕ ∧ ϕ 
ϕ ∨ ϕ ¬ϕ ∀v ϕv ∃v ϕv 
context ϕ id ϕ prolog clause context context 
where ϕv is a formula with free variable v illoc is any 
appropriate set of illocutionary particles   means sequencing 
and context represents either previous agreements previous 
illocutions the ontological working context that is a 
projection of the ontological trees that represent the focus of 
the conversation or code that aligns the ontological 
differences between the speakers needed to interpret an action 
a representing an ontology as a set predicates in prolog 
is simple the set term contains instances of the ontology 
concepts and relations 
for example we can represent the following offer if you 
spend a total of more than e in my shop during 
october then i will give you a discount on all goods in 
november as 
offer α β spent β α october x ∧ x ≥ e → 
∀ y done inform ξ α pay β α y november → 
commit α β discount y 
ξ is an institution agent that reports the payment 
 
without loss of generality we will assume that all actions 
are dialogical 
 
we assume the convention that c c means that c is an 
instance of concept c and r c cn implicitly determines 
that ci is an instance of the concept in the i-th position of 
the relation r

figure the logic agent architecture 
 agent architecture 
a multiagent system α β βn ξ θ θt contains 
an agent α that interacts with other argumentation agents 
βi information providing agents θj and an institutional 
agent ξ that represents the institution where we assume 
the interactions happen the institutional agent reports 
promptly and honestly on what actually occurs after an 
agent signs a contract or makes some other form of 
commitment in section this enables us to measure the 
difference between an utterance and a subsequent observation 
the communication language c introduced in section 
enables us both to structure the dialogues and to structure the 
processing of the information gathered by agents agents 
have a probabilistic first-order internal language l used to 
represent a world model mt 
 a generic information-based 
architecture is described in detail in 
the logic agent architecture is shown in figure agent 
α acts in response to a need that is expressed in terms of the 
ontology a need may be exogenous such as a need to trade 
profitably and may be triggered by another agent offering to 
trade or endogenous such as α deciding that it owns more 
wine than it requires needs trigger α s goal plan 
proactive reasoning while other messages are dealt with by α s 
reactive reasoning 
each plan prepares for the negotiation 
by assembling the contents of a  logic briefcase that the 
agent  carries into the negotiation 
 the relationship 
strategy determines which agent to negotiate with for a given 
need it uses risk management analysis to preserve a 
strategic set of trading relationships for each mission-critical need 
- this is not detailed here for each trading relationship 
this strategy generates a relationship target that is expressed 
in the logic framework as a desired level of intimacy to 
be achieved in the long term 
each negotiation consists of a dialogue ψt 
 between two 
agents with agent α contributing utterance μ and the 
part 
each of α s plans and reactions contain constructors for an 
initial world model mt 
 mt 
is then maintained from 
percepts received using update functions that transform 
percepts into constraints on mt 
- for details see 
 
empirical evidence shows that in human negotiation 
better outcomes are achieved by skewing the opening options 
in favour of the proposer we are unaware of any 
empirical investigation of this hypothesis for autonomous agents 
in real trading scenarios 
ner β contributing μ using the language described in 
section each dialogue ψt 
 is evaluated using the logic 
framework in terms of the value of ψt 
to both α and β - see 
section the negotiation strategy then determines the 
current set of options δi and then the tactics guided by 
the negotiation target decide which if any of these options 
to put forward and wraps them in argumentation dialogue 
- see section we now describe two of the distributions 
in mt 
that support offer exchange 
pt 
 acc α β χ δ estimates the probability that α should 
accept proposal δ in satisfaction of her need χ where δ 
 a b is a pair of commitments a for α and b for β α will 
accept δ if pt 
 acc α β χ δ c for level of certainty c 
this estimate is compounded from subjective and objective 
views of acceptability the subjective estimate takes account 
of the extent to which the enactment of δ will satisfy α s 
need χ how much δ is  worth to α and the extent to which 
α believes that she will be in a position to execute her 
commitment a sα β a is a random variable denoting 
α s estimate of β s subjective valuation of a over some finite 
numerical evaluation space the objective estimate captures 
whether δ is acceptable on the open market and variable 
uα b denotes α s open-market valuation of the enactment 
of commitment b again taken over some finite numerical 
valuation space we also consider needs the variable tα β a 
denotes α s estimate of the strength of β s motivating need 
for the enactment of commitment a over a valuation space

where g ∈ is α s greed h ∈ is α s degree of 
altruism and s ≈ is derived from the stance 
described in 
section the parameters g and h are independent we can 
imagine a relationship that begins with g and h 
then as the agents share increasing amounts of their 
information about their open market valuations g gradually 
reduces to and then as they share increasing amounts of 
information about their needs h increases to the basis 
for the acceptance criterion has thus developed from equity 
to equality and then to need 
pt 
 acc β α δ estimates the probability that β would 
accept δ by observing β s responses for example if β 
sends the message offer δ then α derives the constraint 
 pt 
 acc β α δ on the distribution pt 
 β α δ and 
if this is a counter offer to a former offer of α s δ then 
 pt 
 acc β α δ in the not-atypical special case of 
multi-issue bargaining where the agents preferences over the 
individual issues only are known and are complementary to 
each other s maximum entropy reasoning can be applied 
to estimate the probability that any multi-issue δ will be 
acceptable to β by enumerating the possible worlds that 
represent β s limit of acceptability 
 updating the world model mt 
α s world model consists of probability distributions that 
represent its uncertainty in the world state α is interested 
 
if α chooses to inflate her opening options then this is 
achieved in section by increasing the value of s if s 
then a deal may not be possible this illustrates the 
wellknown inefficiency of bilateral bargaining established 
analytically by myerson and satterthwaite in 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
in the degree to which an utterance accurately describes 
what will subsequently be observed all observations about 
the world are received as utterances from an all-truthful 
institution agent ξ for example if β communicates the goal 
i am hungry and the subsequent negotiation terminates 
with β purchasing a book from α by ξ advising α that a 
certain amount of money has been credited to α s account 
then α may conclude that the goal that β chose to satisfy 
was something other than hunger so α s world model 
contains probability distributions that represent its uncertain 
expectations of what will be observed on the basis of 
utterances received 
we represent the relationship between utterance ϕ and 
subsequent observation ϕ by pt 
 ϕ ϕ ∈ mt 
 where ϕ and 
ϕ may be ontological categories in the interest of 
computational feasibility for example if ϕ is i will deliver a bucket 
of fish to you tomorrow then the distribution p ϕ ϕ need 
not be over all possible things that β might do but could 
be over ontological categories that summarise β s possible 
actions 
in the absence of in-coming utterances the conditional 
probabilities pt 
 ϕ ϕ should tend to ignorance as 
represented by a decay limit distribution d ϕ ϕ α may have 
background knowledge concerning d ϕ ϕ as t → ∞ 
otherwise α may assume that it has maximum entropy whilst 
being consistent with the data in general given a 
distribution pt 
 xi and a decay limit distribution d xi pt 
 xi 
decays by 
pt 
 xi δi d xi pt

where δi is the decay function for the xi satisfying the 
property that limt→∞ pt

could be linear pt

where νi is the decay rate for the i th distribution 
either the decay function or the decay limit distribution 
could also be a function of time δt

suppose that α receives an utterance μ illoc α β ϕ t

 summary measures 
a dialogue ψt 
 between agents α and β is a sequence of 
inter-related utterances in context a relationship ψ t 
 is a 
sequence of dialogues we first measure the confidence that 
an agent has for another by observing for each utterance 
the difference between what is said the utterance and what 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
subsequently occurs the observation second we evaluate 
each dialogue as it progresses in terms of the logic 
framework - this evaluation employs the confidence measures 
finally we define the intimacy of a relationship as an 
aggregation of the value of its component dialogues 
 confidence 
confidence measures generalise what are commonly called 
trust reliability and reputation measures into a single 
computational framework that spans the logic categories in 
section confidence measures are applied to valuing 
fulfilment of promises in the legitimacy category - we formerly 
called this honour to the execution of commitments 
- we formerly called this trust and to valuing 
dialogues in the goals category - we formerly called this 
reliability

exchanged between agent α and agent β this 
negotiation dialogue is evaluated by α in the context of α s world 
model at time s ms 
 and the environment e that includes 
utterances that may have been received from other agents 
in the system including the information sources θi let

where the i · and u · functions are information-based and 
utility-based measures respectively as we now describe α 
estimates the value of this dialogue to β as vβ ψt 
 by 
assuming that β s reasoning apparatus mirrors its own 
in general terms the information-based valuations 
measure the reduction in uncertainty or information gain that 
the dialogue gives to each agent they are expressed in terms 
of decrease in entropy that can always be calculated the 
utility-based valuations measure utility gain are expressed in 
terms of some suitable utility evaluation function u · that 
can be difficult to define this is one reason why the 
utilitarian approach has no natural extension to the management 
of argumentation that is achieved here by our 
informationbased approach for example if α receives the utterance 
today is tuesday then this may be translated into a 
constraint on a single distribution and the resulting decrease 
in entropy is the information gain attaching a utilitarian 
measure to this utterance may not be so simple 
we use the term × array loosely to describe vα in 
that the elements of the array are lists of measures that will 
be determined by the agent s requirements table shows 
a sample measure for each of the ten categories in it the 
dialogue commences at time s and terminates at time t

 intimacy and balance

difference operator that respects the structure of v ψt

v t 
x continually decays by v t 
x τ × v t 
x − τ × 
dx where x α β τ is the decay rate and dx is a × 
 array being the decay limit distribution for the value to 
agent x of the intimacy of the relationship in the absence 
of any interaction dx is the reputation of agent x the 
relationship balance between agents α and β is b t

parameters g and h in equation as a simple example if 
both io

 and io

 increase then g decreases and as 
the remaining eight information-based logic components 
increase h increases 
the notion of balance may be applied to pairs of 
utterances by treating them as degenerate dialogues in simple 
multi-issue bargaining the equitable information revelation 
strategy generalises the tit-for-tat strategy in single-issue 
bargaining and extends to a tit-for-tat argumentation 
strategy by applying the same principle across the logic 
framework 
 strategies and tactics 
each negotiation has to achieve two goals first it may 
be intended to achieve some contractual outcome second 
it will aim to contribute to the growth or decline of the 
relationship intimacy 
we now describe in greater detail the contents of the 
negotiation box in figure the negotiation literature 
consistently advises that an agent s behaviour should not be 
predictable even in close intimate relationships the 
required variation of behaviour is normally described as 
varying the negotiation stance that informally varies from 
friendly guy to tough guy the stance is shown in figure 
it injects bounded random noise into the process where the 
bound tightens as intimacy increases the stance st 
αβ is a 
 × matrix of randomly chosen multipliers each ≈ that 
perturbs α s actions the value in the x y position in the 
matrix where x i u and y l o g i c is chosen at 
random from 
l i t 
αβ 
 x y 
 l i t 
αβ x y where l i t 
αβ x y is the 
bound and i t 
αβ is the intimacy 
the negotiation strategy is concerned with maintaining a 
working set of options if the set of options is empty then 
α will quit the negotiation α perturbs the acceptance 
machinery see section by deriving s from the st 
αβ matrix 
such as the value at the i o position in line with the 
comment in footnote in the early stages of the 
negotiation α may decide to inflate her opening options this is 
achieved by increasing the value of s in equation the 
following strategy uses the machinery described in section 
fix h g s and c set the options to the empty set let 
dt 
s δ pt 
 acc α β χ δ c then 
 repeat the following as many times as desired add 
δ arg maxx pt 
 acc β α x x ∈ dt 
s to options 
remove y ∈ dt 
s sim y δ k for some k from dt 
s 
by using pt 
 acc β α δ this strategy reacts to β s history 
of propose and reject utterances 
negotiation tactics are concerned with selecting some 
options and wrapping them in argumentation prior 
interactions with agent β will have produced an intimacy pattern 
expressed in the form of 
 
v t

 suppose that the 
relationship target is t t 
α t t 
β following from equation α 
will want to achieve a negotiation target nβ ψt

for small κ ∈ ν that represents α s desired rate of 
development for her relationship with β nβ ψt 
 is a × 
matrix containing variations in the logic dimensions that 
α would like to reveal to β during ψt 
 e g i ll pass a bit 
more information on options than usual i ll be stronger 
in concessions on options etc it is reasonable to 
expect β to progress towards her target at the same rate and 
nα ψt 
 is calculated by replacing β by α in equation 
nα ψt 
 is what α hopes to receive from β during ψt 
 this 
gives a negotiation balance target of nα ψt 
 nβ ψt 
 that 
can be used as the foundation for reactive tactics by 
striving to maintain this balance across the logic dimensions 
a cautious tactic could use the balance to bound the 
response μ to each utterance μ from β by the constraint 
vα μ vβ μ ≈ st 
αβ ⊗ nα ψt 
 nβ ψt 
 where ⊗ is 
element-by-element matrix multiplication and st 
αβ is the 
stance a less neurotic tactic could attempt to achieve the 
target negotiation balance over the anticipated complete 
dialogue if a balance bound requires negative information 
revelation in one logic category then α will contribute 
nothing to it and will leave this to the natural decay to the 
reputation d as described above 
 discussion 
in this paper we have introduced a novel approach to 
negotiation that uses information and game-theoretical 
measures grounded on business and psychological studies it 
introduces the concepts of intimacy and balance as key 
elements in understanding what is a negotiation strategy and 
tactic negotiation is understood as a dialogue that affect 
five basic dimensions legitimacy options goals 
independence and commitment each dialogical move produces a 
change in a × matrix that evaluates the dialogue along five 
information-based measures and five utility-based measures 
the current balance and intimacy levels and the desired or 
target levels are used by the tactics to determine what to 
say next we are currently exploring the use of this model as 
an extension of a currently widespread eprocurement
