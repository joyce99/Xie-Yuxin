abstract 
in visual information retrieval the careful choice of suitable 
proximity measures is a crucial success factor the evaluation 
presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures 
suggested by the mpeg- group for the visual descriptors can be 
beaten by general-purpose measures eight visual mpeg- 
descriptors were selected and distance measures implemented 
three media collections were created and assessed performance 
indicators developed and more than tests performed 
additionally a quantisation model was developed to be able to 
use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well 
the evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in 
the mpeg- -standard are among the best but that other measures 
perform even better

 introduction 
the mpeg- standard defines - among others - a set of 
descriptors for visual media each descriptor consists of a feature 
extraction mechanism a description in binary and xml format 
and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different 
kinds of media e g on temporal media the mpeg- descriptors 
have been carefully designed to meet - partially 
complementaryrequirements of different application domains archival browsing 
retrieval etc in the following we will exclusively deal with 
the visual mpeg- descriptors in the context of media retrieval 
the visual mpeg- descriptors fall in five groups colour 
texture shape motion and others e g face description and sum 
up to basic descriptors for retrieval applications a rule for 
each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the 
similarity of two descriptions common rules are distance 
functions like the euclidean distance and the mahalanobis 
distance unfortunately the mpeg- standard does not include 
distance measures in the normative part because it was not 
designed to be and should not exclusively understood to be 
retrieval-specific however the mpeg- authors give 
recommendations which distance measure to use on a particular 
descriptor these recommendations are based on accurate 
knowledge of the descriptors behaviour and the description 
structures 
in the present study a large number of successful distance 
measures from different areas statistics psychology medicine 
social and economic sciences etc were implemented and applied 
on mpeg- data vectors to verify whether or not the 
recommended mpeg- distance measures are really the best for 
any reasonable class of media objects from the mpeg- tests 
and the recommendations it does not become clear how many and 
which distance measures have been tested on the visual 
descriptors and the mpeg- test datasets the hypothesis is that 
analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but 
only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance 
measure for a specific feature extraction method 
the paper is organised as follows section gives a minimum of 
background information on the mpeg- descriptors and distance 
measurement in visual information retrieval vir see 
section gives an overview over the implemented distance 
measures section describes the test setup including the test 
data and the implemented evaluation methods finally section 
presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors 
 background 
 mpeg- visual descriptors 
the visual part of the mpeg- standard defines several 
descriptors not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that 
they extract properties from visual media some of them are just 
structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation the basic 
descriptors are color layout color structure dominant color 
scalable color edge histogram homogeneous texture texture 
browsing region-based shape contour-based shape camera 
motion parametric motion and motion activity 
other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic 
information group-of-frames group-of-pictures color based on 
scalable color shape d based on d mesh information 
motion trajectory based on object segmentation and face 
recognition based on face extraction 
descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are 
spatial d coordinates grid layout region locator spatial 
time series temporal interpolation temporal and 
spatiotemporal locator combined finally other structures 
exist for colour spaces colour quantisation and multiple d views 
of d objects 
these additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors 
in multiple ways and on different levels but they do not change 
the characteristics of the extracted information consequently 
structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in 
the work described in this paper 
 similarity measurement on visual data 
generally similarity measurement on visual information aims at 
imitating human visual similarity perception unfortunately 
human perception is much more complex than any of the existing 
similarity models it includes perception recognition and 
subjectivity 
the common approach in visual information retrieval is 
measuring dis-similarity as distance both query object and 
candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature 
vectors the distance between these objects is measured by 
computing the distance between the two vectors consequently 
the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm 
 e g query by example the query object may be natural e g a 
real object or artificial e g properties of a group of objects 
goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship 
between the two objects by their distance iteration for multiple 
candidates allows then to define a partial order over the 
candidates and to address those in a to be defined 
neighbourhood being similar to the query object at this point it 
has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor 
environmentespecially in mpeg- - we are only half way towards a statement 
on similarity if multiple descriptors are used e g a descriptor 
scheme a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to 
a global value for each object still distance measurement is the 
most important first step in similarity measurement 
obviously the main task of good distance measures is to 
reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the 
highest similarity are nearest to the query object if distance is 
defined minimal the query object is always in the origin of 
distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around 
the origin that are as large as possible consequently many well 
known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of 
descriptor space e g euclidean distance is based on the metric 
axioms unfortunately these measures do not fit ideally with 
human similarity perception e g due to human subjectivity to 
overcome this shortage researchers from different areas have 
developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based 
 descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements e g 
tversky s feature contrast model and fit better with human 
perception in the following distance measures of both groups of 
approaches will be considered 
 distance measures 
the distance measures used in this work have been collected from 
various areas subsection because they work on differently 
quantised data subsection sketches a model for unification on 
the basis of quantitative descriptions finally subsection 
introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the 
idea they implement 
 sources 
distance measurement is used in many research areas such as 
psychology sociology e g comparing test results medicine e g 
comparing parameters of test persons economics e g comparing 
balance sheet ratios etc naturally the character of data available 
in these areas differs significantly essentially there are two 
extreme cases of data vectors and distance measures 
predicatebased all vector elements are binary e g and quantitative 
 all vector elements are continuous e g 
predicates express the existence of properties and represent 
highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure 
and mostly represent low-level information predicates are often 
employed in psychology sociology and other human-related 
sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were 
therefore developed in these areas descriptions in visual 
information retrieval are nearly ever if they do not integrate 
semantic information quantitative consequently mostly 
quantitative distance measures are used in visual information 
retrieval 
the goal of this work is to compare the mpeg- distance 
measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in 
other areas since mpeg- descriptions are purely quantitative 
but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined 
exclusively on predicates a model is mandatory that allows the 
application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative 
data the model developed for this purpose is presented in the 
next section 
 quantisation model 
the goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators 
that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on 
continuous data the first in visual information retrieval to follow 
this approach were santini and jain who tried to apply tversky s 
feature contrast model to content-based image retrieval 
 they interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates 
and used fuzzy set operators unfortunately their model suffered 
from several shortcomings they described in for 
example the quantitative model worked only for one specific 
version of the original predicate-based measure 
the main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set 
operators are replaced by statistical functions in the authors 
could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable 
the model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the 
evaluation it is not specific to one distance measure but can be 
applied to any predicate-based measure below it will be shown 
that the model does not only work for predicate data but for 
quantitative data as well each measure implementing the model 
can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure 
generally binary properties of two objects e g media objects 
can exist in both objects denoted as a in just one b c or in 
none of them d the operator needed for these relationships are 
union minus and not in the quantisation model they are 
replaced as follows see for further details

a selects properties that are present in both data vectors xi xj 
representing media objects b and c select properties that are 
present in just one of them and d selects properties that are present 
in neither of the two data vectors every property is selected by 
the extent to which it is present a and d mean b and c 
difference and only if the amount to which it is present exceeds a 
certain threshold depending on the mean and standard deviation 
over all elements of descriptor space 
the implementation of these operators is based on one assumption 
it is assumed that vector elements measure on interval scale that 
means each element expresses that the measured property is 
 more or less present not at all m fully present this is 
true for most visual descriptors and all mpeg- descriptors a 
natural origin as it is assumed here is not needed 
introducing p called discriminance-defining parameter for the 
thresholds εε has the positive consequence that a b c d can 
then be controlled through a single parameter p is an additional 
criterion for the behaviour of a distance measure and determines 
the thresholds used in the operators it expresses how accurate 
data items are present quantisation and consequently how 
accurate they should be investigated p can be set by the user or 
automatically interesting are the limits 
 mp →⇒∞→ εε 
in this case all elements properties are assumed to be 
continuous high quantisation in consequence all properties of a 
descriptor are used by the operators then the distance measure is 
not discriminant for properties 
 →⇒→ εεp 
in this case all properties are assumed to be predicates in 
consequence only binary elements predicates are used by the 
operators -bit quantisation the distance measure is then highly 
discriminant for properties 
between these limits a distance measure that uses the 
quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less 
discriminant for properties this means it selects a subset of all 
available description vector elements for distance measurement 
for both predicate data and quantitative data it can be shown that 
the quantisation model is reasonable if description vectors consist 
of binary elements only p should be used as follows for example 
p can easily be set automatically 
 σµεε min ⇒→ pgep 
in this case a b c d measure like the set operators they replace 
for example table shows their behaviour for two 
onedimensional feature vectors xi and xj as can be seen the 
statistical measures work like set operators actually the 
quantisation model works accurate on predicate data for any p≠∞ 
to show that the model is reasonable for quantitative data the 
following fact is used it is easy to show that for predicate data 
some quantitative distance measures degenerate to 
predicatebased measures for example the l 
metric manhattan metric 
degenerates to the hamming distance from without weights

if it can be shown that the quantisation model is able to 
reconstruct the quantitative measure from the degenerated 
predicate-based measure the model is obviously able to extend 
predicate-based measures to the quantitative domain this is easy 
to illustrate for purely quantitative feature vectors p should be 
used as follows again p can easily be set automatically

the quantisation model successfully reconstructs the l 
metric 
and no distance measure-specific modification has to be made to 
the model this demonstrates that the model is reasonable in the 
following it will be used to extend successful predicate-based 
distance measures on the quantitative domain 
the major advantages of the quantisation model are it is 
application domain independent the implementation is 
straightforward the model is easy to use and finally the 
new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement 
process in a new way discriminance on property level 
 implemented measures 
for the evaluation described in this work next to predicate-based 
 based on the quantisation model and quantitative measures the 
distance measures recommended in the mpeg- standard were 
implemented all together different distance measures 
table summarises those predicate-based measures that 
performed best in the evaluation in sum predicate-based 
measures were investigated for these measures k is the number 
of predicates in the data vectors xi and xj in p the sum is used 
for tversky s f as tversky himself does in and α β are 
weights for element b and c in the author s investigated 
tversky s feature contrast model and found α β to be the 
optimum parameters 
some of the predicate-based measures are very simple e g p 
p but have been heavily exploited in psychological research 
pattern difference p - a very powerful measure - is used in the 
statistics package spss for cluster analysis p is a correlation 
coefficient for predicates developed by pearson 
table shows the best quantitative distance measures that were 
used q and q are metric-based and were implemented as 
representatives for the entire group of minkowski distances the 
wi are weights in q ii σµ are mean and standard deviation 
for the elements of descriptor xi in q m is 
 
m 
 q the 
canberra metric is a normalised form of q similarly q 
clark s divergence coefficient is a normalised version of q q is 
a further-developed correlation coefficient that is invariant against 
sign changes this measure is used even though its particular 
properties are of minor importance for this application domain 
finally q is a measure that takes the differences between 
adjacent vector elements into account this makes it structurally 
different from all other measures 
obviously one important distance measure is missing the 
mahalanobis distance was not considered because different 
descriptors would require different covariance matrices and for 
some descriptors it is simply impossible to define a covariance 
matrix if the identity matrix was used in this case the 
mahalanobis distance would degenerate to a minkowski distance 
additionally the recommended mpeg- distances were 
implemented with the following parameters in the distance 
measure of the color layout descriptor all weights were set to 
 as in all other implemented measures in the distance measure of 
the dominant color descriptor the following parameters were 
used dtww α as recommended in the 
homogeneous texture descriptor s distance all kα were set to 
 and matching was done rotation- and scale-invariant 
important some of the measures presented in this section are 
distance measures while others are similarity measures for the 
tests it is important to notice that all similarity measures were 
inverted to distance measures 
 test setup 
subsection describes the descriptors including parameters 
and the collections including ground truth information that were 
used in the evaluation subsection discusses the evaluation 
method that was implemented and subsection sketches the test 
environment used for the evaluation process 
 test data 
for the evaluation eight mpeg- descriptors were used all 
colour descriptors color layout color structure dominant 
color scalable color all texture descriptors edge histogram 
homogeneous texture texture browsing and one shape 
descriptor region-based shape texture browsing was used even 
though the mpeg- standard suggests that it is not suitable for 
retrieval the other basic shape descriptor contour-based shape 
was not used because it produces structurally different 
descriptions that cannot be transformed to data vectors with 
elements measuring on interval-scales the motion descriptors 
were not used because they integrate the temporal dimension of 
visual media and would only be comparable if the basic colour 
texture and shape descriptors would be aggregated over time this 
was not done finally no high-level descriptors were used 
 localisation face recognition etc see subsection 
because - to the author s opinion - the behaviour of the basic 
descriptors on elementary media objects should be evaluated 
before conclusions on aggregated structures can be drawn

the texture browsing descriptions had to be transformed from 
five bins to an eight bin representation in order that all elements 
of the descriptor measure on an interval scale a manhattan metric 
was used to measure proximity see for details 
descriptor extraction was performed using the mpeg- reference 
implementation in the extraction process each descriptor was 
applied on the entire content of each media object and the 
following extraction parameters were used colour in color 
structure was quantised to bins for dominant color colour 
space was set to ycrcb -bit default quantisation was used and 
the default value for spatial coherency was used homogeneous 
texture was quantised to components scalable color values 
were quantised to sizeof int - bits and bins were used finally 
texture browsing was used with five components 
these descriptors were applied on three media collections with 
image content the brodatz dataset images x pixel a 
subset of the corel dataset images x pixel portrait 
and landscape and a dataset with coats-of-arms images 
images x pixel figure shows examples from the three 
collections 
designing appropriate test sets for a visual evaluation is a highly 
difficult task for example see the trec video report 
of course for identifying the best distance measure for a 
descriptor it should be tested on an infinite number of media 
objects but this is not the aim of this study it is just evaluated if 
- for likely image collections - better proximity measures than 
those suggested by the mpeg- group can be found collections 
of this relatively small size were used in the evaluation because 
the applied evaluation methods are above a certain minimum size 
invariant against collection size and for smaller collections it is 
easier to define a high-quality ground truth still the average ratio 
of ground truth size to collection size is at least especially no 
collection from the mpeg- dataset was used in the evaluation 
because the evaluations should show how well the descriptors 
and the recommended distance measures perform on unknown 
material 
when the descriptor extraction was finished the resulting xml 
descriptions were transformed into a data matrix with lines 
 media objects and columns descriptor elements to be 
usable with distance measures that do not integrate domain 
knowledge the elements of this data matrix were normalised to 
 
for the distance evaluation - next to the normalised data 
matrixhuman similarity judgement is needed in this work the ground 
truth is built of twelve groups of similar images four for each 
dataset group membership was rated by humans based on 
semantic criterions table summarises the twelve groups and the 
underlying descriptions it has to be noticed that some of these 
groups especially and are much harder to find with 
lowlevel descriptors than others 
 evaluation method 
usually retrieval evaluation is performed based on a ground truth 
with recall and precision see for example in 
multidescriptor environments this leads to a problem because the 
resulting recall and precision values are strongly influenced by the 
method used to merge the distance values for one media object 
even though it is nearly impossible to say how big the influence 
of a single distance measure was on the resulting recall and 
precision values this problem has been almost ignored so far 
in subsection it was stated that the major task of a distance 
measure is to bring the relevant media objects as close to the 
origin where the query object lies as possible even in a 
multidescriptor environment it is then simple to identify the similar 
objects in a large distance space consequently it was decided to 
table quantitative distance measures

use indicators measuring the distribution in distance space of 
candidates similar to the query object for this evaluation instead 
of recall and precision identifying clusters of similar objects 
 based on the given ground truth is relatively easy because the 
resulting distance space for one descriptor and any distance 
measure is always one-dimensional clusters are found by 
searching from the origin of distance space to the first similar 
object grouping all following similar objects in the cluster 
breaking off the cluster with the first un-similar object and so 
forth 
for the evaluation two indicators were defined the first measures 
the average distance of all cluster means to the origin

 no clusters is the

additionally the standard deviation is used in the evaluation 
process this measure turned out to produce valuable results and to 
be relatively robust against parameter p of the quantisation model 
in subsection we noted that p affects the discriminance of a 
predicate-based distance measure the smaller p is set the larger 
are the resulting clusters because the quantisation model is then 
more discriminant against properties and less elements of the data 
matrix are used this causes a side-effect that is measured by the 
second indicator more and more un-similar objects come out with 
exactly the same distance value as similar objects a problem that 
does not exist for large p s and become indiscernible from similar 
objects consequently they are false cluster members this 
phenomenon conceptually similar to the false negatives

as pointed out above to generate the descriptors the mpeg- 
reference implementation in version was used provided by 
tu munich image processing was done with adobe photoshop 
and normalisation and all evaluations were done with perl the 
querying process was performed in the following steps 
random selection of a ground truth group random selection of 
a query object from this group distance comparison for all 
other objects in the dataset clustering of the resulting distance 
space based on the ground truth and finally evaluation 
for each combination of dataset and distance measure queries 
were issued and evaluations were aggregated over all datasets and 
descriptors the next section shows the - partially

 results 
in the results presented below the first indicator from subsection 
 was used to evaluate distance measures in a first step 
parameter p had to be set in a way that all measures are equally 
discriminant distance measurement is fair if the following 
condition holds true for any predicate-based measure dp and any 
continuous measure dc 
 cp dcppdcp ≈ 
then it is guaranteed that predicate-based measures do not create 
larger clusters with a higher number of similar objects for the 
price of higher cluster pollution in more than test queries 
the optimum value was found to be p 
results are organised as follows subsection summarises the

overall distance measures and section points out other 
interesting results for example distance measures that work 
particularly good on specific ground truth groups 
 best measure per descriptor 
figure shows the evaluation results for the first indicator for 
each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the 
mpeg- recommendation are shown the results are aggregated 
over the tested datasets 
on first sight it becomes clear that the mpeg- 
recommendations are mostly relatively good but never the best 
for color layout the difference between mp and the best 
measure the meehl index q is just and the mpeg- 
measure has a smaller standard deviation the reason why the 
meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates 
descriptions with elements that have very similar variance 
statistical analysis confirmed that see

region-based shape and scalable color by far the best measure is

perception has revealed that in many situation differences between 
the query object and a candidate weigh much stronger than 
common properties the pattern difference measure implements 
this insight in the most consequent way in the author s opinion 
the reason why pattern difference performs so extremely well on 
many descriptors is due to this fact additional advantages of 
pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance 
andbecause it is a predicate-based measure - its discriminance and 
cluster structure can be tuned with parameter p 
the best measure for dominant color turned out to be clark s 
divergence coefficient q this is a similar measure to pattern 
difference on the continuous domain the texture browsing 
descriptor is a special problem in the mpeg- standard it is 
recommended to use it exclusively for browsing after testing it 
for retrieval on various distance measures the author supports this 
opinion it is very difficult to find a good distance measure for 
texture browsing the proposed manhattan metric for example 
performs very bad the best measure is predicate-based p it 
works on common properties a d but produces clusters with 
very high cluster pollution for this descriptor the second 
indicator is up to eight times higher than for predicate-based 
measures on other descriptors 
 best overall measures 
figure summarises the results over all descriptors and media 
collections the diagram should give an indication on the general 
potential of the investigated distance measures for visual 
information retrieval 
it can be seen that the best overall measure is a predicate-based 
one the top performance of pattern difference p proves that 
the quantisation model is a reasonable method to extend 
predicate-based distance measures on the continuous domain the 
second best group of measures are the mpeg- 
recommendations which have a slightly higher mean but a lower 
standard deviation than pattern difference the third best measure 
is the meehl index q a measure developed for psychological 
applications but because of its characteristic properties 
tailormade for certain homogeneous descriptors 
minkowski metrics are also among the best measures the average 
mean and variance of the manhattan metric q and the 
euclidean metric q are in the range of q of course these 
measures do not perform particularly well for any of the 
descriptors remarkably for a predicate-based measure tversky s 
feature contrast model p is also in the group of very good 
measures even though it is not among the best that ends with 
q the correlation coefficient the other measures either have a 
significantly higher mean or a very large standard deviation 
 other interesting results 
distance measures that perform in average worse than others may 
in certain situations e g on specific content still perform better 
for color layout for example q is a very good measure on 
colour photos it performs as good as q and has a lower standard 
deviation for artificial images the pattern difference and the 
hamming distance produce comparable results as well 
if colour information is available in media objects pattern 
difference performs well on dominant color just worse q 
and in case of difficult ground truth group the meehl 
index is as strong as p

 conclusion 
the evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the 
recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the 
basic visual mpeg- descriptors eight descriptors were selected 
 distance measures were implemented media collections were 
created and assessed performance indicators were defined and 
more than tests were performed to be able to use 
predicate-based distance measures next to quantitative measures a 
quantisation model was defined that allows the application of 
predicate-based measures on continuous data 
in the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual 
content - as extracted by the visual mpeg- descriptors - turned 
out to be the pattern difference measure and the meehl index for 
homogeneous descriptions since these two measures perform 
significantly better than the mpeg- recommendations they 
should be further tested on large collections of image and video 
content e g from 
the choice of the right distance function for similarity 
measurement depends on the descriptor the queried media 
collection and the semantic level of the user s idea of similarity 
this work offers suitable distance measures for various situations 
in consequence the distance measures identified as the best will 
be implemented in the open mpeg- based visual information 
retrieval framework vizir
