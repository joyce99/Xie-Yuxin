abstract 
we study coalitional games where the value of cooperation 
among the agents are solely determined by the attributes 
the agents possess with no assumption as to how these 
attributes jointly determine this value this framework 
allows us to model diverse economic interactions by picking 
the right attributes we study the computational 
complexity of two coalitional solution concepts for these 
gamesthe shapley value and the core we show how the positive 
results obtained in this paper imply comparable results for 
other games studied in the literature

 introduction 
when agents interact with one another the value of their 
contribution is determined by what they can do with their 
skills and resources rather than simply their identities 
consider the problem of forming a soccer team for a team to 
be successful a team needs some forwards midfielders 
defenders and a goalkeeper the relevant attributes of the 
players are their skills at playing each of the four positions 
the value of a team depends on how well its players can play 
these positions at a finer level we can extend the model 
to consider a wider range of skills such as passing 
shooting and tackling but the value of a team remains solely a 
function of the attributes of its players 
consider an example from the business world 
companies in the metals industry are usually vertically-integrated 
and diversified they have mines for various types of ores 
and also mills capable of processing and producing 
different kinds of metal they optimize their production profile 
according to the market prices for their products for 
example when the price of aluminum goes up they will 
allocate more resources to producing aluminum however each 
company is limited by the amount of ores it has and its 
capacities in processing given kinds of ores two or more 
companies may benefit from trading ores and processing 
capacities with one another to model the metal industry the 
relevant attributes are the amount of ores and the 
processing capacities of the companies given the exogenous input 
of market prices the value of a group of companies will be 
determined by these attributes 
many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by 
picking the right attributes as attributes apply to both 
individual agents and groups of agents we propose the use 
of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may 
form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models 
coalitional game theory focuses on what groups of agents 
can achieve and thus connects strongly with e-commerce 
as the internet economies have significantly enhanced the 
abilities of business to identify and capitalize on profitable 
opportunities of cooperation our goal is to understand 
the computational aspects of computing the solution 
concepts stable and or fair distribution of payoffs formally 
defined in section for coalitional games described using 
attributes our contributions can be summarized as follows 
 we define a formal representation for coalitional games 
based on attributes and relate this representation to 
others proposed in the literature we show that when 
compared to other representations there exists games 
for which a multi-attribute description can be 
exponentially more succinct and for no game it is worse 
 given the generality of the model positive results carry 
over to other representations we discuss two positive 
results in the paper one for the shapley value and one 
for the core and show how these imply related results 
in the literature 
 
 we study an approximation heuristic for the shapley 
value when its exact values cannot be found efficiently 
we provide an explicit bound on the maximum error 
of the estimate and show that the bound is 
asymptotically tight we also carry out experiments to evaluate 
how the heuristic performs on random instances 
 related work 
coalitional game theory has been well studied in 
economics a vast amount of literature have focused 
on defining and comparing solution concepts and 
determining their existence and properties the first algorithmic 
study of coalitional games as far as we know is performed 
by deng and papadimitriou in they consider coalitional 
games defined on graphs where the players are the vertices 
and the value of coalition is determined by the sum of the 
weights of the edges spanned by these players this can be 
efficiently modeled and generalized using attributes 
as a formal representation multi-attribute coalitional games 
is closely related to the multi-issue representation of conitzer 
and sandholm and our work on marginal contribution 
networks both of these representations are based on 
dividing a coalitional game into subgames termed issues 
in and rules in and aggregating the subgames via 
linear combination the key difference in our work is the 
unrestricted aggregation of subgames the aggregation could 
be via a polynomial function of the attributes or even by 
treating the subgames as input to another computational 
problem such as a min-cost flow problem the relationship 
of these models will be made clear after we define the 
multiattribute representation in section 
another representation proposed in the literature is one 
specialized for superadditive games by conitzer and 
sandholm this representation is succinct but to find the 
values of some coalitions may require solving an np-hard 
problem while it is possible for multi-attribute coalitional 
games to efficiently represent these games it necessarily 
requires the solution to an np-hard problem in order to find 
out the values of some coalitions in this paper we stay 
within the boundary of games that admits efficient 
algorithm for determining the value of coalitions we will 
therefore not make further comparisons with 
the model of coalitional games with attributes has been 
considered in the works of shehory and kraus they model 
the agents as possessing capabilities that indicates their 
proficiencies in different areas and consider how to efficiently 
allocate tasks and the dynamics of coalition formation 
 our work differs significantly as our focus is on 
reasoning about solution concepts our model also covers a wider 
scope as attributes generalize the notion of capabilities 
yokoo et al have also considered a model of coalitional 
games where agents are modeled by sets of skills and these 
skills in turn determine the value of coalitions there are 
two major differences between their work and ours firstly 
yokoo et al assume that each skill is fundamentally different 
from another hence no two agents may possess the same 
skill also they focus on developing new solution concepts 
that are robust with respect to manipulation by agents our 
focus is on reasoning about traditional solution concepts 
 
we acknowledge that random instances may not be typical 
of what happens in practice but given the generality of our 
model it provides the most unbiased view 
our work is also related to the study of cooperative games 
with committee control in these games there is usually 
an underlying set of resources each controlled by a 
 possibly overlapping set of players known as the committee 
engaged in a simple game defined in section 
multiattribute coalitional games generalize these by considering 
relationship between the committee and the resources 
beyond simple games we note that when restricted to simple 
games we derive similar results to that in 
 preliminaries 
in this section we will review the relevant concepts of 
coalitional game theory and its two most important solution 
concepts - the shapley value and the core we will then 
define the computational questions that will be studied in 
the second half of the paper 
 coalitional games 
throughout this paper we assume that payoffs to groups 
of agents can be freely distributed among its members this 
transferable utility assumption is commonly made in 
coalitional game theory the canonical representation of a 
coalitional game with transferable utility is its characteristic form 
definition a coalition game with transferable utility in 
characteristic form is denoted by the pair n v where 
 n is the set of agents and 
 v n 
→ r is a function that maps each group of 
agents s ⊆ n to a real-valued payoff 
a group of agents in a game is known as a coalition and the 
entire set of agents is known as the grand coalition 
an important class of coalitional games is the class of 
monotonic games 
definition a coalitional game is monotonic if for all 
s ⊂ t ⊆ n v s ≤ v t 
another important class of coalitional games is the class 
of simple games in a simple game a coalition either wins 
in which case it has a value of or loses in which case it 
has a value of it is often used to model voting situations 
simple games are often assumed to be monotonic i e if s 
wins then for all t ⊇ s t also wins this coincides with 
the notion of using simple games as a model for voting if a 
simple game is monotonic then it is fully described by the 
set of minimal winning coalitions i e coalitions s for which 
v s but for all coalitions t ⊂ s v t 
an outcome in a coalitional game specifies the utilities 
the agents receive a solution concept assigns to each 
coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes different 
solution concepts attempt to capture in some way outcomes 
that are stable and or fair two of the best known solution 
concepts are the shapley value and the core 
the shapley value is a normative solution concept that 
prescribes a fair way to divide the gains from cooperation 
when the grand coalition is formed the division of payoff 
to agent i is the average marginal contribution of agent i 
over all possible permutations of the agents formally 
definition the shapley value of agent i φi v in game 
n v is given by the following formula 
φi v 
s⊆n\ i 
 s n − s − 
 n 
 v s ∪ i − v s 
 
the core is a descriptive solution concept that focuses on 
outcomes that are stable stability under core means that 
no set of players can jointly deviate to improve their payoffs 
definition an outcome x ∈ r n 
is in the core of the 
game n v if for all s ⊆ n 
i∈s 
xi ≥ v s 
note that the core of a game may be empty i e there may 
not exist any payoff vector that satisfies the stability 
requirement for the given game 
 computational problems 
we will study the following three problems related to 
solution concepts in coalitional games 
problem shapley value given a description of the 
coalitional game and an agent i compute the shapley value 
of agent i 
problem core membership given a description of 
the coalitional game and a payoff vector x such that 
è 
i∈n xi 
v n determine if 
è 
i∈s xi ≥ v s for all s ⊆ n 
problem core non-emptiness given a description 
of the coalitional game determine if there exists any payoff 
vector x such that 
è 
i∈s xi ≥ v s for all s ⊆ n andè 
i∈n xi v n 
note that the complexity of the above problems depends 
on the how the game is described all these problems will 
be easy if the game is described by its characteristic form 
but only so because the description takes space 
exponential in the number of agents and hence simple brute-force 
approach takes time polynomial to the input description 
to properly understand the computational complexity 
questions we have to look at compact representation 
 formal model 
in this section we will give a formal definition of 
multiattribute coalitional games and show how it is related to 
some of the representations discussed in the literature we 
will also discuss some limitations to our proposed approach 
 multi-attribute coalitional games 
a multi-attribute coalitional game macg consists of 
two parts a description of the attributes of the agents 
which we termed an attribute model and a function that 
assigns values to combination of attributes together they 
induce a coalitional game over the agents we first define 
the attribute model 
definition an attribute model is a tuple n m a where 
 n denotes the set of agents of size n 
 m denotes the set of attributes of size m 
 a ∈ rm×n 
 the attribute matrix describes the values 
of the attributes of the agents with aij denoting the 
value of attribute i for agent j 
we can directly define a function that maps combinations 
of attributes to real values however for many problems 
we can describe the function more compactly by computing 
it in two steps we first compute an aggregate value for 
each attribute then compute the values of combination of 
attributes using only the aggregated information formally 
definition an aggregating function or aggregator takes 
as input a row of the attribute matrix and a coalition s and 
summarizes the attributes of the agents in s with a single 
number we can treat it as a mapping from rn 
× n 
→ r 
aggregators often perform basic arithmetic or logical 
operations for example it may compute the sum of the 
attributes or evaluate a boolean expression by treating the 
agents i ∈ s as true and j ∈ s as false analogous to the 
notion of simple games we call an aggregator simple if its 
range is for any aggregator there is a set of relevant 
agents and a set of irrelevant agents an agent i is 
irrelevant to aggregator aj 
if aj 
 s ∪ i aj 
 s for all s ⊆ n 
a relevant agent is one not irrelevant 
given the attribute matrix an aggregator assigns a value 
to each coalition s ⊆ n thus each aggregator defines a 
game over n for aggregator aj 
 we refer to this induced 
game as the game of attribute j and denote it with aj 
 a 
when the attribute matrix is clear from the context we may 
drop a and simply denote the game as aj 
 we may refer to 
the game as the aggregator when no ambiguities arise 
we now define the second step of the computation with 
the help of aggregators 
definition an aggregate value function takes as input 
the values of the aggregators and maps these to a real value 
in this paper we will focus on having one aggregator per 
attribute therefore in what follows we will refer to the 
aggregate value function as a function over the attributes 
note that when all aggregators are simple the aggregate 
value function implicitly defines a game over the attributes 
as it assigns a value to each set of attributes t ⊆ m we 
refer to this as the game among attributes 
we now define multi-attribute coalitional game 
definition a multi-attribute coalitional game is defined 
by the tuple n m a a w where 
 n m a is an attribute model 
 a is a set of aggregators one for each attribute we can 
treat the set together as a vector function mapping 
rm×n 
× n 
→ rm 
 w rm 
→ r is an aggregate value function 
this induces a coalitional game with transferable payoffs 
n v with players n and the value function defined by 
v s w a a s 
note that macg as defined is fully capable of 
representing any coalitional game n v we can simply take the set 
of attributes as equal to the set of agents i e m n an 
identity matrix for a aggregators of sums and the 
aggregate value function w to be v 
 
 an example 
let us illustrate how macg can be used to represent a 
game with a simple example suppose there are four types 
of resources in the world gold silver copper and iron that 
each agent is endowed with some amount of these resources 
and there is a fixed price for each of the resources in the 
market this game can be described using macg with an 
attribute matrix a where aij denote the amount of resource 
i that agent j is endowed for each resource the 
aggregator sums together the amount of resources the agents have 
finally the aggregate value function takes the dot product 
between the market price vector and the aggregate vector 
note the inherent flexibility in the model only limited 
work would be required to update the game as the market 
price changes or when a new agent arrives 
 relationship with other representations 
as briefly discussed in section macg is closely related 
to two other representations in the literature the 
multiissue representation of conitzer and sandholm and our 
work on marginal contribution nets to make their 
relationships clear we first review these two representations 
we have changed the notations from the original papers to 
highlight their similarities 
definition a multi-issue representation is given as a 
vector of coalitional games v v vm each possibly 
with a varying set of agents say n nm the 
coalitional game n v induced by multi-issue representation has 
player set n 
ëm 
i ni and for each coalition s ⊆ n 
v s 
èm 
i v s ∩ ni the games vi are assumed to be 
represented in characteristic form 
definition a marginal contribution net is given as a 
set of rules r r rm where rule ri has a weight wi 
and a pattern pi that is a conjunction over literals 
 positive or negative the agents are represented as literals a 
coalition s is said to satisfy the pattern pi if we treat the 
agents i ∈ s as true an agent j ∈ s as false pi s 
evaluates to true denote the set of literals involved in rule i 
by ni the coalitional game n v induced by a marginal 
contribution net has player set n 
ëm 
i ni and for each 
coalition s ⊆ n v s 
è 
i pi s true wi 
from these definitions we can see the relationships among 
these three representations clearly an issue of a multi-issue 
representation corresponds to an attribute in macg 
similarly a rule of a marginal contribution net corresponds to 
an attribute in macg the aggregate value functions are 
simple sums and weighted sums for the respective 
representations therefore it is clear that macg will be no less 
succinct than either representation 
however macg differs in two important way firstly 
there is no restriction on the operations performed by the 
aggregate value function over the attributes this is an 
important generalization over the linear combination of issues 
or rules in the other two approaches in particular there are 
games for which macg can be exponentially more compact 
the proof of the following proposition can be found in the 
appendix 
proposition consider the parity game n v where 
coalition s ⊆ n has value v s if s is odd and v s 
 otherwise macg can represent the game in o n space 
both multi-issue representation and marginal contribution 
nets requires o n 
 space 
a second important difference of macg is that the 
attribute model and the value function is cleanly separated 
as suggested in the example in section this often 
allows us more efficient update of the values of the game as it 
changes also the same attribute model can be evaluated 
using different value functions and the same value function 
can be used to evaluate different attribute model therefore 
macg is very suitable for representing multiple games we 
believe the problems of updating games and representing 
multiple games are interesting future directions to explore 
 limitation of one aggregator per attribute 
before focusing on one aggregator per attribute for the 
rest of the paper it is natural to wonder if any is lost per 
such restriction the unfortunate answer is yes best 
illustrated by the following consider again the problem of 
forming a soccer team discussed in the introduction where 
we model the attributes of the agents as their ability to take 
the four positions of the field and the value of a team 
depends on the positions covered if we first aggregate each 
of the attribute individually we will lose the distributional 
information of the attributes in other words we will not 
be able to distinguish between two teams one of which has 
a player for each position the other has one player who can 
play all positions but the rest can only play the same one 
position 
this loss of distributional information can be recovered 
by using aggregators that take as input multiple rows of 
the attribute matrix rather than just a single row 
alternatively if we leave such attributes untouched we can leave 
the burden of correctly evaluating these attributes to the 
aggregate value function however for many problems that we 
found in the literature such as the transportation domain 
of and the flow game setting of the distribution of 
attributes does not affect the value of the coalitions in 
addition the problem may become unmanageably complex as 
we introduce more complicated aggregators therefore we 
will focus on the representation as defined in definition 
 shapley value 
in this section we focus on computational issues of 
finding the shapley value of a player in macg we first set 
up the problem with the use of oracles to avoid 
complexities arising from the aggregators we then show that when 
attributes are linearly separable the shapley value can be 
efficiently computed this generalizes the proofs of related 
results in the literature for the non-linearly separable case 
we consider a natural heuristic for estimating the shapley 
value and study the heuristic theoretically and empirically 
 problem setup 
we start by noting that computing the shapley value for 
simple aggregators can be hard in general in particular we 
can define aggregators to compute weighted majority over 
its input set of agents as noted in finding the shapley 
value of a weighted majority game is p-hard therefore 
discussion of complexity of shapley value for macg with 
unrestricted aggregators is moot 
instead of placing explicit restriction on the aggregator 
we assume that the shapley value of the aggregator can be 
 
answered by an oracle for notation let φi u denote the 
shapley value for some game u we make the following 
assumption 
assumption for each aggregator aj 
in a macg there 
is an associated oracle that answers the shapley value of the 
game of attribute j in other words φi aj 
 is known 
for many aggregators that perform basic operations over 
its input polynomial time oracle for shapley value exists 
this include operations such as sum and symmetric 
functions when the attributes are restricted to also when 
only few agents have an effect on the aggregator brute-force 
computation for shapley value is feasible therefore the 
above assumption is reasonable for many settings in any 
case such abstraction allows us to focus on the aggregate 
value function 
 linearly separable attributes 
when the aggregate value function can be written as a 
linear function of the attributes the shapley value of the 
game can be efficiently computed 
theorem given a game n v represented as a macg 
n m a a w if the aggregate value function can be 
written as a linear function of its attributes i e 
w a a s 
m 
j 
cj aj 
 a s 
the shapley value of agent i in n v is given by 
φi v 
m 
j 
cj φi aj 
 
proof first we note that shapley value satisfies an 
additivity axiom 
the shapley value satisfies additivity namely 
φi a b φi a φi b where n a b is 
a game defined to be a b s a s b s 
for all s ⊆ n 
it is also clear that shapley value satisfies scaling namely 
φi αv αφi v 
where αv s αv s for all s ⊆ n 
since the aggregate value function can be expressed as a 
weighted sum of games of attributes 
φi v φi w a φi 
m 
j 
cjaj 
 
m 
j 
cjφi aj 
 
many positive results regarding efficient computation of 
shapley value in the literature depends on some form of 
linearity examples include the edge-spanning game on graphs 
by deng and papadimitriou the multi-issue 
representation of and the marginal contribution nets of the 
key to determine if the shapley value can be efficiently 
computed depends on the linear separability of attributes once 
this is satisfied as long as the shapley value of the game of 
attributes can be efficiently determined the shapley value 
of the entire game can be efficiently computed 
corollary the shapley value for the edge-spanning 
game of games in multi-issue representation and 
games in marginal contribution nets can be computed in 
polynomial time 
 polynomial combination of attributes 
when the aggregate value function cannot be expressed 
as a linear function of its attributes computing the shapley 
value exactly is difficult here we will focus on aggregate 
value function that can be expressed as some polynomial 
of its attributes if we do not place a limit on the degree 
of the polynomial and the game n v is not necessarily 
monotonic the problem is p-hard 
theorem computing the shapley value of a macg 
n m a a w when w can be an arbitrary polynomial of 
the aggregates a is p-hard even when the shapley value 
of each aggregator can be efficiently computed 
the proof is via reduction from three-dimensional matching 
and details can be found in the appendix 
even if we restrict ourselves to monotonic games and 
non-negative coefficients for the polynomial aggregate value 
function computing the exact shapley value can still be 
hard for example suppose there are two attributes all 
agents in some set b ⊆ n possess the first attribute and all 
agents in some set c ⊆ n possess the second and b and c 
are disjoint for a coalition s ⊆ n the aggregator for the 
first evaluates to if and only if s ∩ b ≥ b and similarly 
the aggregator for the second evaluates to if and only if 
 s ∩ c ≥ c let the cardinality of the sets b and c be b 
and c we can verify that the shapley value of an agent i in 
b equals 
φi 
 
b 
b − 
i 
 b 
i 
 c 
c − 
 
 b c 
c i− 
 
c − c 
b c − c − i 
the equation corresponds to a weighted sum of probability 
values of hypergeometric random variables the 
correspondence with hypergeometric distribution is due to sampling 
without replacement nature of shapley value as far as we 
know there is no close-form formula to evaluate the sum 
above in addition as the number of attributes involved 
increases we move to multi-variate hypergeometric random 
variables and the number of summands grow exponentially 
in the number of attributes therefore it is highly unlikely 
that the exact shapley value can be determined efficiently 
therefore we look for approximation 
 approximation 
first we need a criteria for evaluating how well an 
estimate ˆφ approximates the true shapley value φ we 
consider the following three natural criteria 
 maximum underestimate maxi φi ˆφi 
 maximum overestimate maxi 
ˆφi φi 
 total variation 
 
è 
i φi − ˆφi or alternatively 
maxs 
è 
i∈s φi − 
è 
i∈s 
ˆφi 
the total variation criterion is more meaningful when we 
normalize the game to having a value of for the grand 
coalition i e v n we can also define additive 
analogues of the under- and overestimates especially when the 
games are normalized 
 
we will assume for now that the aggregate value 
function is a polynomial over the attributes with non-negative 
coefficients we will also assume that the aggregators are 
simple we will evaluate a specific heuristic that is 
analogous to equation suppose the aggregate function can 
be written as a polynomial with p terms 
w a a s 
p 
j 
cj aj 
 a s aj 
 a s · · · aj kj 
 a s 
 
for term j the coefficient of the term is cj its degree kj 
and the attributes involved in the term are j j kj 
we compute an estimate ˆφ to the shapley value as 
ˆφi 
p 
j 
kj 
l 
cj 
kj 
φi aj l 
 
the idea behind the estimate is that for each term we divide 
the value of the term equally among all its attributes this 
is represented by the factor 
cj 
kj 
 then for for each attribute 
of an agent we assign the player a share of value from the 
attribute this share is determined by the shapley value 
of the simple game of that attribute without considering 
the details of the simple games this constitutes a fair but 
blind rule of sharing 
 theoretical analysis of heuristic 
we can derive a simple and tight bound for the maximum 
 multiplicative underestimate of the heuristic estimate 
theorem given a game n v represented as a macg 
n m a a w suppose w can be expressed as a 
polynomial function of its attributes cf equation let k 
maxjkj i e the maximum degree of the polynomial let ˆφ 
denote the estimated shapley value using equation and 
φ denote the true shapley value for all i ∈ n φi ≥ k ˆφi 
proof we bound the maximum underestimate 
term-byterm let tj be the j-th term of the polynomial we note 
that the term can be treated as a game among attributes 
as it assigns a value to each coalition s ⊆ n without loss 
of generality renumber attributes j through j kj as 
through kj 
tj s cj 
kj 
l 
al 
 a s 
to make the equations less cluttered let 
b n s 
 s n − s − 
 n 
and for a game a contribution of agent i to group s i ∈ s 
∆i a s a s ∪ i − a s 
the true shapley value of the game tj is 
φi tj cj 
s⊆n\ i 
b n s ∆i tj s 
for each coalition s i ∈ s ∆i tj s if and only if for 
at least one attribute say l 
 ∆i al 
 s therefore if 
we sum over all the attributes we would have included l 
for sure 
φi tj ≤ cj 
kj 
j s⊆n\ i 
b n s ∆i aj 
 s 
 kj 
kj 
j 
cj 
kj 
φi aj 
 
 kj 
ˆφi t 
summing over the terms we see that the worst case 
underestimate is by the maximum degree 
without loss of generality since the bound is 
multiplicative we can normalize the game to having v n as a 
corollary because we cannot overestimate any set by more 
than k times we obtain a bound on the total variation 
corollary the total variation between the estimated 
shapley value and the true shapley value for k-degree bounded 
polynomial aggregate value function is k− 
k 
 
we can show that this bound is tight 
example consider a game with n players and k 
attributes let the first n− agents be a member of the first 
 k − attributes and that the corresponding aggregator 
returns if any one of the first k − agents is present 
let the n-th agent be the sole member of the k-th attribute 
the estimated shapley will assign a value of k− 
k 
 
n− 
to the 
first n − agents and 
k 
to the n-th agent however the 
true shapley value of the n-th agent tends to as n → ∞ 
and the total variation approaches k− 
k 
 
in general we cannot bound how much ˆφ may 
overestimate the true shapley value the problem is that ˆφi may 
be non-zero for agent i even though may have no influence 
over the outcome of a game when attributes are multiplied 
together as illustrated by the following example 
example consider a game with players and 
attributes and let the first agent be a member of both 
attributes and the other agent a member of the second 
attribute for a coalition s the first aggregator evaluates to 
 if agent ∈ s and the second aggregator evaluates to if 
both agents are in s while agent is not a dummy with 
respect to the second attribute it is a dummy with respect 
to the product of the attributes agent will be assigned a 
value of 
 
by the estimate 
as mentioned for simple monotonic games a game is fully 
described by its set of minimal winning coalitions when 
the simple aggregators are represented as such it is possible 
to check in polynomial time for agents turning dummies 
after attributes are multiplied together therefore we can 
improve the heuristic estimate in this special case 
 empirical evaluation 
due to a lack of benchmark problems for coalitional games 
we have tested the heuristic on random instances we 
believe more meaningful results can be obtained when we have

figure experimental results 
the number of attributes − and the maximum degree 
of the polynomial − for each attribute we randomly 
sample one to three minimal winning coalitions we then 
randomly generate a polynomial of the desired maximum 
degree with a random number − of terms each with 
a random positive weight we normalize each game to have 
v n the results of the experiments are shown in 
figure the y-axis of the graphs shows the total variation 
and the x-axis the number of players each datapoint is an 
average of approximately random samples 
figure a explores the effect of the maximum degree 
and the number of players when the number of attributes is 
fixed at six as expected the total variation increases as 
the maximum degree increases on the other hand there is 
only a very small increase in error as the number of players 
increases the error is nowhere near the theoretical 
worstcase bound of 
 
to 
 
for polynomials of degrees to 
figure b explores the effect of the number of attributes 
and the number of players when the maximum degree of the 
polynomial is fixed at three we first note that these three 
lines are quite tightly clustered together suggesting that the 
number of attributes has relatively little effect on the error 
of the estimate as the number of attributes increases the 
total variation decreases we think this is an interesting 
phenomenon this is probably due to the precise construct 
required for the worst-case bound and so as more attributes 
are available we have more diverse terms in the polynomial 
and the diversity pushes away from the worst-case bound 
 core-related questions 
in this section we look at the complexity of the two 
computational problems related to the core core 
nonemptiness and core membership we show that the 
nonemptiness of core of the game among attributes and the 
cores of the aggregators imply non-emptiness of the core of 
the game induced by the macg we also show that there 
appears to be no such general relationship that relates the 
core memberships of the game among attributes games of 
attributes and game induced by macg 
 problem setup 
there are many problems in the literature for which the 
questions of core non-emptiness and core 
membership are known to be hard for example for the 
edgespanning game that deng and papadimitriou studied 
both of these questions are conp-complete as macg can 
model the edge-spanning game in the same amount of space 
these hardness results hold for macg as well 
as in the case for computing shapley value we attempt 
to find a way around the hardness barrier by assuming the 
existence of oracles and try to build algorithms with these 
oracles first we consider the aggregate value function 
assumption for a macg n m a a w we assume 
there are oracles that answers the questions of core 
nonemptiness and core membership for the aggregate value 
function w 
when the aggregate value function is a non-negative linear 
function of its attributes the core is always non-empty and 
core membership can be determined efficiently 
the concept of core for the game among attributes makes 
the most sense when the aggregators are simple games we 
will further assume that these simple games are monotonic 
assumption for a macg n m a a w we assume 
all aggregators are monotonic and simple we also assume 
there are oracles that answers the questions of core 
nonemptiness and core membership for the aggregators 
we consider this a mild assumption recall that monotonic 
simple games are fully described by their set of minimal 
winning coalitions cf section if the aggregators are 
represented as such core non-emptiness and core 
membership can be checked in polynomial time this is due to the 
following well-known result regarding simple games 
lemma a simple game n v has a non-empty core 
if and only if it has a set of veto players say v such that 
v s for all s ⊇ v further a payoff vector x is in the 
core if and only if xi for all i ∈ v 
 core non-emptiness 
there is a strong connection between the non-emptiness 
of the cores of the games among attributes games of the 
attributes and the game induced by a macg 
theorem given a game n v represented as a macg 
n m a a w if the core of the game among attributes 
 
m w is non-empty and the cores of the games of 
attributes are non-empty then the core of n v is non-empty 
proof let u be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of 
the game among attributes m w for each attribute j 
let θj 
be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of the game 
of attribute j by lemma each attribute j must have a 
set of veto players let this set be denoted by pj 
 for each 
agent i ∈ n let yi 
è 
j ujθj 
i we claim that this vector y 
is in the core of n v consider any coalition s ⊆ n 
v s w a a s ≤ 
j s⊇p j 
uj 
this is true because an aggregator cannot evaluate to 
without all members of the veto set for any attribute j by 
lemma 
è 
i∈p j θj 
i therefore 
j s⊇p j 
uj 
j s⊇p j 
uj 
i∈p j 
θj 
i 
 
i∈s j s⊇p j 
ujθj 
i 
≤ 
i∈s 
yi 
note that the proof is constructive and hence if we are 
given an element in the core of the game among attributes 
we can construct an element of the core of the coalitional 
game from theorem we can obtain the following 
corollaries that have been previously shown in the literature 
corollary the core of the edge-spanning game of 
is non-empty when the edge weights are non-negative 
proof let the players be the vertices and their 
attributes the edges incident on them for each attribute 
there is a veto set - namely both endpoints of the edges 
as previously observed an aggregate value function that is a 
non-negative linear function of its aggregates has non-empty 
core therefore the precondition of theorem is satisfied 
and the edge-spanning game with non-negative edge weights 
has a non-empty core 
corollary theorem of the core of a flow 
game with committee control where each edge is controlled 
by a simple game with a veto set of players is non-empty 
proof we treat each edge of the flow game as an 
attribute and so each attribute has a veto set of players the 
core of a flow game without committee has been shown 
to be non-empty in we can again invoke theorem to 
show the non-emptiness of core for flow games with 
committee control 
however the core of the game induced by a macg may 
be non-empty even when the core of the game among 
attributes is empty as illustrated by the following example 
example suppose the minimal winning coalition of all 
aggregators in a macg n m a a w is n then v s 
for all coalitions s ⊂ n as long as v n ≥ any 
nonnegative vector x that satisfies 
è 
i∈n xi v n is in the 
core of n v 
complementary to the example above when all the 
aggregators have empty cores the core of n v is also empty 
theorem given a game n v represented as a macg 
n m a a w if the cores of all aggregators are empty 
v n and for each i ∈ n v i ≥ then the core of 
n v is empty 
proof suppose the core of n v is non-empty let x 
be a member of the core and pick an agent i such that xi 
 however for each attribute since the core is empty by 
lemma there are at least two disjoint winning coalitions 
pick the winning coalition sj 
that does not include i for 
each attribute j let s 
 
ë 
j sj 
 because s 
is winning 
for all coalitions v s 
 v n however 
v n 
j∈n 
xj xi 
j ∈n 
xj ≥ xi 
j∈s 
xj 
j∈s 
xj 
therefore v s 
 
è 
j∈s xj contradicting the fact that x 
is in the core of n v 
we do not have general results regarding the problem of 
core non-emptiness when some of the aggregators have 
non-empty cores while others have empty cores we suspect 
knowledge about the status of the cores of the aggregators 
alone is insufficient to decide this problem 
 core membership 
since it is possible for the game induced by the macg 
to have a non-empty core when the core of the aggregate 
value function is empty example we try to explore the 
problem of core membership assuming that the core of 
both the game among attributes m w and the underlying 
game n v is known to be non-empty and see if there 
is any relationship between their members one reasonable 
requirement is whether a payoff vector x in the core of n v 
can be decomposed and re-aggregated to a payoff vector y 
in the core of m w formally 
definition we say that a vector x ∈ rn 
≥ can be 
decomposed and re-aggregated into a vector y ∈ rm 
≥ if there 
exists z ∈ rm×n 
≥ such that 
yi 
n 
j 
zij for all i 
xj 
m 
i 
zij for all j 
we may refer z as shares 
when there is no restriction on the entries of z it is 
always possible to decompose a payoff vector x in the core of 
n v to a payoff vector y in the core of m w however it 
seems reasonable to restrict that if an agent j is irrelevant to 
the aggregator i i e i never changes the outcome of 
aggregator j then zij should be restricted to be unfortunately 
this restriction is already too strong 
example consider a macg n m a a w with two 
players and three attributes suppose agent is irrelevant 
to attribute and agent is irrelevant to attributes and 
 for any set of attributes t ⊆ m let w be defined as 
w t 
 if t or 
 if t 
 if t 
 
since the core of a game with a finite number of players forms 
a polytope we can verify that the set of vectors 
 and fully characterize the core c of m w 
on the other hand the vector is in the core of n v 
this vector cannot be decomposed and re-aggregated to a 
vector in c under the stated restriction 
because of the apparent lack of relationship among 
members of the core of n v and that of m w we believe an 
algorithm for testing core membership will require more 
input than just the veto sets of the aggregators and the 
oracle of core membership for the aggregate value function 
 concluding remarks 
multi-attribute coalitional games constitute a very 
natural way of modeling problems of interest its space 
requirement compares favorably with other representations 
discussed in the literature and hence it serves well as a 
prototype to study computational complexity of coalitional 
game theory for a variety of problems positive results 
obtained under this representation can easily be translated to 
results about other representations some of these corollary 
results have been discussed in sections and 
an important direction to explore in the future is the 
question of efficiency in updating a game and how to 
evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch as 
pointed out at the end of section macg is very 
naturally suited for updates representation results regarding 
efficiency of updates and algorithmic results regarding how 
to compute the different solution concepts from updates will 
both be very interesting 
our work on approximating the shapley value when the 
aggregate value function is a non-linear function of the 
attributes suggests more work to be done there as well given 
the natural probabilistic interpretation of the shapley value 
we believe that a random sampling approach may have 
significantly better theoretical guarantees

appendix 
we complete the missing proofs from the main text here 
to prove proposition we need the following lemma 
lemma marginal contribution nets when all coalitions 
are restricted to have values or have the same 
representation power as an and or circuit with negation at the 
literal level i e ac 
circuit of depth two 
proof if a rule assigns a negative value in the marginal 
contribution nets we can write the rule by a corresponding 
set of at most n rules where n is the number of agents such 
that each of which has positive values through application of 
de morgan s law with all values of the rules non-negative 
we can treat the weighted summation step of marginal 
contribution nets can be viewed as an or and each rule as 
a conjunction over literals possibly negated this exactly 
match up with an and or circuit of depth two 
proof proposition the parity game can be 
represented with a macg using a single attribute aggregator 
of sum and an aggregate value function that evaluates that 
sum modulus two 
as a boolean function parity is known to require an 
exponential number of prime implicants by lemma a prime 
implicant is the exact analogue of a pattern in a rule of 
marginal contribution nets therefore to represent the parity 
function a marginal contribution nets must be an 
exponential number of rules 
finally as shown in a marginal contribution net is at 
worst a factor of o n less compact than multi-issue 
representation therefore multi-issue representation will also 
 
take exponential space to represent the parity game this 
is assuming that each issue in the game is represented in 
characteristic form 
proof theorem an instance of three-dimensional 
matching is as follows given set p ⊆ w × x × y 
where w x y are disjoint sets having the same number q 
of elements does there exist a matching p ⊆ p such that 
 p q and no two elements of p agree in any 
coordinate for notation let p p p pk we construct 
a macg n m a a w as follows 
 m let attributes to q correspond to elements in w 
 q to q correspond to elements in x q to q 
corresponds to element in y and let there be a special 
attribute q 
 n let player i corresponds to pi and let there be a 
special player 
 a let aji if the element corresponding to 
attribute j is in pi thus for the first k columns there 
are exactly three non-zero entries we also set 
a q 
 a for each aggregator j aj 
 a s if and only if 
sum of row j of a s equals 
 w product over all aj 
 
in the game n v that corresponds to this construction 
v s if and only if all attributes are covered exactly 
once therefore for ∈ t ⊆ n v t ∪ − v t if 
and only if t covers attributes to q exactly once since 
all such t if exists must be of size q the number of 
threedimensional matchings is given by 
φ v 
 k 
q k − q
