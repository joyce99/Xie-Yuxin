abstract 
in this paper we examine the relative forecast accuracy of 
information markets versus expert aggregation we 
leverage a unique data source of almost people s subjective 
probability judgments on us national football league 
games and compare with the market probabilities given 
by two different information markets on exactly the same 
events we combine assessments of multiple experts via 
linear and logarithmic aggregation functions to form pooled 
predictions prices in information markets are used to 
derive market predictions our results show that at the same 
time point ahead of the game information markets provide 
as accurate predictions as pooled expert assessments in 
screening pooled expert predictions we find that arithmetic 
average is a robust and efficient pooling function 
weighting expert assessments according to their past performance 
does not improve accuracy of pooled predictions and

 introduction 
forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies 
for decades scientists have been developing and exploring 
various forecasting methods which can be roughly divided 
into statistical and non-statistical approaches statistical 
approaches require not only the existence of enough 
historical data but also that past data contains valuable 
information about the future event when these conditions can 
not be met non-statistical approaches that rely on 
judgmental information about the future event could be better 
choices one widely used non-statistical method is to elicit 
opinions from experts since experts are not generally in 
agreement many belief aggregation methods have been 
proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a 
single prediction these belief aggregation methods are called 
opinion pools which have been extensively studied in 
statistics and management sciences and 
applied in many domains such as group decision making 
and risk analysis 
with the fast growth of the internet information markets 
have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical 
forecasting tool information markets sometimes called 
prediction markets idea markets or event markets are 
markets designed for aggregating information and making 
predictions about future events to form the predictions 
information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of 
events for example in an information market to predict 
the result of a us professional national football league 
 nfl game say new england vs carolina the security 
pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if 
and only if new england wins the game otherwise it pays 
off nothing the security price before the game reflects the 
consensus expectation of market traders about the 
probability of new england winning the game such markets 
are becoming very popular the iowa electronic markets 
 iem are real-money futures markets to predict 
economic and political events such as elections the 
hollywood stock exchange hsx is a virtual play-money 
exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office 
proceeds of new movies and the outcomes of entertainment 
awards etc tradesports com a real-money betting 
exchange registered in ireland hosts markets for sports 
political entertainment and financial events the foresight 
exchange fx allows traders to wager play money on 
unresolved scientific questions or other claims of public 
interest and newsfutures com s world news exchange has 
 
popular sports and financial betting markets also grounded 
in a play-money currency 
despite the popularity of information markets one of the 
most important questions to ask is how accurately can 
information markets predict previous research in general 
shows that information markets are remarkably accurate 
the political election markets at iem predict the election 
outcomes better than polls prices in hsx 
and fx have been found to give as accurate or more 
accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts 
 however information markets have not been 
calibrated against opinion pools except for servan-schreiber 
et al in which the authors compare two information 
markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions since 
information markets in nature offer an adaptive and 
selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market 
participants it is interesting to compare them with existing 
opinion pooling methods to evaluate the performance of 
information markets from another perspective the 
comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to 
choose the most appropriate method for their needs 
this paper contributes to the literature in two ways 
as an initial attempt to compare information markets with 
opinion pools of multiple experts it leads to a better 
understanding of information markets and their promise as an 
alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts 
in screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison we 
cast insights into relative performances of different opinion 
pools in terms of prediction accuracy we compare two 
information markets with several linear and logarithmic 
opinion pools linop and logop at predicting the results of 
nfl games our results show that at the same time point 
ahead of the game information markets provide as accurate 
predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools in 
selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison we 
find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling 
function weighting expert assessments according to their 
past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy 
of opinion pools and logop offers bolder predictions than 
linop the remainder of the paper is organized as follows 
section reviews popular opinion pooling methods 
section introduces the basics of information markets data 
sets and our analysis methods are described in section 
we present results and analysis in section followed by 
conclusions in section 
 review of opinion pools 
clemen and winkler classify opinion pooling 
methods into two broad categories mathematical approaches 
and behavioral approaches in mathematical approaches 
the opinions of individual experts are expressed as 
subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an 
uncertain event they are combined through various 
mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability 
distribution genest and zidek and french provide 
comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches mathematical 
approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic 
approaches and bayesian approaches axiomatic approaches 
apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions 
expressed as a set of individual probability distributions to 
a single aggregated probability distribution these 
pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable 
properties two of the most common pooling functions are 
the linear opinion pool linop and the logarithmic opinion 
pool logop using linop the aggregate probability 
distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual 
probability distributions 
p θ 
n 
i 
wipi θ 
where pi θ is expert i s probability distribution of uncertain 
event θ p θ represents the aggregate probability 
distribution wi s are weights for experts which are usually 
nonnegative and sum to and n is the number of experts using 
logop the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted 
geometric mean of individual probability distributions 
p θ k 
n 
i 
pi θ wi 
 
where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled 
opinion is a probability distribution other axiomatic 
pooling methods often are extensions of linop logop 
or both winkler and morris establish the 
early framework of bayesian aggregation methods bayesian 
approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a 
prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood 
function over expert opinions given the event this decision 
maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its 
priors over the event and opinions according to bayes rule the 
resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled 
opinion 
behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the 
field of group decision making and organizational 
behavior the important assumption of behavioral approaches is 
that through exchanging opinions or information experts 
can eventually reach an equilibrium where further 
interaction won t change their opinions one of the best known 
behavioral approaches is the delphi technique 
typically this method and its variants do not allow open 
discussion but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other 
experts and is given feedback experts then can reassess 
their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a 
smaller spread of opinions is achieved some other 
behavioral methods such as the nominal group technique 
promote open discussions in controlled environments 
each approach has its pros and cons axiomatic 
approaches are easy to use but they don t have a normative 
basis to choose weights in addition several impossibility 
results e g genest show that no aggregation 
function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool 
unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual 
opinion which effectively implies a dictator bayesian 
approaches are nicely based on the normative bayesian 
framework however it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to 
apply because it requires either constructing an obscenely 
complex joint prior over the event and opinions often 
impractical even in terms of storage space complexity not 
to mention from an elicitation standpoint or making 
strong assumptions about the prior like conditional 
independence of experts behavior approaches allow experts to 
dynamically improve their information and revise their 
opinions during interactions but many of them are not fixed or 
completely specified and can t guarantee convergence or 
repeatability 
 
 how information markets work 
much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems 
from hayek hypothesis and efficient market 
hypothesis hayek in his classic critique of central planning in 
 s claims that the price system in a competitive market 
is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed 
information among market participants the efficient market 
hypothesis further states that in an efficient market the 
price of a security almost instantly incorporates all 
available information the market price summarizes all relevant 
information across traders hence is the market participants 
consensus expectation about the future value of the security 
empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large 
extent thus when associating the value of a 
security with the outcome of an uncertain future event market 
price by revealing the consensus expectation of the security 
value can indirectly predict the outcome of the event this 
idea gives rise to information markets 
for example if we want to predict which team will win 
the nfl game between new england and carolina an 
information market can trade a security if new england 
defeats carolina whose payoff per share at the end of the 
game is specified as follow 
 if new england wins the game 
 otherwise 
the security price should roughly equal the expected payoff 
of the security in an efficient market the time value of 
money usually can be ignored because durations of most 
information markets are short assuming exposure to risk is 
roughly equal for both outcomes or that there are sufficient 
effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market the price 
should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players 
in the market thus 
p pr patriots win × − pr patriots win × 
where p is the price of the security if new england 
defeats carolina and pr patriots win is the probability 
that new england will win the game observing the security 
price p before the game we can derive pr patriots win 
which is the market participants collective prediction about 
how likely it is that new england will win the game 
the above security is a winner-takes-all contract it is 
used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random 
variable with disjoint outcomes in this case binary its 
price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be 
realized when the outcome of a prediction problem can be 
any value in a continuous interval we can design a security 
that pays its holder proportional to the realized value this 
kind of security is what wolfers and zitzewitz called 
an index contract it predicts the expected value of a 
future outcome many other aspects of a future event such as 
median value of outcome can also be predicted in 
information markets by designing and trading different securities 
wolfers and zitzewitz provide a summary of the main 
types of securities traded in information markets and what 
statistical properties they can predict in practice 
conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the 
many decisions in designing an effective information 
market spann and skiera propose an initial framework for 
designing information markets 
 design of analysis 
 data sets 
our data sets cover nfl games held between 
september th and december th nfl games are 
very suitable for our purposes because two online 
exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that 
provide data on both information markets and the 
opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games 
the popularity of nfl games in the united states provides 
natural incentives for people to participate in information 
markets and or the contest which increases liquidity of 
information markets and improves the quality and number 
of opinions in the contest intense media coverage and 
analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and 
individual players provide the public with much information so that 
participants of information markets and the contest can be 
viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal 
information market data was acquired by using a 
specially designed crawler program from tradesports com s 
football-nfl markets and newsfutures com s sports 
exchange for each nfl game both tradesports and 
newsfutures have a winner-takes-all information market to 
predict the game outcome we introduce the design of the 
two markets according to spann and skiera s three steps for 
designing an information market as below 
 choice of forecasting goal markets at both 
tradesports and newsfutures aim at predicting which one 
of the two teams will win a nfl football game they 
trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 
 if a team wins the game and if it loses the game 
small differences exist in how they deal with ties in 
the case of a tie tradesports will unwind all trades 
that occurred and refund all exchange fees but the 
security is worth in newsfutures since the 
probability of a tie is usually very low much less the 
prices at both markets effectively represent the market 
participants consensus assessment of the probability 
that the team will win 
 incentive for participation and information 
revelation tradesports and newsfutures use different 
incentives for participation and information revelation 
tradesports is a real-money exchange a trader needs 
to open and fund an account with a minimum of 
to participate in the market both profits and losses 
can occur as a result of trading activity on the 
contrary a trader can register at newsfutures for free and 
get units of sport exchange virtual money at the 
time of registration traders at newsfutures will not 
incur any real financial loss they can accumulate 
virtual money by trading securities the virtual money 
can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at 
newsfutures online shop 
 financial market design both markets at 
tradesports and newsfutures use the continuous double 
auction as their trading mechanism tradesports charges 
a small fee on each security transaction and expiry 
while newsfutures does not 
we can see that the main difference between two information 
markets is real money vs virtual money servan-schreiber 
 
et al have compared the effect of money on the 
performance of the two information markets and concluded that 
the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the 
same level not intending to compare these two markets 
we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our 
findings are not accidental 
we obtain the opinions of self-identified experts for 
nfl games from the probabilityfootball online contest 
one of several probabilitysports contests the contest is 
free to enter participants of the contest are asked to enter 
their subjective probability that a team will win a game 
by noon on the day of the game importantly the contest 
evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic 
scoring rule 
s − × prob lose 
 
where s represents the score that a participant earns for the 
game and prob lose is the probability that the participant 
assigns to the actual losing team the quadratic score is 
one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have 
the property that an expert s expected score is maximized 
when the expert reports probabilities truthfully for 
example for a game team a vs team b if a player assigns to 
both team a and b his her score for the game is no matter 
which team wins if he she assigns to team a and to 
team b showing that he is confident in team a s winning 
he she will score points for the game if team a wins and 
lose points if team b wins this quadratic scoring rule 
rewards bold predictions that are right but penalizes bold 
predictions that turn out to be wrong the top players 
measured by accumulated scores over all games win the prizes 
of the contest the suggested strategy at the contest 
website is to make picks for each game that match as closely 
as possible the probabilities that each team will win this 
strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize 
expected score however as prizes are awarded only to the top 
few winners participants goals are to maximize the 
probability of winning not maximize expected score resulting in a 
slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization 
still 
as far as we are aware this data offer the closest thing 
available to true subjective probability judgments from so many 
people over so many public events that have corresponding 
information markets 
 methods of analysis 
in order to compare the prediction accuracy of 
information markets and that of opinion pools we proceed to derive 
predictions from market data of tradesports and 
newsfutures form pooled opinions using expert data from 
probabilityfootball contest and specify the performance measures 
to be used 
 deriving predictions 
for information markets deriving predictions is 
straightforward we can take the security price and divide it by 
 to get the market s prediction of the probability that 
a team will win to match the time when participants at 
the probabilityfootball contest are required to report their 
probability assessments we derive predictions using the last 
trade price before noon on the day of the game for more 
 
ideally prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion 
to accumulated score 
than half of the games this time is only about an hour 
earlier than the game starting time while it is several hours 
earlier for other games two sets of market predictions are 
derived 
 nf prediction equals newsfutures last trade price 
before noon of the game day divided by 
 ts prediction equals tradesports last trade price 
before noon of the game day divided by 
we apply linop and logop to probabilityfootball data 
to obtain aggregate expert predictions the reason that we 
do not consider other aggregation methods include data 
from probabilityfootball is only suitable for mathematical 
pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches 
 bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions 
about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes 
and the likelihood function of expert opinions given the 
large number of games and participants making reasonable 
assumptions is difficult and for axiomatic approaches 
previous research has shown that simpler aggregation 
methods often perform better than more complex methods 
because the output of logop is indeterminate if there are 
probability assessments of both and and because 
assessments of and are dictatorial using logop we add 
a small number to an expert opinion if it is and 
subtract from it if it is 
in pooling opinions we consider two influencing factors 
weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be 
pooled for weights of experts we experiment with equal 
weights and performance-based weights the 
performancebased weights are determined according to previous 
accumulated score in the contest the score for each game is 
calculated according to equation the scoring rule used in 
the probabilityfootball contest for the first week since no 
previous scores are available we choose equal weights for 
later weeks we calculate accumulated past scores for each 
player because the cumulative scores can be negative we 
shift everyone s score if needed to ensure the weights are 
non-negative thus 
wi 
cumulative scorei shift 
n 
j cumulative scorej shift 
 
where shift equals if the smallest cumulative scorej is 
non-negative and equals the absolute value of the 
smallest cumulative scorej otherwise for simplicity we call 
performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted and equally 
weighted opinion pool as unweighted we will use them 
interchangeably in the remaining of the paper 
as for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool 
we form different opinion pools with different number of 
experts only the best performing experts are selected for 
example to form an opinion pool with expert opinions 
we choose the top participants since there is no 
performance record for the first week we use opinions of all 
participants in the first week for week we select opinions of 
 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the 
top for week individuals whose cumulative scores 
of week and are among the top s are selected experts 
are chosen in a similar way for later weeks thus the top 
 participants can change from week to week 
the possible opinion pools varied in pooling functions 
weighting methods and number of expert opinions are shown

we use u to symbolize unweighted equally weighted

opinion pools lin-all-u the equally weighted linop with 
all participants is basically the arithmetic mean of all 
participants opinions log-all-u is simply the geometric mean 
of all opinions 
when a participant did not enter a prediction for a 
particular game that participant was removed from the opinion 
pool for that game this contrasts with the 
probabilityfootball average reported on the contest website and used 
by servan-schreiber et al where unreported 
predictions were converted to probability predictions 
 performance measures 
we use three common metrics to assess prediction 
accuracy of information markets and opinion pools these 
measures have been used by servan-schreiber et al in 
evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets 
 absolute error prob lose 
where prob lose is the probability assigned to the 
eventual losing team absolute error simply measures 
the difference between a perfect prediction for 
winning team and the actual prediction a prediction 
with lower absolute error is more accurate 
 quadratic score − × prob lose 
 
quadratic score is the scoring function that is used in 
the probabilityfootball contest it is a linear 
transformation of squared error prob lose 
 which is one of 
the mostly used metrics in evaluating forecasting 
accuracy quadratic score can be negative a prediction 
with higher quadratic score is more accurate 
 logarithmic score log prob w in 
where prob w in is the probability assigned to the 
eventual winning team the logarithmic score like 
the quadratic score is a proper scoring rule a 
prediction with higher less negative logarithmic score is 
more accurate 
 empirical results 
 performance of opinion pools 
depending on how many opinions are used there can be 
numerous different opinion pools we first examine the 
effect of number of opinions on prediction accuracy by forming 
opinion pools with the number of expert opinions varying 
from to in the probabilityfootball competition not 
all registered participants provide their probability 
assessments for every game is the smallest number of 
participants for all games for each game we sort experts 
according to their accumulated quadratic score in previous 
weeks predictions of the best performing n participants are 
picked to form an opinion pool with n experts 
figure shows the prediction accuracy of linop and 
logop in terms of mean values of the three performance 
measures across all games we can see the following trends 
in the figure 
 unweighted opinion pools and performance-weighted 
opinion pools have similar levels of prediction 
accuracy especially for linop 
 for linop increasing the number of experts in 
general increases or keeps the same the level of prediction 
accuracy when there are more than experts the 
prediction accuracy of linop is stable regarding the 
number of experts 
 logop seems more accurate than linop in terms of 
mean absolute error but using all other performance 
measures linop outperforms logop 
 for logop increasing the number of experts increases 
the prediction accuracy at the beginning but the 
curves including the points with all experts for mean 
quadratic score and mean logarithmic score have slight 
bell-shapes which represent a decrease in prediction 
accuracy when the number of experts is very large 
the curves for mean absolute error on the other hand 
show a consistent increase of accuracy 
the first and second trend above imply that when using 
linop the simplest way which has good prediction 
accuracy is to average the opinions of all experts weighting 
does not seem to improve performance selecting experts 
according to past performance also does not help it is a 
very interesting observation that even if many participants 
of the probabilityfootball contest do not provide accurate 
individual predictions they have negative quadratic scores 
in the contest including their opinions into the opinion pool 
still increases the prediction accuracy one explanation of 
this phenomena could be that biases of individual judgment 
can offset with each other when opinions are diverse which 
makes the pooled prediction more accurate 
the third trend presents a controversy the relative 
prediction accuracy of logop and linop flips when using 
different accuracy measures to investigate this disagreement 
we plot the absolute error of log-all-u and lin-all-u for each 
game in figure when the absolute error of an opinion

figure prediction accuracy of opinion pools 
pool for a game is less than it means that the team 
favored by the opinion pool wins the game if it is greater than 
 the underdog wins compared with lin-all-u log-all-u 
has lower absolute error when it is less than and greater 
absoluter error when it is greater than which indicates 
that predictions of log-all-u are bolder more close to or 
than those of lin-all-u this is due to the nature of linear 
and logarithmic aggregating functions because quadratic 
score and logarithmic score penalize bold predictions that 
are wrong logop is less accurate when measured in these 
terms 
similar reasoning accounts for the fourth trend when 
there are more than experts increasing number of 
experts used in logop improves the prediction accuracy 
measured by absolute error but worsens the accuracy measured 
by the other two metrics examining expert opinions we 
find that participants who rank lower are more frequent in 
offering extreme predictions or than those ranking high 
in the list when we increase the number of experts in an 
opinion pool we are incorporating more extreme predictions 
into it the resulting logop is bolder and hence has lower 
mean quadratic score and mean logarithmic score 
 comparison of information markets and 
opinion pools 
through the first screening of various opinion pools we 
select lin-all-u log-all-u log-all-w and log- -u to 
compare with predictions from information markets lin-all-u 
as shown in figure can represent what linop can achieve 
however the performance of logop is not consistent when 
evaluated using different metrics log-all-u and log-all-w 
offer either the best or the worst predictions log- -u the 
logop with the top performing experts provides more 
stable predictions we use all of the three to stand for the 
performance of logop in our later comparison

game either from an opinion pool or an information 
market is higher than we say that the team is the predicted

day information markets and opinion pools have 
comparable potential at the same time point 
we then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of 
information markets and opinion pools using the three 
performance measures table displays mean values of these 
measures over games numbers in parentheses are 
standard errors which estimate the standard deviation of the 
mean to take into consideration of skewness of 
distributions we also report median values of accuracy measures in 
table judged by the mean values of accuracy measures 
in table all methods have similar accuracy levels with 
nf and ts slightly better than the opinion pools however 
the median values of accuracy measures indicate that 
logall-u and log-all-w opinion pools are more accurate than 
all other predictions 
we employ the randomization test to study whether 
the differences in prediction accuracy presented in table 
and table are statistically significant the basic idea of 
randomization test is that by randomly swapping 
predictions of two methods numerous times an empirical 
distribution for the difference of prediction accuracy can be 
constructed using this empirical distribution we are then able 
to evaluate that at what confidence level the observed 
difference reflects a real difference for example the mean 
absolute error of nf is higher than that of log-all-u by 
 as shown in table to test whether this 
difference is statistically significant we shuﬄe predictions from 
two methods randomly label half of predictions as nf and 
the other half as log-all-u and compute the difference of 
mean absolute error of the newly formed nf and log-all-u 
data the above procedure is repeated times the 
 differences of mean absolute error results in an 
empirical distribution of the difference comparing our observed 
difference with this distribution we find that the 
observed difference is greater than of the empirical 
differences this leads us to conclude that the difference of 
mean absolute error between nf and log-all-u is not 
statistically significant if we choose the level of significance to 
be 
table and table are results of randomization test for 
mean and median differences respectively each cell of the 
table is for two different prediction methods represented by

comes to median values of prediction accuracy log-all-u 
outperforms lin-all-u at a high confidence level 
these results indicate that differences in prediction 
accuracy between information markets and opinion pools are not 
statistically significant this may seem to contradict the 
result of servan-schreiber et al in which newsfutures s 
information markets have been shown to provide 
statistically significantly more accurate predictions than the 
 unweighted average of all probabilityfootball opinions the 
discrepancy emerges in dealing with missing data not all 
 registered probabilityfootball participants offer 
probability assessments for each game when a participant does 
not provide a probability assessment for a game the 
contest considers their prediction as this makes sense in 
the context of the contest since always yields quadratic 
score the probabilityfootball average reported on the 
contest website and used by servan-schreiber et al includes 
these estimates instead we remove participants from 
games that they do not provide assessments pooling only 
the available opinions together our treatment increases the 
prediction accuracy of lin-all-u significantly 
 conclusions 
with the fast growth of the internet information markets 
have recently emerged as an alternative tool for predicting 
future events previous research has shown that information 
markets give as accurate or more accurate predictions than 
individual experts and polls however information 
markets as an adaptive mechanism to aggregate different 
opinions of market participants have not been calibrated against 
many belief aggregation methods in this paper we compare 
prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and 
logarithmic opinion pools linop and logop using 
predictions from two markets and individuals regarding the 
outcomes of american football games during the 
nfl season in screening for representative opinion pools to 
compare with information markets we investigate the effect 
of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy 
our results on both the comparison of information markets 
and opinion pools and the relative performance of different 
opinion pools are summarized as below 
 at the same time point ahead of the events 
information markets offer as accurate predictions as our 
selected opinion pools 
we have selected four opinion pools to represent the 
prediction accuracy level that linop and logop can 
achieve with all four performance metrics our two 
information markets obtain similar prediction accuracy 
as the four opinion pools

 in each table cell row accounts for absolute error row for quadratic score

 confidence above is shown in bold 
 the arithmetic average of all opinions lin-all-u is a 
simple robust and efficient opinion pool 
simply averaging across all experts seems resulting in 
better predictions than individual opinions and 
opinion pools with a few experts it is quite robust in the 
sense that even if the included individual predictions 
are less accurate averaging over all opinions still gives 
better or equally good predictions 
 weighting expert opinions according to past 
performance does not seem to significantly improve 
prediction accuracy of either linop or logop 
comparing performance-weighted opinion pools with 
equally weighted opinion pools we do not observe much 
difference in terms of prediction accuracy since we 
only use one performance-weighting method 
calculating the weights according to past accumulated quadratic 
score that participants earned this might due to the 
weighting method we chose 
 logop yields bolder predictions than linop 
logop yields predictions that are closer to the 
extremes or 
an information markets is a self-organizing mechanism 
for aggregating information and making predictions 
compared with opinion pools it is less constrained by space 
and time and can eliminate the efforts to identify experts 
and decide belief aggregation methods but the advantages 
do not compromise their prediction accuracy to any extent 
on the contrary information markets can provide real-time 
predictions which are hardly achievable through resorting 
to experts in the future we are interested in further 
exploring 
 performance comparison of information markets with 
other opinion pools and mathematical aggregation 
procedures 
in this paper we only compare information markets 
with two simple opinion pools linear and logarithmic 
it will be meaningful to investigate their relative 
prediction accuracy with other belief aggregation methods 
such as bayesian approaches there are also a number 
of theoretical expert algorithms with proven worst-case 
performance bounds whose average-case or 
practical performance would be instructive to investigate 
 whether defining expertise more narrowly can improve 
predictions of opinion pools 
in our analysis we broadly treat participants of the 
probabilityfootball contest as experts in all games if 
we define expertise more narrowly selecting experts 
in certain football teams to predict games involving 
these teams will the predictions of opinion pools be 
more accurate 
 the possibility of combining information markets with 
other forecasting methods to achieve better prediction 
accuracy 
chen fine and huberman use an information 
market to determine the risk attitude of participants 
and then perform a nonlinear aggregation of their 
predictions based on their risk attitudes the nonlinear 
aggregation mechanism is shown to outperform both 
the market and the best individual participants it 
is worthy of more attention whether information 
markets as an alternative forecasting method can be used 
together with other methods to improve our 
predictions
