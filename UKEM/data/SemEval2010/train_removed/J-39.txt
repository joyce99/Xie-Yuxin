abstract 
bidders on ebay have no dominant bidding strategy when 
faced with multiple auctions each offering an item of 
interest as seen through an analysis of auctions on 
ebay for a dell e fp lcd monitor some bidders win 
auctions at prices higher than those of other available 
auctions while others never win an auction despite placing bids 
in losing efforts that are greater than the closing prices of 
other available auctions these misqueues in strategic 
behavior hamper the efficiency of the system and in so doing 
limit the revenue potential for sellers this paper proposes a 
novel options-based extension to ebay s proxy-bidding 
system that resolves this strategic issue for buyers in 
commoditized markets an empirical analysis of ebay provides a 
basis for computer simulations that investigate the market 
effects of the options-based scheme and demonstrates that 
the options-based scheme provides greater efficiency than 
ebay while also increasing seller revenue

 introduction 
electronic markets represent an application of information 
systems that has generated significant new trading 
opportunities while allowing for the dynamic pricing of goods in 
addition to marketplaces such as ebay electronic marketplaces 
are increasingly used for business-to-consumer auctions e g 
to sell surplus inventory 
many authors have written about a future in which 
commerce is mediated by online automated trading agents 
 there is still little evidence of automated trading 
in e-markets though we believe that one leading place of 
resistance is in the lack of provably optimal bidding 
strategies for any but the simplest of market designs without 
this we do not expect individual consumers or firms to 
be confident in placing their business in the hands of an 
automated agent 
one of the most common examples today of an electronic 
marketplace is ebay where the gross merchandise volume 
 i e the sum of all successfully closed listings during 
was b among items listed on ebay many are essentially 
identical this is especially true in the consumer 
electronics category which accounted for roughly b of ebay s 
gross merchandise volume in this presence of 
essentially identical items can expose bidders and sellers to risks 
because of the sequential auction problem 
for example alice may want an lcd monitor and could 
potentially bid in either a o clock or o clock ebay 
auction while alice would prefer to participate in whichever 
auction will have the lower winning price she cannot 
determine beforehand which auction that may be and could 
end up winning the wrong auction this is a problem of 
multiple copies 
another problem bidders may face is the exposure 
problem as investigated by bykowsky et al exposure 
problems exist when buyers desire a bundle of goods but may 
only participate in single-item auctions 
for example if 
alice values a video game console by itself for a video 
game by itself for and both a console and game for 
alice must determine how much of the of synergy value 
she might include in her bid for the console alone both 
problems arise in ebay as a result of sequential auctions of 
single items coupled with patient bidders with substitutes 
or complementary valuations 
why might the sequential auction problem be bad 
complex games may lead to bidders employing costly strategies 
and making mistakes potential bidders who do not wish 
to bear such costs may choose not to participate in the 
 
the exposure problem has been primarily investigated by 
bykowsky et al in the context of simultaneous single-item 
auctions the problem is also a familiar one of online 
decision making 
 
market inhibiting seller revenue opportunities 
additionally among those bidders who do choose to participate the 
mistakes made may lead to inefficient allocations further 
limiting revenue opportunities 
we are interested in creating modifications to ebay-style 
markets that simplify the bidder problem leading to simple 
equilibrium strategies and preferably better efficiency and 
revenue properties 
 options proxies a proposed solution 
retail stores have developed policies to assist their 
customers in addressing sequential purchasing problems 
return policies alleviate the exposure problem by allowing 
customers to return goods at the purchase price price 
matching alleviates the multiple copies problem by allowing buyers 
to receive from sellers after purchase the difference between 
the price paid for a good and a lower price found elsewhere 
for the same good furthermore price matching 
can reduce the impact of exactly when a seller brings an 
item to market as the price will in part be set by others 
selling the same item these two retail policies provide the 
basis for the scheme proposed in this paper 
we extend the proxy bidding technology currently 
employed by ebay our super-proxy extension will take 
advantage of a new real options-based market infrastructure 
that enables simple yet optimal bidding strategies the 
extensions are computationally simple handle temporal 
issues and retain seller autonomy in deciding when to enter 
the market and conduct individual auctions 
a seller sells an option for a good which will ultimately 
lead to either a sale of the good or the return of the option 
buyers interact through a proxy agent defining a value on 
all possible bundles of goods in which they have interest 
together with the latest time period in which they are 
willing to wait to receive the good s the proxy agents use 
this information to determine how much to bid for options 
and follow a dominant bidding strategy across all relevant 
auctions a proxy agent exercises options held when the 
buyer s patience has expired choosing options that 
maximize a buyer s payoff given the reported valuation all other 
options are returned to the market and not exercised the 
options-based protocol makes truthful and immediate 
revelation to a proxy a dominant strategy for buyers whatever 
the future auction dynamics 
we conduct an empirical analysis of ebay collecting data 
on over four months of bids for dell lcd screens model 
e fp starting in the summer of lcd screens are 
a high-ticket item for which we demonstrate evidence of 
the sequential bidding problem we first infer a 
conservative model for the arrival time departure time and value of 
bidders on ebay for lcd screens during this period this 
model is used to simulate the performance of the 
optionsbased infrastructure in order to make direct comparisons to 
the actual performance of ebay in this market 
we also extend the work of haile and tamer to 
estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of ebay 
bidders taking into account the sequential auction 
problem when making the adjustments using this estimate one 
can approximate how much greater a bidder s true value is 
 
prior work has shown price matching as a potential 
mechanism for colluding firms to set monopoly prices however 
in our context auction prices will be matched which are 
not explicitly set by sellers but rather by buyers bids 
from the maximum bid they were observed to have placed 
on ebay based on this approximation revenue generated 
in a simulation of the options-based scheme exceeds 
revenue on ebay for the comparable population and sequence of 
auctions by while the options-based scheme 
demonstrates itself as being more efficient 
 related work 
a number of authors have analyzed the 
multiple copies problem often times in the context of 
categorizing or modeling sniping behavior for reasons other 
than those first brought forward by ockenfels and roth 
 these papers perform equilibrium analysis in simpler 
settings assuming bidders can participate in at most two 
auctions peters severinov extend these models to 
allow buyers to consider an arbitrary number of auctions and 
characterize a perfect bayesian equilibrium however their 
model does not allow auctions to close at distinct times and 
does not consider the arrival and departure of bidders 
previous work have developed a data-driven approach 
toward developing a taxonomy of strategies employed by 
bidders in practice when facing multi-unit auctions but have 
not considered the sequential bidding problem 
previous work has also sought to provide agents with smarter 
bidding strategies unfortunately it seems hard 
to design artificial agents with equilibrium bidding 
strategies even for a simple simultaneous ascending price auction 
iwasaki et al have considered the role of options in 
the context of a single monolithic auction design to help 
bidders with marginal-increasing values avoid exposure in 
a multi-unit homogeneous item auction problem in other 
contexts options have been discussed for selling coal mine 
leases or as leveled commitment contracts for use in a 
decentralized market place most similar to our work 
gopal et al use options for reducing the risks of buyers 
and sellers in the sequential auction problem however their 
work uses costly options and does not remove the sequential 
bidding problem completely 
work on online mechanisms and online auctions 
 considers agents that can dynamically arrive and depart 
across time we leverage a recent price-based 
characterization by hajiaghayi et al to provide a dominant strategy 
equilibrium for buyers within our options-based protocol 
the special case for single-unit buyers is equivalent to the 
protocol of hajiaghayi et al albeit with an options-based 
interpretation 
jiang and leyton-brown use machine learning 
techniques for bid identification in online auctions 
 ebay and the dell e fp 
the most common type of auction held on ebay is a 
singleitem proxy auction auctions open at a given time and 
remain open for a set period of time usually one week 
bidders bid for the item by giving a proxy a value ceiling the 
proxy will bid on behalf of the bidder only as much as is 
necessary to maintain a winning position in the auction up to 
the ceiling received from the bidder bidders may 
communicate with the proxy multiple times before an auction closes 
in the event that a bidder s proxy has been outbid a bidder 
may give the proxy a higher ceiling to use in the auction 
ebay s proxy auction implements an incremental version of 
a vickrey auction with the item sold to the highest bidder 
for the second-highest bid plus a small increment

the market analyzed in this paper is that of a specific 
model of an lcd monitor a dell lcd model e fp 
this market was selected for a variety of reasons including 
 the mean price of the monitor was with 
standard deviation so we believe it reasonable to 
assume that bidders on the whole are only interested in 
acquiring one copy of the item on ebay 
 the volume transacted is fairly high at approximately 
 units sold per month 
 the item is not usually bundled with other items 
 the item is typically sold as new and so suitable for 
the price-matching of the options-based scheme 
raw auction information was acquired via a perl script 
the script accesses the ebay search engine 
and returns all 
auctions containing the terms  dell and  lcd that have 
closed within the past month 
data was stored in a text 
file for post-processing to isolate the auctions in the 
domain of interest queries were made against the titles of ebay 
auctions that closed between may through 
october 
figure provides a general sense of how many lcd 
auctions occur while a bidder is interested in pursuing a 
monitor 
 bidders had more than one auction 
available between when they first placed a bid on ebay and the 
 
for reference dell s october mail order catalogue 
quotes the price of the monitor as being without a 
desktop purchase and as part of a desktop purchase 
upgrade 
 
http search ebay com 
 
the search is not case-sensitive 
 
specifically the query found all auctions where the title 
contained all of the following strings  dell  lcd and 
 e fp while excluding all auctions that contained any 
of the following strings  dimension  ghz  desktop  p 
and  gb the exclusion terms were incorporated so that the 
only auctions analyzed would be those selling exclusively the 
lcd of interest for example the few bundled auctions 
selling both a dell dimension desktop and the e fp lcd 
are excluded 
 
as a reference most auctions close on ebay between noon 
and midnight edt with almost two auctions for the dell 
lcd monitor closing each hour on average during peak time 
periods bidders have an average observed patience of 
days with a standard deviation of days 
latest closing time of an auction in which they bid with an 
average of auctions available figure also illustrates 
the number of auctions in which each bidder participates 
only of bidders who had more than one auction 
available are observed to bid in more than one auction bidding 
in auctions on average a simple regression analysis 
shows that bidders tend to submit maximal bids to an 
auction that are higher after spending twice as much time 
in the system as well as bids that are higher in each 
subsequent auction 
among the bidders that won exactly one monitor and 
participated in multiple auctions paid more than 
 more than the closing price of another auction in which 
they bid paying on average more standard deviation 
 than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which 
they bid but did not win furthermore among the 
bidders that never won an item despite participating in 
multiple auctions placed a losing bid in one auction 
that was more than higher than the closing price of 
another auction in which they bid submitting a losing bid on 
average more standard deviation than the 
closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did 
not win although these measures do not say a bidder that 
lost could have definitively won because we only consider 
the final winning price and not the bid of the winner to her 
proxy or a bidder that won could have secured a better 
price this is at least indicative of some bidder mistakes 
 modeling the sequential 
auction problem 
while the ebay analysis was for simple bidders who 
desire only a single item let us now consider a more general 
scenario where people may desire multiple goods of different 
types possessing general valuations over those goods 
consider a world with buyers sometimes called bidders 
b and k different types of goods g gk let t 
denote time periods let l denote a bundle of goods 
represented as a vector of size k where lk ∈ denotes 
the quantity of good type gk in the bundle 
the type of a 
buyer i ∈ b is ai di vi with arrival time ai ∈ t departure 
time di ∈ t and private valuation vi l ≥ for each bundle 
of goods l received between ai and di and zero value 
otherwise the arrival time models the period in which a buyer 
first realizes her demand and enters the market while the 
departure time models the period in which a buyer loses 
interest in acquiring the good s in settings with general 
valuations we need an additional assumption an upper bound 
on the difference between a buyer s arrival and departure 
denoted δmax buyers have quasi-linear utilities so that 
the utility of buyer i receiving bundle l and paying p in 
some period no later than di is ui l p vi l − p each 
seller j ∈ s brings a single item kj to the market has no 
intrinsic value and wants to maximize revenue seller j has 
an arrival time aj which models the period in which she 
is first interested in listing the item while the departure 
time dj models the latest period in which she is willing to 
consider having an auction for the item close a seller will 
receive payment by the end of the reported departure of the 
winning buyer 
 
we extend notation whereby a single item k of type gk 
refers to a vector l lk 
 
we say an individual auction in a sequence is locally 
strategyproof lsp if truthful bidding is a dominant strategy 
for a buyer that can only bid in that auction consider the 
following example to see that lsp is insufficient for the 
existence of a dominant bidding strategy for buyers facing a 
sequence of auctions 
example alice values one ton of sand with one ton 
of stone at bob holds a vickrey auction for one ton 
of sand on monday and a vickrey auction for one ton of 
stone on tuesday alice has no dominant bidding strategy 
because she needs to know the price for stone on tuesday to 
know her maximum willingness to pay for sand on monday 
definition the sequential auction problem given 
a sequence of auctions despite each auction being locally 
strategyproof a bidder has no dominant bidding strategy 
consider a sequence of auctions generally auctions 
selling the same item will be uncertainly-ordered because a 
buyer will not know the ordering of closing prices among 
the auctions define the interesting bundles for a buyer as 
all bundles that could maximize the buyer s profit for some 
combination of auctions and bids of other buyers 
within 
the interesting bundles say that an item has uncertain 
marginal value if the marginal value of an item depends on the 
other goods held by the buyer 
say that an item is 
oversupplied if there is more than one auction offering an item 
of that type say two bundles are substitutes if one of those 
bundles has the same value as the union of both bundles 
proposition given locally strategyproof single-item 
auctions the sequential auction problem exists for a bidder if 
and only if either of the following two conditions is true 
within the set of interesting bundles a there are two 
bundles that are substitutes b there is an item with uncertain 
marginal value or c there is an item that is over-supplied 
 a bidder faces competitors bids that are conditioned on 
the bidder s past bids 
proof sketch ⇐ a bidder does not have a dominant 
strategy when a she does not know which bundle among 
substitutes to pursue b she faces the exposure problem 
or c she faces the multiple copies problem additionally 
a bidder does not have a dominant strategy when she does 
not how to optimally influence the bids of competitors ⇒ 
by contradiction a bidder has a dominant strategy to bid 
its constant marginal value for a given item in each auction 
available when conditions and are both false 
for example the following buyers all face the sequential 
auction problem as a result of condition a b and c 
respectively a buyer who values one ton of sand for 
or one ton of stone for but not both sand and stone 
a buyer who values one ton of sand for one ton of 
stone for and one ton of sand and one ton of stone for 
 and can participate in an auction for sand before an 
auction for stone a buyer who values one ton of sand for 
 and can participate in many auctions selling sand 
 
assume that the empty set is an interesting bundle 
 
formally an item k has uncertain marginal value if m 
m vi q − vi q − k ∀q ⊆ l ∈ interestingbundle q ⊇ 
k 
 
formally two bundles a and b are substitutes if vi a ∪ 
b max vi a vi b where a ∪ b l where lk 
max ak bk 
 super proxies and options 
the novel solution proposed in this work to resolve the 
sequential auction problem consists of two primary 
components richer proxy agents and options with price matching 
in finance a real option is a right to acquire a real good at 
a certain price called the exercise price for instance alice 
may obtain from bob the right to buy sand from him at 
an exercise price of an option provides the right to 
purchase a good at an exercise price but not the obligation 
this flexibility allows buyers to put together a collection of 
options on goods and then decide which to exercise 
options are typically sold at a price called the option 
price however options obtained at a non-zero option price 
cannot generally support a simple dominant bidding 
strategy as a buyer must compute the expected value of an 
option to justify the cost this computation requires a 
model of the future which in our setting requires a model 
of the bidding strategies and the values of other bidders 
this is the very kind of game-theoretic reasoning that we 
want to avoid 
instead we consider costless options with an option price 
of zero this will require some care as buyers are weakly 
better off with a costless option than without one whatever 
its exercise price however multiple bidders pursuing 
options with no intention of exercising them would cause the 
efficiency of an auction for options to unravel this is the 
role of the mandatory proxy agents which intermediate 
between buyers and the market a proxy agent forces a link 
between the valuation function used to acquire options and 
the valuation used to exercise options if a buyer tells her 
proxy an inflated value for an item she runs the risk of 
having the proxy exercise options at a price greater than her 
value 
 buyer proxies 
 acquiring options 
after her arrival a buyer submits her valuation ˆvi 
 perhaps untruthfully to her proxy in some period ˆai ≥ ai 
along with a claim about her departure time ˆdi ≥ ˆai all 
transactions are intermediated via proxy agents each 
auction is modified to sell an option on that good to the 
highest bidding proxy with an initial exercise price set to the 
second-highest bid received 
when an option in which a buyer is interested becomes 
available for the first time the proxy determines its bid 
by computing the buyer s maximum marginal value for the 
item and then submits a bid in this amount a proxy does 
not bid for an item when it already holds an option the 
bid price is 
bidt 
i k max 
l 
 ˆvi l k − ˆvi l 
by having a proxy compute a buyer s maximum marginal 
value for an item and then bidding only that amount a 
buyer s proxy will win any auction that could possibly be of 
benefit to the buyer and only lose those auctions that could 
never be of value to the buyer 
 
the system can set a reserve price for each good provided 
that the reserve is universal for all auctions selling the same 
item without a universal reserve price price matching is 
not possible because of the additional restrictions on prices 
that individual sellers will accept 
 
buyer type monday tuesday 
molly mon tues nancy nancy → polly 
nancy mon tues - polly 
polly mon tues 
-table three-buyer example with each wanting a 
single item and one auction occurring on monday and 
tuesday xy implies an option with exercise price x and 
bookkeeping that a proxy has prevented y from 
currently possessing an option → is the updating of 
exercise price and bookkeeping 
when a proxy wins an auction for an option the proxy 
will store in its local memory the identity which may be 
a pseudonym of the proxy not holding an option because 
of the proxy s win i e the proxy that it  bumped from 
winning if any this information will be used for price 
matching 
 pricing options 
sellers agree by joining the market to allow the proxy 
representing a buyer to adjust the exercise price of an option 
that it holds downwards if the proxy discovers that it could 
have achieved a better price by waiting to bid in a later 
auction for an option on the same good to assist in the 
implementation of the price matching scheme each proxy 
tracks future auctions for an option that it has already won 
and will determine who would be bidding in that auction 
had the proxy delayed its entry into the market until this 
later auction the proxy will request price matching from 
the seller that granted it an option if the proxy discovers that 
it could have secured a lower price by waiting to reiterate 
the proxy does not acquire more than one option for any 
good rather it reduces the exercise price on its already 
issued option if a better deal is found 
the proxy is able to discover these deals by asking each 
future auction to report the identities of the bidders in that 
auction together with their bids this needs to be enforced 
by ebay as the central authority the highest bidder in this 
later auction across those whose identity is not stored in 
the proxy s memory for the given item is exactly the bidder 
against whom the proxy would be competing had it delayed 
its entry until this auction if this high bid is lower than the 
current option price held the proxy price matches down 
to this high bid price 
after price matching one of two adjustments will be made 
by the proxy for bookkeeping purposes if the winner of 
the auction is the bidder whose identity has been in the 
proxy s local memory the proxy will replace that local 
information with the identity of the bidder whose bid it just 
price matched as that is now the bidder the proxy has 
prevented from obtaining an option if the auction winner s 
identity is not stored in the proxy s local memory the 
memory may be cleared in this case the proxy will simply price 
match against the bids of future auction winners on this 
item until the proxy departs 
example table molly s proxy wins the 
monday auction submitting a bid of and receiving an option 
for molly s proxy adds nancy to its local memory as 
nancy s proxy would have won had molly s proxy not bid 
on tuesday only nancy s and polly s proxy bid as molly s 
proxy holds an option with nancy s proxy winning an 
opbuyer type monday tuesday

tion for and noting that it bumped polly s proxy at this 
time molly s proxy will price match its option down to 
and replace nancy with polly in its local memory as per the 
price match algorithm as polly would be holding an option 
had molly never bid 
 exercising options 
at the reported departure time the proxy chooses which 
options to exercise therefore a seller of an option must 
wait until period ˆdw for the option to be exercised and 
receive payment where w was the winner of the option

bidder i in period ˆdi the proxy chooses the option s that 
maximize the reported utility of the buyer

where θ is the set of all options held γ θ are the goods 
corresponding to a set of options and π θ is the sum of 
exercise prices for a set of options all other options are 
returned 
no options are exercised when no combination 
of options have positive utility 
 why bookkeep and not match winning price 
one may believe that an alternative method for 
implementing a price matching scheme could be to simply have 
proxies match the lowest winning price they observe after 
winning an option however as demonstrated in table 
such a simple price matching scheme will not lead to a 
truthful system 
the first scenario in table demonstrates the outcome 
if all agents were to truthfully report their types molly 
 
while this appears restrictive on the seller we believe it not 
significantly different than what sellers on ebay currently 
endure in practice an auction on ebay closes at a specific 
time but a seller must wait until a buyer relinquishes 
payment before being able to realize the revenue an amount of 
time that could easily be days if payment is via a money 
order sent through courier to much longer if a buyer is 
slow but not overtly delinquent in remitting her payment 
 
presumably an option returned will result in the seller 
holding a new auction for an option on the item it still 
possesses however the system will not allow a seller to 
re-auction an option until δmax after the option had first 
been issued in order to maintain a truthful mechanism 
 
would win the monday auction and receive an option with 
an exercise price of subsequently exercising that option 
at the end of monday and nancy would win the tuesday 
auction and receive an option with an exercise price of 
 subsequently exercising that option at the end of tuesday 
the second scenario in table demonstrates the outcome 
if nancy were to misreport her value for the good by 
reporting an inflated value of using the proposed bookkeeping 
method nancy would win the monday auction and receive 
an option with an exercise price of on tuesday polly 
would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise 
price of nancy s proxy would observe that the highest 
bid submitted on tuesday among those proxies not stored 
in local memory is polly s bid of and so nancy s proxy 
would price match the exercise price of its option down to 
 note that the exercise price nancy s proxy has obtained 
at the end of tuesday is the same as when she truthfully 
revealed her type to her proxy 
the third scenario in table demonstrates the outcome if 
nancy were to misreport her value for the good by reporting 
an inflated value of if the price matching scheme were 
for proxies to simply match their option price to the 
lowest winning price at any time while they are in the system 
nancy would win the monday auction and receive an option 
with an exercise price of on tuesday polly would win 
the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of 
 nancy s proxy would observe that the lowest price on 
tuesday was and so nancy s proxy would price match 
the exercise price of its option down to note that the 
exercise price nancy s proxy has obtained at the end of 
tuesday is lower than when she truthfully revealed her type to 
the proxy 
therefore a price matching policy of simply matching the 
lowest price paid may not elicit truthful information from 
buyers

 truthful bidding to the proxy agent 
proxies transform the market into a direct revelation 
mechanism where each buyer i interacts with the proxy only 
once 
and does so by declaring a bid bi which is 
defined as an announcement of her type ˆai ˆdi ˆvi where 
the announcement may or may not be truthful we 
denote all received bids other than i s as b−i given bids

a dominant strategy equilibrium for buyers requires that 
vi xi bi b−i −pi bi b−i ≥ vi xi bi b−i −pi bi b−i ∀bi 
bi ∀b−i 
we now establish that it is a dominant strategy for a buyer 
to reveal her true valuation and true departure time to her 
proxy agent immediately upon arrival to the system the

departure ˆdi because the allocation is made in period ˆdi and 
the agent would have no value for this allocation agent 
i cannot benefit from reporting a later arrival ˆai ≥ ai or 
earlier departure ˆdi ≤ di because of price monotonicity 
finally the agent cannot benefit from reporting some ˆvi vi 
because its reported valuation does not change the prices 
it faces and the mechanism maximizes its utility given its 
reported valuation and given the prices 
lemma at any given time there is at most one buyer 
in the system whose proxy does not hold an option for a 
given item type because of buyer i s presence in the system 
and the identity of that buyer will be stored in i s proxy s 
local memory at that time if such a buyer exists 
proof by induction consider the first proxy that a 
buyer prevents from winning an option either a the 
 
for analysis purposes we view the mechanism as an opaque 
market so that the buyer cannot condition her bid on bids 
placed by others 
 
bumped proxy will leave the system having never won an 
option or b the bumped proxy will win an auction in the 
future if a the buyer s presence prevented exactly that 
one buyer from winning an option but will have not 
prevented any other proxies from winning an option as the 
buyer s proxy will not bid on additional options upon 
securing one and will have had that bumped proxy s identity 
in its local memory by definition of the algorithm if b 
the buyer has not prevented the bumped proxy from 
winning an option after all but rather has prevented only the 
proxy that lost to the bumped proxy from winning if any 
whose identity will now be stored in the proxy s local 
memory by definition of the algorithm for this new identity in 
the buyer s proxy s local memory either scenario a or b 
will be true ad infinitum 
given this we show that the options-based 
infrastructure implements a price-based auction with a monotonic and 
value-independent price schedule to every agent 
theorem truthful revelation of valuation arrival and 
departure is a dominant strategy for a buyer in the 
optionsbased market 
proof first define a simple agent-independent price 
function pk 
i t v−i as the highest bid by the proxies not 
holding an option on an item of type gk at time t not 
including the proxy representing i herself and not 
including any proxies that would have already won an option had 
i never entered the system i e whose identity is stored 
in i s proxy s local memory ∞ if no supply at t this 
set of proxies is independent of any declaration i makes to 
its proxy as the set explicitly excludes the at most one 
proxy see lemma that i has prevented from holding 
an option and each bid submitted by a proxy within this 
set is only a function of their own buyer s declared 
valuation see equation furthermore i cannot influence 
the supply she faces as any options returned by bidders 
due to a price set by i s proxy s bid will be re-auctioned 
after i has departed the system therefore pk 
i t v−i is 
independent of i s declaration to its proxy next define 
psk 
i ˆai ˆdi v−i minˆai≤τ≤ ˆdi 
 pk 
i τ v−i possibly ∞ as the 
minimum price over pk 
i t v−i which is clearly monotonic 
by construction of price matching this is exactly the price 
obtained by a proxy on any option that it holds at 
departure define psi ˆai ˆdi l v−i 
èk k 
k psk 
i ˆai ˆdi v−i lk 
which is monotonic in ˆai ˆdi and l since psk 
i ˆai ˆdi v−i is 
monotonic in ˆai and ˆdi and weakly greater than zero for 
each k given the set of options held at ˆdi which may be 
a subset of those items with non-infinite prices the proxy 
exercises options to maximize the reported utility left to 
show is that all bundles that could not be obtained with 
options held are priced sufficiently high as to not be 
preferred for each such bundle either there is an item priced 
at ∞ in which case the bundle would not be desired or 
there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy 
does not hold an option that was available in all auctions 
for such an item there must have been a distinct bidder 
with a bid greater than bidt 
i k which subsequently results 
in psk 
i ˆai ˆdi v−i bidt 
i k and so the bundle without k 
would be preferred to the bundle

 evaluating the options proxy 
infrastructure 
a goal of the empirical benchmarking and a reason to 
collect data from ebay is to try and build a realistic model 
of buyers from which to estimate seller revenue and other 
market effects under the options-based scheme 
we simulate a sequence of auctions that match the timing 
of the dell lcd auctions on ebay 
when an auction 
successfully closes on ebay we simulate a vickrey auction for 
an option on the item sold in that period auctions that do 
not successfully close on ebay are not simulated we 
estimate the arrival departure and value of each bidder on ebay 
from their observed behavior 
arrival is estimated as the 
first time that a bidder interacts with the ebay proxy while 
departure is estimated as the latest closing time among ebay 
auctions in which a bidder participates 
we initially adopt a particularly conservative estimate for 
bidder value estimating it as the highest bid a bidder was 
observed to make on ebay table compares the 
distribution of closing prices on ebay and in the simulated options 
scheme while the average revenue in both schemes is 
virtually the same in the options scheme vs 
on ebay the winners in the options scheme tend to value 
the item won more than the winners on ebay in 
the options scheme vs on ebay 
 bid identification 
we extend the work of haile and tamer to sequential 
auctions to get a better view of underlying bidder values 
rather than assume for bidders an equilibrium behavior as 
in standard econometric techniques haile and tamer do not 
attempt to model how bidders true values get mapped into a 
bid in any given auction rather in the context of repeated 
 
when running the simulations the results of the first and 
final ten days of auctions are not recorded to reduce edge 
effects that come from viewing a discrete time window of a 
continuous process 
 
for the bidders that won multiple times on ebay we 
have each one bid a constant marginal value for each 
additional item in each auction until the number of options 
held equals the total number of lcds won on ebay with 
each option available for price matching independently this 
bidding strategy is not a dominant strategy falling outside 
the type space possible for buyers on which the proof of 
truthfulness has been built but is believed to be the most 
appropriate first order action for simulation

figure cdf of maximum bids observed and upper 
bound estimate of the bidding population s distribution 
for maximum willingness to pay the true population 
distribution lies below the estimated upper bound 
single-item auctions with distinct bidder populations haile 
and tamer make only the following two assumptions when 
estimating the distribution of true bidder values 
 bidders do not bid more than they are willing to pay 
 bidders do not allow an opponent to win at a price 
they are willing to beat 
from the first of their two assumptions given the bids placed 
by each bidder in each auction haile and tamer derive a 
method for estimating an upper bound of the bidding 
population s true value distribution i e the bound that lies 
above the true value distribution from the second of their 
two assumptions given the winning price of each auction 
haile and tamer derive a method for estimating a lower 
bound of the bidding population s true value distribution 
it is only the upper-bound of the distribution that we 
utilize in our work 
haile and tamer assume that bidders only participate in 
a single auction and require independence of the bidding 
population from auction to auction neither assumption is 
valid here the former because bidders are known to bid 
in more than one auction and the latter because the set 
of bidders in an auction is in all likelihood not a true i i d 
sampling of the overall bidding population in particular 
those who win auctions are less likely to bid in successive 
auctions while those who lose auctions are more likely to 
remain bidders in future auctions 
in applying their methods we make the following 
adjustments 
 within a given auction each individual bidder s true 
willingness to pay is assumed weakly greater than the 
maximum bid that bidder submits across all auctions 
for that item either past or future 
 when estimating the upper bound of the value 
distribution if a bidder bids in more than one auction 
randomly select one of the auctions in which the 
bidder bid and only utilize that one observation during 
the estimation 
 
in current work we assume that removing duplicate 
bidders is sufficient to make the buying populations 
independent i i d draws from auction to auction if one believes 
that certain portions of the population are drawn to

lcd screens as well as in the simulated options-based 
market using an adjusted haile and tamer estimate of 
bidders true values being higher than their 
maximum observed bid 
figure provides the distribution of maximum bids placed 
by bidders on ebay as well as the estimated upper bound of 
the true value distribution of bidders based on the extended 
haile and tamer method 
as can be seen the smallest 
relative gap between the two curves meaningfully occurs near 
the th percentile where the upper bound is times 
the maximum bid therefore adopted as a less 
conservative model of bidder values is a uniform scaling factor of 
 
we now present results from this less conservative 
analysis table shows the distribution of closing prices in 
auctions on ebay and in the simulated options scheme the 
mean price in the options scheme is now significantly higher 
 greater than the prices on ebay in the options 
scheme vs on ebay while the standard deviation 
of closing prices is lower among the options scheme auctions 
 in the options scheme vs on ebay therefore not 
only is the expected revenue stream higher but the lower 
variance provides sellers a greater likelihood of realizing that 
higher revenue 
the efficiency of the options scheme remains higher than 
on ebay the winners in the options scheme now have an 
average estimated value higher at 
in an effort to better understand this efficiency we 
formulated a mixed integer program mip to determine a 
simple estimate of the allocative efficiency of ebay the 
mip computes the efficient value of the oﬄine problem with 
full hindsight on all bids and all supply 
using a scaling 
of the total value allocated to ebay winners is 
estimated at while the optimal value from the mip 
is this suggests an allocative efficiency of 
while the typical value of a winner on ebay is an 
average value of was possible 
note the options-based 
tain auctions then further adjustments would be required 
in order to utilize these techniques 
 
the estimation of the points in the curve is a 
minimization over many variables many of which can have 
smallnumbers bias consequently haile and tamer suggest using 
a weighted average over all terms yi of 
è 
i yi 
exp yiρ èj exp yj ρ 
to 
approximate the minimum while reducing the small 
number effects we used ρ − and removed observations 
of auctions with bidders or more as they occurred very 
infrequently however some small numbers bias still 
demonstrated itself with the plateau in our upper bound estimate 
around a value of 
 
buyers who won more than one item on ebay are cloned 
so that they appear to be multiple bidders of identical type 
 
as long as one believes that every bidder s true value is a 
constant factor α away from their observed maximum bid 
the efficiency calculation holds for any value of α in 
practice this belief may not be reasonable for example if 
losing bidders tend to have true values close to their observed 
 
scheme comes very close to achieving this level of efficiency 
 at efficient in this estimate even though it operates 
without the benefit of hindsight 
finally although the typical winning bidder surplus 
decreases between ebay and the options-based scheme some 
surplus redistribution would be possible because the total 
market efficiency is improved 
 discussion 
the biggest concern with our scheme is that proxy agents 
who may be interested in many different items may acquire 
many more options than they finally exercise this can lead 
to efficiency loss notice that this is not an issue when 
bidders are only interested in a single item as in our empirical 
study or have linear-additive values on items 
to fix this we would prefer to have proxy agents use more 
caution in acquiring options and use a more adaptive bidding 
strategy than that in equation for instance if a proxy 
is already holding an option with an exercise price of on 
some item for which it has value of and it values some 
substitute item at the proxy could reason that in no 
circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the 
second item 
we formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along 
these lines let θt be the set of all options a proxy for bidder 
i already possesses at time t let θt ⊆ θt be a subset of 
those options the sum of whose exercise prices are π θt 
and the goods corresponding to those options being γ θt 
let π θt ˆvi γ θt − π θt be the reported available 
surplus associated with a set of options let θ 
t be the set 
of options currently held that would maximize the buyer s 
surplus i e θ 
t argmaxθt⊆θt 
π θt 
let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent 
a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise 
an option on the item given the current options held this 
can be computed as follows 
bidt 
i k max 
l 
 min ˆvi l k − π θ 
t ˆvi l k − ˆvi l 
 
where ˆvi l k −π θ 
t considers surplus already held ˆvi l 
k −ˆvi l considers the marginal value of a good and taking 
the max considers the overall use of pursuing the good 
however and somewhat counter intuitively we are not 
able to implement this bidding scheme without forfeiting 
truthfulness the π θ 
t term in equation i e the amount 
of guaranteed surplus bidder i has already obtained can be 
influenced by proxy j s bid therefore bidder j may have 
the incentive to misrepresent her valuation to her proxy if 
she believes doing so will cause i to bid differently in the 
future in a manner beneficial to j consider the following 
example where the proxy scheme is refined to bid the 
maximum willingness to pay 
example alice values either one ton of sand or one 
ton of stone for bob values either one ton of sand 
or one ton of stone for all bidders have a patience 
maximum bids while ebay winners have true values much 
greater than their observed maximum bids then downward 
bias is introduced in the efficiency calculation at present 
 
the increase in ebay winner surplus between tables and 
 is to be expected as the α scaling strictly increases the 
estimated value of the ebay winners while holding the prices 
at which they won constant 
of days on day one a sand auction is held where alice s 
proxy bids and bob s bids alice s proxy wins 
an option to purchase sand for on day two a stone 
auction is held where alice s proxy bids as she has 
already obtained a guaranteed of surplus from winning 
a sand option and so reduces her stone bid by this amount 
and bob s bids either alice s proxy or bob s proxy 
will win the stone option at the end of the second day 
alice s proxy holds an option with an exercise price of 
to obtain a good valued for and so obtains in 
surplus 
now consider what would have happened had alice 
declared that she valued only stone 
example alice declares valuing only stone for 
bob values either one ton of sand or one ton of stone for 
 all bidders have a patience of days on day one a 
sand auction is held where bob s proxy bids bob s 
proxy wins an option to purchase sand for on day two 
a stone auction is held where alice s proxy bids and 
bob s bids as he has already obtained a guaranteed 
of surplus from winning a sand option and so reduces his 
stone bid by this amount alice s proxy wins the stone 
option for at the end of the second day alice s proxy 
holds an option with an exercise price of to obtain a good 
valued for and so obtains in surplus 
by misrepresenting her valuation i e excluding her value 
of sand alice was able to secure higher surplus by guiding 
bob s bid for stone to an area of immediate further 
work by the authors is to develop a more sophisticated proxy 
agent that can allow for bidding of maximum willingness to 
pay equation while maintaining truthfulness 
an additional practical concern with our proxy scheme 
is that we assume an available trusted and well understood 
method to characterize goods and presumably the quality 
of goods we envision this happening in practice by 
sellers defining a classification for their item upon entering the 
market for instance via a upc code just as in ebay this 
would allow an opportunity for sellers to improve revenue by 
overstating the quality of their item new vs like new 
and raises the issue of how well a reputation scheme could 
address this 
 conclusions 
we introduced a new sales channel consisting of an 
optionsbased and proxied auction protocol to address the 
sequential auction problem that exists when bidders face 
multiple auctions for substitutes and complements goods our 
scheme provides bidders with a simple dominant and 
truthful bidding strategy even though the market remains open 
and dynamic 
in addition to exploring more sophisticated proxies that 
bid in terms of maximum willingness to pay future work 
should aim to better model seller incentives and resolve the 
strategic problems facing sellers for instance does the 
options scheme change seller incentives from what they 
currently are on ebay
