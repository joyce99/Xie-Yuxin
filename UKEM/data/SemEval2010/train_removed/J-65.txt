abstract 
dichotomies between privacy attitudes and behavior have 
been noted in the literature but not yet fully explained we 
apply lessons from the research on behavioral economics to 
understand the individual decision making process with 
respect to privacy in electronic commerce we show that it is 
unrealistic to expect individual rationality in this context 
models of self-control problems and immediate gratification 
offer more realistic descriptions of the decision process and 
are more consistent with currently available data in 
particular we show why individuals who may genuinely want to 
protect their privacy might not do so because of 
psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral literature 
we show that these distortions may affect not only  na¨ıve 
individuals but also  sophisticated ones and we prove that 
this may occur also when individuals perceive the risks from 
not protecting their privacy as significant

 privacy and electronic 
commerce 
privacy remains an important issue for electronic 
commerce a pricewaterhousecoopers study in showed 
that nearly two thirds of the consumers surveyed would 
shop more online if they knew retail sites would not do 
anything with their personal information a federal trade 
commission study reported in that sixty-seven 
percent of consumers were very concerned about the privacy 
of the personal information provided on-line more 
recently a february harris interactive survey found that 
the three biggest consumer concerns in the area of on-line 
personal information security were companies trading 
personal data without permission the consequences of insecure 
transactions and theft of personal data according to 
a jupiter research study in billion in on-line 
sales will be lost by - up from billion in 
online retail sales would be approximately twenty-four percent 
higher in if consumers fears about privacy and 
security were addressed effectively although the media 
hype has somewhat diminished risks and costs have 
notas evidenced by the increasing volumes of electronic spam 
and identity theft 
surveys in this field however as well as experiments and 
anecdotal evidence have also painted a different picture 
 have found evidence that even privacy 
concerned individuals are willing to trade-off privacy for 
convenience or bargain the release of very personal information in 
exchange for relatively small rewards the failure of several 
on-line services aimed at providing anonymity for internet 
users offers additional indirect evidence of the reluctance 
by most individuals to spend any effort in protecting their 
personal information 
the dichotomy between privacy attitudes and behavior 
has been highlighted in the literature preliminary 
interpretations of this phenomenon have been provided 
 still missing are an explanation grounded in 
economic or psychological theories an empirical validation of 
the proposed explanation and of course the answer to the 
most recurring question should people bother at all about 
privacy 
in this paper we focus on the first question we formally 
analyze the individual decision making process with respect 
to privacy and its possible shortcomings we focus on 
individual mis conceptions about their handling of risks they 
face when revealing private information we do not address 
the issue of whether people should actually protect 
themselves we will comment on that in section where we will 
also discuss strategies to empirically validate our theory 
we apply lessons from behavioral economics traditional 
economics postulates that people are forward-looking and 
bayesian updaters they take into account how current 
behavior will influence their future well-being and preferences 
for example study rational models of addiction this 
approach can be compared to those who see in the decision 
 
not to protect one s privacy a rational choice given the 
 supposedly low risks at stake however developments in the 
area of behavioral economics have highlighted various forms 
of psychological inconsistencies self-control problems 
hyperbolic discounting present-biases etc that clash with 
the fully rational view of the economic agent in this 
paper we draw from these developments to reach the following 
conclusions 
 we show that it is unlikely that individuals can act 
rationally in the economic sense when facing privacy 
sensitive decisions 
 we show that alternative models of personal behavior 
and time-inconsistent preferences are compatible with 
the dichotomy between attitudes and behavior and can 
better match current data for example they can 
explain the results presented by at the acm ec 
 conference in their experiment self-proclaimed 
privacy advocates were found to be willing to reveal 
varying amounts of personal information in exchange 
for small rewards 
 in particular we show that individuals may have a 
tendency to under-protect themselves against the privacy 
risks they perceive and over-provide personal 
information even when wary of perceived risks involved 
 we show that the magnitude of the perceived costs of 
privacy under certain conditions will not act as 
deterrent against behavior the individual admits is risky 
 we show following similar studies in the economics of 
immediate gratification that even  sophisticated 
individuals may under certain conditions become 
 privacy myopic 
our conclusion is that simply providing more 
information and awareness in a self-regulative environment is not 
sufficient to protect individual privacy improved 
technologies by lowering costs of adoption and protection certainly 
can help however more fundamental human behavioral 
responses must also be addressed if privacy ought to be 
protected 
in the next section we propose a model of rational agents 
facing privacy sensitive decisions in section we show the 
difficulties that hinder any model of privacy decision 
making based on full rationality in section we show how 
behavioral models based on immediate gratification bias can 
better explain the attitudes-behavior dichotomy and match 
available data in section we summarize and discuss our 
conclusions 
 a model of rationality in 
privacy decision making 
some have used the dichotomy between privacy attitudes 
and behavior to claim that individuals are acting rationally 
when it comes to privacy under this view individuals may 
accept small rewards for giving away information because 
they expect future damages to be even smaller when 
discounted over time and with their probability of occurrence 
here we want to investigate what underlying assumptions 
about personal behavior would support the hypothesis of 
full rationality in privacy decision making 
since economists have been interested in 
privacy but only recently formal models have started 
appearing while these studies focus on market 
interactions between one agent and other parties here we are 
interested in formalizing the decision process of the single 
individual we want to see if individuals can be 
economically rational forward-lookers bayesian updaters utility 
maximizers and so on when it comes to protect their own 
personal information 
the concept of privacy once intended as the right to be 
left alone has transformed as our society has become 
more information oriented in an information society the self 
is expressed defined and affected through and by 
information and information technology the boundaries between 
private and public become blurred privacy has therefore 
become more a class of multifaceted interests than a single 
unambiguous concept hence its value may be discussed if 
not ascertained only once its context has also been 
specified this most often requires the study of a network of 
relations between a subject certain information related to 
the subject other parties that may have various linkages 
of interest or association with that information or that 
subject and the context in which such linkages take place 
to understand how a rational agent could navigate through 
those complex relations in equation we abstract the 
decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who 
is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain 
transaction 
max 
d 
ut δ ve a pd 
 a γ ve t pd 
 t − cd 
t 
in equation δ and γ are unspecified functional forms 
that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs 
from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of 
occurrence of those events p more precisely the utility u of 
completing a transaction t the transaction being any action 
- not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving 
exposure of personal information is equal to some function 
of the expected payoff ve a from maintaining or not 
certain information private during that transaction and the 
probability of maintaining or not maintaining that 
information private when using technology d pd 
 a − pd

plus some function of the expected payoff ve t from 
completing or non completing the transaction possibly 
revealing personal information and the probability of completing 
 or not completing that transaction with a certain 
technology d pd 
 t − pd 
 t minus the cost of using the 
technology t cd 
t 
the technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing 
since the payoffs in equation can be either positive or 
negative equation embodies the duality implicit in privacy 
issues there are both costs and benefits gained from 
revealing or from protecting personal information and the costs 
and benefits from completing a transaction ve t might be 
distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the 
associated information private ve a for instance revealing 
one s identity to an on-line bookstore may earn a discount 
viceversa it may also cost a larger bill because of price 
discrimination protecting one s financial privacy by not 
divulging credit card information on-line may protect against 
future losses and hassles related to identity theft but it may 
 
see also 
 
make one s on-line shopping experience more cumbersome 
and therefore more expensive 
the functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable 
weights and attitudes an individual may have towards 
keeping her information private for example her privacy 
sensitivity or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect 
should be enforced by the government and completing 
certain transactions note that ve and p could refer to sets of 
payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence the 
payoffs are themselves only expected because regardless of 
the probability that the transaction is completed or the 
information remains private they may depend on other sets of 
events and their associated probabilities ve and pd 
 in 
other words can be read as multi-variate parameters inside 
which are hidden several other variables expectations and 
functions because of the complexity of the privacy network 
described above 
over time the probability of keeping certain information 
private for instance will not only depend on the chosen 
technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to 
appropriate that information these efforts may be function 
among other things of the expected value of that 
information to those parties the probability of keeping 
information private will also depend on the environment in which 
the transaction is taking place similarly the expected 
benefit from keeping information private will also be a 
collection over time of probability distributions dependent on 
several parameters imagine that the probability of keeping 
your financial transactions private is very high when you 
use a bank in bermuda still the expected value from 
keeping your financial information confidential will depend on a 
number of other factors 
a rational agent would in theory choose the technology 
d that maximizes her expected payoff in equation maybe 
she would choose to complete the transaction under the 
protection of a privacy enhancing technology maybe she would 
complete the transaction without protection maybe she 
would not complete the transaction at all d for 
example the agent may consider the costs and benefits of 
sending an email through an anonymous mix-net system 
 and compare those to the costs and benefits of sending 
that email through a conventional non-anonymous 
channel the magnitudes of the parameters in equation will 
change with the chosen technology mix-net systems may 
decrease the expected losses from privacy intrusions 
nonanonymous email systems may promise comparably higher 
reliability and possibly reduced costs of operations 
 rationality and psychological 
distortions in privacy 
equation is a comprehensive while intentionally generic 
road-map for navigation across privacy trade-offs that no 
human agent would be actually able to use 
we hinted to some difficulties as we noted that several 
layers of complexities are hidden inside concepts such as the 
expected value of maintaining certain information private 
and the probability of succeeding doing so more precisely 
an agent will face three problems when comparing the 
tradeoffs implicit in equation incomplete information about all 
parameters bounded power to process all available 
information no deviation from the rational path towards 
utilitymaximization those three problems are precisely the same 
issues real people have to deal with on an everyday basis as 
they face privacy-sensitive decisions we discuss each 
problem in detail 
 incomplete information what information has the 
individual access to as she prepares to take privacy sensitive 
decisions for instance is she aware of privacy invasions and 
the associated risks what is her knowledge of the existence 
and characteristics of protective technologies 
economic transactions are often characterized by 
incomplete or asymmetric information different parties involved 
may not have the same amount of information about the 
transaction and may be uncertain about some important 
aspects of it incomplete information will affect almost all 
parameters in equation and in particular the estimation 
of costs and benefits costs and benefits associated with 
privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both 
monetary and immaterial monetary costs may for instance 
include adoption costs which are probably fixed and usage 
costs which are variable of protective technologies - if the 
individual decides to protect herself or they may include 
the financial costs associated to identity theft if the 
individual s information turns out not to have been adequately 
protected immaterial costs may include learning costs of 
a protective technology switching costs between different 
applications or social stigma when using anonymizing 
technologies and many others likewise the benefits from 
protecting or not protecting personal information may also be 
easy to quantify in monetary terms the discount you receive 
for revealing personal data or be intangible the feeling of 
protection when you send encrypted emails 
it is difficult for an individual to estimate all these 
values through information technology privacy invasions can 
be ubiquitous and invisible many of the payoffs associated 
with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or 
ascertained only ex post through actual experience consider 
for instance the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting 
technologies described in 
in addition the calculations implicit in equation depend 
on incomplete information about the probability 
distribution of future events some of those distributions may be 
predicted after comparable data - for example the 
probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud 
today could be calculated using existing statistics the 
probability distributions of other events may be very 
difficult to estimate because the environment is too 
dynamicfor example the probability of being subject to identity theft 
 years in the future because of certain data you are 
releasing now and the distributions of some other events may be 
almost completely subjective - for example the probability 
that a new and practical form of attack on a currently 
secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal 
communications a few years from now 
this leads to a related problem bounded rationality 
 bounded rationality is the individual able to 
calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice or is she 
limited by bounded rationality 
in our context bounded rationality refers to the inability 
to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs 
associated with various strategies the individual may choose in 
privacy-sensitive situations it also refers to the inability to 
process all the stochastic information related to risks and 
probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits 
 
in traditional economic theory the agent is assumed to 
have both rationality and unbounded  computational power 
to process information but human agents are unable to 
process all information in their hands and draw accurate 
conclusions from it in the scenario we consider once 
an individual provides personal information to other parties 
she literally loses control of that information that loss of 
control propagates through other parties and persists for 
unpredictable spans of time being in a position of 
information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she 
is transacting decisions must be based on stochastic 
assessments and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect 
the individual become very difficult to aggregate calculate 
and compare 
bounded rationality will affect the 
calculation of the parameters in equation and in particular δ 
γ ve and pt the cognitive costs involved in trying to 
calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that 
the individual may just resort to simple heuristics 
 psychological distortions eventually even if an 
individual had access to complete information and could 
appropriately compute it she still may find it difficult to 
follow the rational strategy presented in equation a vast 
body of economic and psychological literature has by now 
confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological 
distortions on individual decision making privacy seems to 
be a case study encompassing many of those distortions 
hyperbolic discounting under insurance self-control 
problems immediate gratification and others the traditional 
dichotomy between attitude and behavior observed in 
several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social 
psychology literature since and may also appear in 
the privacy space because of these distortions 
for example individuals have a tendency to discount 
 hyperbolically future costs or benefits in economics 
hyperbolic discounting implies inconsistency of personal 
preferences over time - future events may be discounted at 
different discount rates than near-term events hyperbolic 
discounting may affect privacy decisions for instance when we 
heavily discount the low probability of high future risks 
such as identity theft 
related to hyperbolic discounting 
is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks 
 
in general individuals may put constraints on future 
behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility 
people may genuinely want to protect themselves but 
because of self-control bias they will not actually take those 
steps and opt for immediate gratification instead 
people tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their 
states and hence falsely project their current preferences 
over consumption onto their future preferences far more 
than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes 
this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these 
mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in 
dynamicchoice environments p 
 
the negative utility coming from future potential 
misuses of somebody s personal information could be a random 
shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable 
for example a small and apparently innocuous piece of 
information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous 
liability in the right context 
 
a more rigorous description and application of hyperbolic 
discounting is provided in section 
in addition individuals suffer from optimism bias 
the misperception that one s risks are lower than those of 
other individuals under similar conditions optimism bias 
may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy 
intrusions 
individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with 
cumulative risks for instance shows that while young 
smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking they do not 
fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of 
each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a 
serious danger difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks 
apply to privacy because our personal information once 
released can remain available over long periods of time and 
since it can be correlated to other data the  anonymity sets 
 in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller as 
a result the whole risk associated with revealing different 
pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the 
individual risks associated with each piece of data 
also it is easier to deal with actions and effects that 
are closer to us in time actions and effects that are in 
the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited 
foresight perspective as the foresight changes so does 
behavior even when preferences remain the same this 
phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions since the 
costs of privacy protection may be immediate but the 
rewards may be invisible absence of intrusions and spread 
over future periods of time 
to summarize whenever we face privacy sensitive 
decisions we hardly have all data necessary for an informed 
choice but even if we had we would be likely unable to 
process it and even if we could process it we may still end 
behaving against our own better judgment in what follows 
we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based 
on some of these findings and in particular on the plight of 
immediate gratification 
 privacy and the economics of 
immediate gratification 
the problem of immediate gratification which is related 
to the concepts of time inconsistency hyperbolic 
discounting and self-control bias is so described by o donoghue and 
rabin p a person s relative preference for 
wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the 
earlier date gets closer p eople have self-control 
problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification 
in a way that their  long-run selves do not appreciate for 
example if you were given only two alternatives on monday 
you may claim you will prefer working hours on saturday 
to hours and half on sunday but as saturday comes you 
will be more likely to prefer postponing work until sunday 
this simple observation has rather important consequences 
in economic theory where time-consistency of preferences is 
the dominant model consider first the traditional model 
of utility that agents derive from consumption the model 
states that utility discounts exponentially over time 
ut 
t 
τ t 
δτ 
uτ 
in equation the cumulative utility u at time t is the 
discounted sum of all utilities from time t the present until 
time t the future δ is the discount factor with a value 
 
period period period period 
benefits from selling period 
costs from selling period 
benefits from selling period 
costs from selling period 
benefits from selling period 
costs from selling period 
table fictional expected payoffs from joining loyalty program 
between and a value of would imply that the 
individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods 
is worth zero today a value of would imply that the 
individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities 
the discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact 
that having say one dollar one year from now is valuable 
but not as much as having that dollar now in equation 
if all uτ were constant - for instance - and δ was 
then at time t that is now u would be worth but 
u would be worth 
modifying the traditional model of utility discounting 
and then have proposed a model which takes into 
account possible time-inconsistency of preferences consider 
equation 
ut ut ut ut δt 
ut β 
t 
τ t 
δτ 
uτ 
assume that δ β ∈ δ is the discount factor for 
intertemporal utility as in equation β is the parameter 
that captures an individual s tendency to gratify herself 
immediately a form of time-inconsistent preferences when 
β is the model maps the traditional time-consistent 
utility model and equation is identical to equation but 
when β is zero the individual does not care for anything but 
today in fact any β smaller than represents self-control 
bias 
the experimental literature has convincingly proved that 
human beings tend to have self-control problems even when 
they claim otherwise we tend to avoid and postpone 
undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort 
tomorrow and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities 
even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in 
the future 
this analytical framework can be applied to the study 
of privacy attitudes and behavior protecting your privacy 
sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present 
hassle telemarketers or people peeping through your 
window and seeing how you live - see but sometimes it 
represents something akin to getting an insurance against 
future and only uncertain risks in surveys completed at 
time t subjects asked about their attitude towards 
privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting 
themselves at a later time t s and compare those to the 
avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant 
future t s n their alternatives at survey time are 
represented in equation 
min 
wrt x 
du β e cs p δs 
x e cs n i δs n 
 − x 
x is a dummy variable that can take values or it 
represents the individual s choice - which costs the 
individual opts to face the expected cost of protecting herself at 
time s e cs p in which case x or the expected costs 
of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s n 
e cs n i 
the individual is trying to minimize the disutility du of 
these costs with respect to x because she discounts the 
two future events with the same discount factor although 
at different times for certain values of the parameters the 
individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is 
worthy in particular this will happen when 
e cs p δs 
 e cs n i δs n 
 
now consider what happens as the moment t s comes 
now a real price should be paid in order to enjoy some form 
of protection say starting to encrypt all of your emails to 
protect yourself from future intrusions now the individual 
will perceive a different picture 
min 
wrt x 
dus δe cs p x βe cn i δn 
 − x 
note that nothing has changed in the equation certainly 
not the individual s perceived risks except time if β the 
parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems is 
less than one chances are that the individual now will 
actually choose not to protect herself this will in fact happen 
when 
δe cs p βe cn i δn 
 
note that disequalities and may be simultaneously 
met for certain β at survey time the individual 
honestly claimed she wanted to protect herself in 
principlethat is some time in the future but as she is asked to 
make an effort to protect herself right now she chooses to 
run the risk of privacy intrusion 
similar mathematical arguments can be made for the 
comparison between immediate costs with immediate benefits 
 subscribing to a  no-call list to stop telemarketers from 
harassing you at dinner and immediate costs with only 
future expected rewards insuring yourself against identity 
theft or protecting yourself from frauds by never using your 
credit card on-line particularly when expected future 
rewards or avoided risks are also intangible the immaterial 
consequences of living or not in a dossier society or the 
chilling effects or lack thereof of being under surveillance 
the reader will have noticed that we have focused on 
perceived expected costs e c rather than real costs we 
do not know the real costs and we do not claim that the 
 
individual does but we are able to show that under 
certain conditions even costs perceived as very high as during 
periods of intense privacy debate will be ignored 
we can provide some fictional numerical examples to make 
the analysis more concrete we present some scenarios 
inspired by the calculations in 
imagine an economy with just periods table each 
individual can enroll in a supermarket s loyalty program by 
revealing personal information if she does so the individual 
gets a discount of during the period of enrollment only to 
pay one unit each time thereafter because of price 
discrimination based on the information she revealed we make no 
attempt at calibrating the realism of this obviously abstract 
example the point we are focusing on is how time 
inconsistencies may affect individual behavior given the expected 
costs and benefits of certain actions 
depending on which 
period the individual chooses for  selling her data we have 
the undiscounted payoffs represented in table 
imagine that the individual is contemplating these 
options and discounting them according to equation 
suppose that δ for all types of individuals this means that 
for simplicity we do not consider intertemporal discounting 
but β for time-inconsistent individuals and β for 
everybody else the time-consistent individual will choose 
to join the program at the very last period and rip off a 
benefit of - the individual with immediate 
gratification problems for whom β will instead perceive the 
benefits from joining now or in period as equivalent 
and will join the program now thus actually making herself 
worse off 
 also suggest that in addition to the distinction 
between time-consistent individuals and individuals with 
timeinconsistent preferences we should also distinguish 
timeinconsistent individuals who are na¨ıve from those who are 
sophisticated na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals are not 
aware of their self-control problems - for example they are 
those who always plan to start a diet next week 
sophisticated time-inconsistent individuals suffer of immediate 
gratification bias but are at least aware of their inconsistencies 
people in this category choose their behavior today correctly 
estimating their future time-inconsistent behavior 
now consider how this difference affects decisions in 
another scenario represented in table an individual is 
considering the adoption of a certain privacy enhancing 
technology it will cost her some money both to protect herself 
and not to protect herself if she decides to protect herself 
the cost will be the amount she pays - for example - for some 
technology that shields her personal information if she 
decides not to protect herself the cost will be the expected 
consequences of privacy intrusions 
we assume that both these aggregate costs increase over 
time although because of separate dynamics as time goes 
by more and more information about the individual has 
been revealed and it becomes more costly to be protected 
against privacy intrusions at the same time however 
intrusions become more frequent and dangerous 
 
one may claim that loyalty cards keep on providing 
benefits over time here we make the simplifying assumption 
that such benefits are not larger than the future costs 
incurred after having revealed one s tastes we also assume 
that the economy ends in period for all individuals 
regardless of when they chose to join the loyalty program 
in period the individual may protect herself by spending 
 or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the 
following period expected to cost in the second period 
assuming that no intrusion has yet taken place she may 
once again protect herself by spending a little more or 
she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the next 
 third period expected to cost in the third period she 
could protect herself for or face an expected cost of in 
the following last period 
here too we make no attempt at calibrating the values in 
table again we focus on the different behavior driven by 
heterogeneity in time-consistency and sophistication versus 
na¨ıvete we assume that β for individuals with no 
self control problems and β for everybody else we 
assume for simplicity that δ for all 
the time-consistent individuals will obviously choose to 
protect themselves as soon as possible 
in the first period na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals will 
compare the costs of protecting themselves then or face a 
privacy intrusion in the second period because 
 they will prefer to wait until the following period to 
protect themselves but in the second period they will be 
comparing - and so they will postpone their 
protection again they will keep on doing so facing higher 
and higher risks eventually they will risk to incur the 
highest perceived costs of privacy intrusions note again that 
we are simply assuming that individuals believe there are 
privacy risks and that they increase over time we will come 
back to this concept later on 
time-inconsistent but sophisticated individuals on the 
other side will adopt a protective technology in period 
and pay by period in fact they will correctly realize 
that if they wait till period which they are tempted to 
do because their self-control bias will lead 
them to postpone adopting the technology once more 
 because therefore they predict they would 
incur the expected cost which is larger than 
 the cost of protecting oneself in period in period 
however they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect 
themselves further than period so they wait till period 
 because at which time they will adopt a 
protective technology see also 
to summarize time-inconsistent people tend not to fully 
appreciate future risks and if na¨ıve also their inability to 
deal with them this happens even if they are aware of those 
risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing as 
we learnt from the second scenario time inconsistency can 
lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks 
individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present 
low risks but their repetition forms a huge liability it is a 
deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly 
appreciated only after privacy itself is lost this dynamics captures 
the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets 
 where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to 
others so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts 
in addition show that when costs are immediate 
time-inconsistent individuals tend to procrastinate when 
benefits are immediate they tend to preoperate in our 
context things are even more interesting because all privacy 
decisions involve at the same time costs and benefits so 
we opt against using ecash in order to save us the costs 
of switching from credit cards but we accept the risk that 
our credit card number on the internet could be used 
ma 
period period period period 
protection costs 
expected intrusion costs 
table fictional costs of protecting privacy and expected costs of privacy intrusions over time 
liciously and we give away our personal information to 
supermarkets in order to gain immediate discounts - which 
will likely turn into price discrimination in due time 
we have shown in the second scenario above how 
sophisticated but time-inconsistent individuals may choose to 
protect their information only in period sophisticated 
people with self-control problems may be at a loss sometimes 
even when compared to na¨ıve people with time 
inconsistency problems how many privacy advocates do use 
privacy enhancing technologies all the time the reasoning 
is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control 
problems and rather than ignoring them they incorporate 
them into their decision process this may decrease their 
own incentive to behave in the optimal way now 
sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting 
themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic and 
so they may start misbehaving now and may get used to 
that a form of coherent arbitrariness this is consistent 
with the results by presented at the acm ec 
conference found that privacy advocates were also willing 
to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary 
rewards 
it is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are 
not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about 
available technologies individuals in the abstract scenarios 
we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs 
however under certain conditions the magnitude of those 
liabilities is almost irrelevant the individual will take very 
slowly increasing risks which become steps towards huge 
liabilities 
 discussion 
applying models of self-control bias and immediate 
gratification to the study of privacy decision making may offer 
a new perspective on the ongoing privacy debate we have 
shown that a model of rational privacy behavior is 
unrealistic while models based on psychological distortions offer 
a more accurate depiction of the decision process we have 
shown why individuals who genuinely would like to protect 
their privacy may not do so because of psychological 
distortions well documented in the behavioral economics 
literature we have highlighted that these distortions may affect 
not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones 
surprisingly we have also found that these inconsistencies may 
occur when individuals perceive the risks from not 
protecting their privacy as significant 
additional uncertainties risk aversion and varying 
attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements 
in our analysis empirical validation is necessary to calibrate 
the effects of different factors 
an empirical analysis may start with the comparison of 
available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies 
that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy 
concerns for example  do not call marketing lists with 
data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less 
obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but 
also less visible privacy risks for example identity theft 
insurances however only an experimental approach over 
different periods of time in a controlled environment may 
allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors surveys 
alone cannot suffice since we have shown why survey-time 
attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions an 
experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda 
the psychological distortions we have discussed may be 
considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the 
privacy problem industry self-regulation users self protection 
 through technology or other strategies or government s 
intervention the conclusions we have reached suggest that 
individuals may not be trusted to make decisions in their 
best interests when it comes to privacy this does not mean 
that privacy technologies are ineffective on the contrary 
our results by aiming at offering a more realistic model of 
user-behavior could be of help to technologists in their 
design of privacy enhancing tools however our results also 
imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not 
address the heart of the privacy problem improved 
technologies with lower costs of adoption and protection and 
more information about risks and opportunities certainly 
can help however more fundamental human behavioral 
mechanisms must also be addressed self-regulation even 
in presence of complete information and awareness may not 
be trusted to work for the same reasons a combination of 
technology awareness and regulative policies - calibrated 
to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the 
appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare 
increase as in other areas of an economy see on a related 
analysis 
observing that people do not want to pay for privacy or do 
not care about privacy therefore is only a half truth people 
may not be able to act as economically rational agents when 
it comes to personal privacy and the question whether do 
consumers care is a different question from does privacy 
matter whether from an economic standpoint privacy 
ought to be protected or not is still an open question it is 
a question that involves defining specific contexts in which 
the concept of privacy is being invoked but the value of 
privacy eventually goes beyond the realms of economic 
reasoning and cost benefit analysis and ends up relating to one s 
views on society and freedom still even from a purely 
economic perspective anecdotal evidence suggest that the costs 
of privacy from spam to identity theft lost sales intrusions 
and the like are high and increasing
