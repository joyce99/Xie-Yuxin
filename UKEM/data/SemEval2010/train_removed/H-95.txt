abstract 
this paper proposes simple techniques for handling place 
references in search engine queries an important aspect of geographical 
information retrieval we address not only the detection but also 
the disambiguation of place references by matching them 
explicitly with concepts at an ontology moreover when a query does not 
reference any locations we propose to use information from 
documents matching the query exploiting geographic scopes previously 
assigned to these documents evaluation experiments using topics 
from clef campaigns and logs from real search engine queries 
show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches

 introduction 
search engine queries are often associated with geographical 
locations either explicitly i e a location reference is given as part of 
the query or implicitly i e the location reference is not present in 
the query string but the query clearly has a local intent one 
of the concerns of geographical information retrieval gir lies in 
appropriately handling such queries bringing better targeted search 
results and improving user satisfaction 
nowadays gir is getting increasing attention systems that 
access resources on the basis of geographic context are starting to 
appear both in the academic and commercial domains 
accurately and effectively detecting location references in search 
engine queries is a crucial aspect of these systems as they are 
generally based on interpreting geographical terms differently from the 
others detecting locations in queries is also important for 
generalpropose search engines as this information can be used to improve 
ranking algorithms queries with a local intent are best answered 
with localized pages while queries without any geographical 
references are best answered with broad pages 
text mining methods have been successfully used in gir to 
detect and disambiguate geographical references in text or even to 
infer geographic scopes for documents however this body 
of research has been focused on processing web pages and full-text 
documents search engine queries are more difficult to handle in 
the sense that they are very short and with implicit and subjective 
user intents moreover the data is also noisier and more versatile 
in form and we have to deal with misspellings multilingualism 
and acronyms how to automatically understand what the user 
intended given a search query without putting the burden in the user 
himself remains an open text mining problem 
key challenges in handling locations over search engine queries 
include their detection and disambiguation the ranking of possible 
candidates the detection of false positives i e not all contained 
location names refer to geographical locations and the detection of 
implied locations by the context of the query i e when the query 
does not explicitly contain a place reference but it is nonetheless 
geographical simple named entity recognition ner algorithms 
based on dictionary look-ups for geographical names may 
introduce high false positives for queries whose location names do not 
constitute place references for example the query denzel 
washington contains the place name washington but the query is not 
geographical queries can also be geographic without containing 
any explicit reference to locations at the dictionary in these cases 
place name extraction and disambiguation does not give any results 
and we need to access other sources of information 
this paper proposes simple and yet effective techniques for 
handling place references over queries each query is split into a triple 
 what relation where where what specifies the non-geographic 
aspect of the information need where specifies the geographic 
areas of interest and relation specifies a spatial relationship 
connecting what and where when this is not possible i e the query does 
not contain any place references we try using information from 
documents matching the query exploiting geographic scopes 
previously assigned to these documents 
disambiguating place references is one of the most important 
aspects we use a search procedure that combines textual patterns 
with geographical names defined at an ontology and we use 
heuristics to disambiguate the discovered references e g more important 
places are preferred disambiguation results in having the where 
term from the triple above associated with the most likely 
corresponding concepts from the ontology when we cannot detect 
any locations we attempt to use geographical scopes previously 
inferred for the documents at the top search results by doing this 
we assume that the most frequent geographical scope in the results 
should correspond to the geographical context implicit in the query 
experiments with clef topics and sample queries from a 
web search engine show that the proposed methods are accurate 
and may have applications in improving search results 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows we first formalize 
the problem and describe related work to our research next we 
describe our approach for handling place names in queries starting 
with the general approach for disambiguating place references over 
textual strings then presenting the method for splitting a query into 
a what relation where triple and finally discussing the 
technique for exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to 
documents in the result set section presents evaluation results 
finally we give some conclusions and directions for future research 
 concepts and related work 
search engine performance depends on the ability to capture the 
most likely meaning of a query as intended by the user 
previous studies showed that a significant portion of the queries 
submitted to search engines are geographic a recent enhancement 
to search engine technology is the addition of geographic 
reasoning combining geographic information systems and information 
retrieval in order to build search engines that find information 
associated with given locations the ability to recognize and reason 
about the geographical terminology given in the text documents 
and user queries is a crucial aspect of these geographical 
information retrieval gir systems 
extracting and distinguishing different types of entities in text is 
usually referred to as named entity recognition ner for at least 
a decade this has been an important text mining task and a key 
feature of the message understanding conferences muc ner 
has been successfully automated with near-human performance 
but the specific problem of recognizing geographical references 
presents additional challenges when handling named 
entities with a high level of detail ambiguity problems arise more 
frequently ambiguity in geographical references is bi-directional 
the same name can be used for more than one location referent 
ambiguity and the same location can have more than one name 
 reference ambiguity the former has another twist since the same 
name can be used for locations as well as for other class of 
entities such as persons or company names referent class ambiguity 
besides the recognition of geographical expressions gir also 
requires that the recognized expressions be classified and grounded 
to unique identifiers grounding the recognized expressions 
 e g associating them to coordinates or concepts at an ontology 
assures that they can be used in more advanced gir tasks 
previous works have addressed the tagging and grounding of 
locations in web pages as well as the assignment of geographic 
scopes to these documents this is a complementary 
aspect to the techniques described in this paper since if we have the 
web pages tagged with location information a search engine can 
conveniently return pages with a geographical scope related to the 
scope of the query the task of handling geographical references 
over documents is however considerably different from that of 
handling geographical references over queries in our case queries are 
usually short and often do not constitute proper sentences text 
mining techniques that make use of context information are 
difficult to apply for high accuracy 
previous studies have also addressed the use of text mining and 
automated classification techniques over search engine queries 
 however most of these works did not consider place 
references or geographical categories again these previously proposed 
methods are difficult to apply to the geographic domain 
gravano et al studied the classification of web queries into two 
types namely local and global they defined a query as local if 
its best matches on a web search engine are likely to be local pages 
such as houses for sale a number of classification algorithms 
have been evaluated using search engine queries however their 
experimental results showed that only a rather low precision and 
recall could be achieved the problem addressed in this paper is 
also slightly different since we are trying not only to detect local 
queries but also to disambiguate the local of interest 
wang et al proposed to go further than detecting local queries 
by also disambiguating the implicit local of interest the 
proposed approach works for both queries containing place references 
and queries not containing them by looking for dominant 
geographic references over query logs and text from search results 
in comparison we propose simpler techniques based on matching 
names from a geographic ontology our approach looks for spatial 
relationships at the query string and it also associates the place 
references to ontology concepts in the case of queries not containing 
explicit place references we use geographical scopes previously 
assigned to the documents whereas wang et al proposed to 
extract locations from the text of the top search results 
there are nowadays many geocoding reverse-geocoding and 
mapping services on the web that can be easily integrated with 
other applications geocoding is the process of locating points on 
the surface of the earth from alphanumeric addressing data taking 
a string with an address a geocoder queries a geographical 
information system and returns interpolated coordinate values for the 
given location instead of computing coordinates for a given place 
reference the technique described in this paper aims at assigning 
references to the corresponding ontology concepts however if 
each concept at the ontology contains associated coordinate 
information the approach described here could also be used to build a 
geocoding service most of such existing services are commercial 
in nature and there are no technical publications describing them 
a number of commercial search services have also started to 
support location-based searches google local for instance initially 
required the user to specify a location qualifier separately from the 
search query more recently it added location look-up 
capabilities that extract locations from query strings for example in a 
search for pizza seattle google local returns local results for 
pizza near seattle wa however the intrinsics of their solution 
are not published and their approach also does not handle 
locationimplicit queries moreover google local does not take spatial 
relations into account 
in sum there are already some studies on tagging geographical 
references but web queries pose additional challenges which have 
not been addressed in this paper we explain the proposed 
solutions for the identified problems 
 handlingqueriesin gir systems 
most gir queries can be parsed to what relation where 
triple where the what term is used to specify the general 
nongeographical aspect of the information need the where term is used 
to specify the geographical areas of interest and the relation term 
is used to specify a spatial relationship connecting what and where 
while the what term can assume any form in order to reflect any 
information need the relation and where terms should be part of a 
controlled vocabulary in particular the relation term should refer 
to a well-known geographical relation that the underlying gir 
system can interpret e g near or contained at and the where 
term should be disambiguated into a set of unique identifiers 
corresponding to concepts at the ontology 
different systems can use alternative schemes to take input queries 
from the users three general strategies can be identified and gir 
systems often support more than one of the following schemes 
figure strategies for processing queries in geographical information retrieval systems 
 input to the system is a textual query string this is the 
hardest case since we need to separate the query into the three 
different components and then we need to disambiguate the 
where term into a set of unique identifiers 
 input to the system is provided in two separate strings one 
concerning the what term and the other concerning the where 
the relation term can be either fixed e g always assume the 
near relation specified together with the where string 
or provided separately from the users from a set of 
possible choices although there is no need for separating query 
string into the different components we still need to 
disambiguate the where term into a set of unique identifiers 
 input to the system is provided through a query string 
together with an unambiguous description of the geographical 
area of interest e g a sketch in a map spatial coordinates 
or a selection from a set of possible choices no 
disambiguation is required and therefore the techniques described 
in this paper do not have to be applied 
the first two schemes depend on place name disambiguation 
figure illustrates how we propose to handle geographic queries 
in these first two schemes a common component is the algorithm 
for disambiguating place references into corresponding ontology 
concepts which is described next 
 from place names to ontology concepts 
a required task in handling gir queries consists of associating 
a string containing a geographical reference with the set of 
corresponding concepts at the geographic ontology we propose to do 
this according to the pseudo-code listed at algorithm 
the algorithm considers the cases where a second or even more 
than one location is given to qualify a first e g paris france 
it makes recursive calls to match each location and relies on 
hierarchical part-of relations to detect if two locations share a common 
hierarchy path one of the provided locations should be more 
general and the other more specific in the sense that there must exist 
a part-of relationship among the associated concepts at the 
ontology either direct or transitive the most specific location is a 
sub-region of the most general and the algorithm returns the most 
specific one i e for paris france the algorithm returns the 
ontology concept associated with paris the capital city of france 
we also consider the cases where a geographical type expression 
is used to qualify a given name e g city of lisbon or state 
of new york for instance the name lisbon can correspond 
to many different concepts at a geographical ontology and type 
algorithm matching a place name with ontology concepts 
require o a geographic ontology 
require gn a string with the geographic name to be matched 
 l an empty list 
 index the position in gn for the first occurrence of a comma 
semi-colon or bracket character 
 if index is defined then 
 gn the substring of gn from position to index 
 gn the substring of gn from index to length gn 
 l algorithm o gn 
 l algorithm o gn 
 for each c in l do 
 for each c in l do 
 if c is an ancestor of c at o then 
 l the list l after adding element c 
 else if c is a descendant of c at o then 
 l the list l after adding element c 
 end if 
 end for 
 end for 
 else 
 gn the string gn after removing case and diacritics 
 if gn contains a geographic type qualifier then 
 t the substring of gn containing the type qualifier 
 gn the substring of gn with the type qualifier removed 
 l the list of concepts from o with name gn and type t 
 else 
 l the list of concepts from o with name gn 
 end if 
 end if 
 return the list l 
qualifiers can provide useful information for disambiguation the 
considered type qualifiers should also described at the ontologies 
 e g each geographic concept should be associated to a type that is 
also defined at the ontology such as country district or city 
ideally the geographical reference provided by the user should 
be disambiguated into a single ontology concept however this is 
not always possible since the user may not provide all the required 
information i e a type expression or a second qualifying location 
the output is therefore a list with the possible concepts being 
referred to by the user in a final step we propose to sort this list 
so that if a single concept is required as output we can use the one 
that is ranked higher the sorting procedure reflects the likelihood 
of each concept being indeed the one referred to we propose to 
rank concepts according to the following heuristics 
 the geographical type expression associated with the 
ontology concept for the same name a country is more likely to 
be referenced than a city and in turn a city more likely to be 
referenced than a street 
 number of ancestors at the ontology top places at the 
ontology tend to be more general and are therefore more likely 
to be referenced in search engine queries 
 population count highly populated places are better known 
and therefore more likely to be referenced in queries 
 population counts from direct ancestors at the ontology 
subregions of highly populated places are better known and also 
more likely to be referenced in search engine queries 
 occurrence frequency over web documents e g google 
counts for the geographical names places names that occur 
more frequently over web documents are also more likely to 
be referenced in search engine queries 
 number of descendants at the ontology places that have 
more sub-regions tend to be more general and are therefore 
more likely to be mentioned in search engine queries 
 string size for the geographical names short names are more 
likely to be mentioned in search engine queries 
algorithm plus the ranking procedure can already handle gir 
queries where the where term is given separately from the what and 
relation terms however if the query is given in a single string we 
require the identification of the associated what relation where 
triple before disambiguating the where term into the corresponding 
ontology concepts this is described in the following section 
 handling single query strings 
algorithm provides the mechanism for separating a query string 
into a what relation where triple it uses algorithm to find 
the where term disambiguating it into a set of ontology concepts 
the algorithm starts by tokenizing the query string into 
individual words also taking care of removing case and diacritics we 
have a simple tokenizer that uses the space character as a word 
delimiter but we could also have a tokenization approach similar to 
the proposal of wang et al which relies on web occurrence 
statistics to avoid breaking collocations in the future we plan on 
testing if this different tokenization scheme can improve results 
next the algorithm tests different possible splits of the query 
building the what relation and where terms through 
concatenations of the individual tokens the relation term is matched against 
a list of possible values e g near at around or south 
of corresponding to the operators that are supported by the gir 
system note that is also the responsibility of the underlying gir 
system to interpret the actual meaning of the different spatial 
relations algorithm is used to check whether a where term 
constitutes a geographical reference or not we also check if the last 
word in the what term belongs to a list of exceptions containing for 
instance first names of people in different languages this ensures 
that a query like denzel washington is appropriately handled 
if the algorithm succeeds in finding valid relation and where 
terms then the corresponding triple is returned otherwise we 
return a triple with the what term equaling the query string and the 
relation and where terms set as empty if the entire query string 
constitutes a geographical reference we return a triple with the 
what term set to empty the where term equaling the query string 
and the relation term set the definition i e these queries 
should be answered with information about the given place 
references the algorithm also handles query strings where more 
than one geographical reference is provided using and or an 
equivalent preposition together with a recursive call to algorithm 
 a query like diamond trade in angola and south africa is 
algorithm get what relation where from a query string 
require o a geographical ontology 
require q a non-empty string with the query 
 q the string q after removing case and diacritics 
 tokens n an array of strings with the individual words of q 
 n the size of the tokens array 
 for index to n do 
 if index then 
 what concatenation of tokens index − 
 lastwhat tokens index − 
 else 
 what an empty string 
 lastwhat an empty string 
 end if 
 where concatenation of tokens index n 
 relation an empty string 
 for index index to n − do 
 relation concatenation of tokens index index 
 if relation is a valid geographical relation then 
 where concatenation of s index n 
 relation relation 
 end if 
 end for 
 if relation empty and lastwhat in an exception then 
 testgeo false 
 else 
 testgeo true 
 end if 
 if testgeo and algorithm where empty then 
 if where ends with and surroundings then 
 relation the string near 
 where the substring of where with and 
surroundings removed 
 end if 
 if what ends with and or similar then 
 what relation where algorithm what 
 where concatenation of where with where 
 end if 
 if relation an empty string then 
 if what an empty string then 
 relation the string definition 
 else 
 relation the string contained-at 
 end if 
 end if 
 else 
 what the string q 
 where an empty string 
 relation an empty string 
 end if 
 end for 
 return what relation where 
therefore appropriately handled finally if the geographical 
reference in the query is complemented with an expression similar to 
and its surroundings the spatial relation which is assumed to be 
contained-at if none is provided is changed to near 
 from search results to query locality 
the procedures given so far are appropriate for handling queries 
where a place reference is explicitly mentioned however the fact 
that a query can be associated with a geographical context may 
not be directly observable in the query itself but rather from the 
results returned for instance queries like recommended hotels 
for sigir or seafair lodging can be seen to refer to 
the city of seattle although they do not contain an explicit place 
reference we expect results to be about hotels in seattle 
in the cases where a query does not contain place references we 
start by assuming that the top results from a search engine represent 
the most popular and correct context and usage for the query we 
topic what relation where tgn concepts ml concepts 
vegetable exporters of europe vegetable exporters contained-at europe 
trade unions in europe trade unions contained-at europe 
roman cities in the uk and germany roman cities contained-at uk and germany 
cathedrals in europe cathedrals contained-at europe 
car bombings near madrid car bombings near madrid 
volcanos around quito volcanos near quito 
cities within km of frankfurt cities near frankfurt 
russian troops in south ern caucasus russian troops in south ern contained-at caucasus 
cities near active volcanoes this topic could not be appropriately handled - the relation and where terms are returned empty 
japanese rice imports this topic could not be appropriately handled - the relation and where terms are returned empty 
table example topics from the geoclef evaluation campaigns and the corresponding what relation where triples 
then propose to use the distributional characteristics of 
geographical scopes previously assigned to the documents corresponding to 
these top results in a previous work we presented a text mining 
approach for assigning documents with corresponding 
geographical scopes defined at an ontology that worked as an offline 
preprocessing stage in a gir system this pre-processing step is a 
fundamental stage of gir and it is reasonable to assume that this 
kind of information would be available on any system similarly to 
wang et al we could also attempt to process the results on-line 
in order to detect place references in the documents however 
a gir system already requires the offline stage 
for the top n documents given at the results we check the 
geographic scopes that were assigned to them if a significant portion 
of the results are assigned to the same scope than the query can be 
seen to be related to the corresponding geographic concept this 
assumption could even be relaxed for instance by checking if the 
documents belong to scopes that are hierarchically related 
 evaluation experiments 
we used three different ontologies in evaluation experiments 
namely the getty thesaurus of geographic names tgn and 
two specific resources developed at our group here referred to as 
the pt and ml ontologies tgn and ml include global 
geographical information in multiple languages although tgn is 
considerably larger while the pt ontology focuses on the portuguese 
territory with a high detail place types are also different across 
ontologies as for instance pt includes street names and postal 
addresses whereas ml only goes to the level of cities the reader 
should refer to for a complete description of these resources 
our initial experiments used portuguese and english topics from 
the geoclef and evaluation campaigns topics in 
geoclef correspond to query strings that can be used as input to a gir 
system imageclef also included topics specifying place 
references and participants were encouraged to run their gir 
systems on them our experiments also considered this dataset for 
each topic we measured if algorithm was able to find the 
corresponding what relation where triple the ontologies used 
in this experiment were the tgn and ml as topics were given in 
multiple languages and covered the whole globe

table summary of results over clef topics 
table illustrates some of the topics and table summarizes 
the obtained results the tables show that the proposed technique 
adequately handles most of these queries a manual inspection of 
the ontology concepts that were returned for each case also revealed 
that the where term was being correctly disambiguated note that 
the tgn ontology indeed added some ambiguity as for instance 
names like madrid can correspond to many different places around 
the globe it should also be noted that some of the considered 
topics are very hard for an automated system to handle some of them 
were ambiguous e g in japanese rice imports the query can 
be said to refer either rice imports in japan or imports of japanese 
rice and others contained no direct geographical references e g 
cities near active volcanoes besides these very hard cases we 
also missed some topics due to their usage of place adjectives and 
specific regions that are not defined at the ontologies e g 
environmental concerns around the scottish trossachs 
in a second experiment we used a sample of around 
real search engine queries the objective was to see if a 
significant number of these queries were geographical in nature also 
checking if the algorithm did not produce many mistakes by 
classifying a query as geographical when that was not the case the 
portuguese ontology was used in this experiment and queries were 
taken from the logs of a portuguese web search engine available 
at www tumba pt table summarizes the obtained results many 
queries were indeed geographical around although 
previous studies reported values above a manual inspection 
showed that the algorithm did not produce many false positives 
and the geographical queries were indeed correctly split into correct 
 what relation where triple the few mistakes we encountered 
were related to place names that were more frequently used in other 
contexts e g in teófilo braga we have the problem that braga 
is a portuguese district and teófilo braga was a well known 
portuguese writer and politician the addition of more names to the 
exception list can provide a workaround for most of these cases 
value 
num queries 
num queries without geographical references 
num queries with geographical references 
table results from an experiment with search engine logs 
we also tested the procedure for detecting queries that are 
implicitly geographical with a small sample of queries from the logs 
for instance for the query estádio do dragão e g home stadium 
for a soccer team from porto the correct geographical context can 
be discovered from the analysis of the results more than of 
the top results are assigned with the scope porto for future 
work we plan on using a larger collection of queries to evaluate 
this aspect besides queries from the search engine logs we also 
plan on using the names of well-known buildings monuments and 
other landmarks as they have a strong geographical connotation 
finally we also made a comparative experiment with popular 
geocoders maporama and microsoft s mappoint the objective 
was to compare algorithm with other approaches in terms of 
being able to correctly disambiguate a string with a place reference 
civil parishes from lisbon maporama mappoint ours 
coded refs out of 
avg time per ref msec 
civil parishes from porto maporama mappoint ours 
coded refs out of 
avg time per ref msec 
table results from a comparison with geocoding services 
the portuguese ontology was used in this experiment taking as 
input the names of civil parishes from the portuguese municipalities 
of lisbon and porto and checking if the systems were able to 
disambiguate the full name e g campo grande lisboa or foz 
do douro porto into the correct geocode we specifically 
measured whether our approach was better at unambiguously returning 
geocodes given the place reference i e return the single correct 
code and providing results rapidly table shows the obtained 
results and the accuracy of our method seems comparable to the 
commercial geocoders note that for maporama and mappoint the 
times given at table include fetching results from the web but we 
have no direct way of accessing the geocoding algorithms in both 
cases fetching static content from the web servers takes around 
 milliseconds although our approach cannot unambiguously 
return the correct geocode in most cases only out of a total of 
 cases it nonetheless returns results that a human user can 
disambiguate e g for madalena lisboa we return both a street and 
a civil parish as opposed to the other systems that often did not 
produce results moreover if we consider the top geocode 
according to the ranking procedure described in section or if we use 
a type qualifier in the name e g civil parish of campo grande 
lisboa our algorithm always returns the correct geocode 
 conclusions 
this paper presented simple approaches for handling place 
references in search engine queries this is a hard text mining problem 
as queries are often ambiguous or underspecify information needs 
however our initial experiments indicate that for many queries the 
referenced places can be determined effectively unlike the 
techniques proposed by wang et al we mainly focused on 
recognizing spatial relations and associating place names to ontology 
concepts the proposed techniques were employed in the prototype 
system that we used for participating in geoclef in queries 
where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned we 
propose to use the results for the query exploiting geographic scopes 
previously assigned to these documents in the future we plan on 
doing a careful evaluation of this last approach another idea that 
we would like to test involves the integration of a spelling 
correction mechanism into algorithm so that incorrectly spelled 
place references can be matched to ontology concepts 
the proposed techniques for handling geographic queries can 
have many applications in improving gir systems or even general 
purpose search engines after place references are appropriately 
disambiguated into ontology concepts a gir system can use them 
to retrieve relevant results through the use of appropriate index 
structures e g indexing the spatial coordinates associated with 
ontology concepts and provided that the documents are also assigned 
to scopes corresponding to ontology concepts a different gir 
strategy can involve query expansion by taking the where terms 
from the query and using the ontology to add names from 
neighboring locations in a general purpose search engine and if a local 
query is detected we can forward users to a gir system which 
should be better suited for properly handling the query the regular 
google search interface already does this by presenting a link to 
google local when it detects a geographical query
