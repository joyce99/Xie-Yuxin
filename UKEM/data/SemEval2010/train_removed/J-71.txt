 introduction 
a wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have 
been developed to support hedging i e insuring against 
exposure to uncertain events and or speculative trading on 
uncertain events the dominant mechanism used in 
financial circles is the continuous double auction cda or in 
some cases the cda with market maker cdawmm the 
primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or 
bookmaker who essentially acts exactly as a market maker 
horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the 
pari-mutuel mechanism though there is no formal or 
logical separation between financial trading and wagering the 
two endeavors are socially considered distinct recently 
there has been a move to employ cdas or cdawmms for 
all types of wagering including on sports horse racing 
political events world news and many other uncertain events 
and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems 
for betting on financial markets these trends highlight the 
interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur 
the line between investing and betting some companies at 
the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially 
with some industry observers declaring the onset of a 
revolution in the wagering business 
each mechanism has pros and cons for the market 
institution and the participating traders a cda only matches 
willing traders and so poses no risk whatsoever for the 
market institution but a cda can suffer from illiquidity in the 
form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if 
trading is light and thus markets are thin a successful cda 
must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem traders are 
attracted to liquid markets but liquid markets require a large 
number of traders a cdawmm and the similar bookie 
mechanism have built-in liquidity but at a cost the market 
maker itself usually affiliated with the market institution is 
exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses both the 
cda and cdawmm offer incentives for traders to leverage 
information continuously as soon as that information 
becomes available as a result prices are known to capture 
the current state of information exceptionally well 
pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity 
anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time without 
the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a 
market maker pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the 
market institution since they only redistribute money from 
losing wagers to winning wagers however pari-mutuel

kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives 
over time since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets 
until either all information is revealed or the market 
is about to close for this reason pari-mutuel prices prior 
to the market s close cannot be considered a reflection of 
current information pari-mutuel market participants 
cannot buy low and sell high they cannot cash out gains or 
limit losses before the event outcome is revealed because 
the process whereby information arrives continuously over 
time is the rule rather than the exception the applicability 
of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a 
large number of settings 
in this paper i develop a new mechanism suitable for 
hedging speculating and wagering called a dynamic 
parimutuel market dpm a dpm can be thought of as a 
hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a cda a dpm is 
indeed pari-mutuel in nature meaning that it acts only to 
redistribute money from some traders to others and so 
exposes the market institution to no volatility no risk a 
constant pre-determined subsidy is required to start the 
market the subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and 
might conceivably come from traders via antes or 
transaction fees rather than the market institution though a 
nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading 
and information aggregation a dpm has the infinite 
liquidity of a pari-mutuel market traders can always purchase 
shares in any outcome at any time at some price 
automatically set by the market institution a dpm is also able 
to react to and incorporate information arriving over time 
like a cda the market institution changes the price for 
particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering 
if a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of 
wagers its price increases if an outcome receives relatively 
few wagers its price decreases prices are computed 
automatically using a price function which can differ depending 
on what properties are desired the price function 
determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal 
quantity of shares the total cost for purchasing n shares 
is computed as the integral of the price function from to 
n the complexity of the price function can be hidden from 
traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots 
of shares e g lots of shares as is common practice in 
cdas and cdawmms dpm prices do reflect current 
information and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock 
in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed 
while there is always a market maker willing to accept buy 
orders there is not a market maker accepting sell orders 
and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling instead selling 
is accomplished via a standard cda mechanism traders 
can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome 
than they already own 
 background and related work 
 pari-mutuel markets 
pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races 
 dog races and jai alai games in a pari-mutuel 
market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually 
exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time 
in the future after the true outcome becomes known all 
of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect 
outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct 
outcome in direct proportion to the amount they wagered 
more formally if there are k mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive outcomes e g k horses exactly one of which will win 
and m m mk dollars are bet on each outcome and 
outcome i occurs then everyone who bet on an outcome 
j i loses their wager while everyone who bet on outcome 
i receives 
pk 
j mj mi dollars for every dollar they wagered 
that is every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of 
all money wagered an equivalent way to think about the 
redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is 
refunded then receives an equal share of all remaining money 
bet on the losing outcomes or 
p 
j i mj mi dollars 
in practice the market institution e g the racetrack 
first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered 
usually about in the united states then redistributes 
whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to 
their amount bet 
consider a simple example with two outcomes a and b 
the outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
meaning that pr a âˆ§ b and pr a pr b suppose 
 is bet on a and on b now suppose that a 
occurs e g horse a wins the race people who wagered on 
b lose their money or in total people who wagered 
on a win and each receives a proportional share of the total 
 wagered ignoring fees specifically each wager 
on a entitles its owner a share of the or 
every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal 
payoff regardless of when the wager was placed or how much 
money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the 
wager was placed the only state that matters is the final 
state the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when 
the market closes and the identity of the correct outcome 
as a result there is a disincentive to place a wager early 
if there is any chance that new information might become 
available moreover there are no guarantees about the 
payoff rate of a particular bet except that it will be nonnegative 
if the correct outcome is chosen payoff rates can fluctuate 
arbitrarily until the market closes so a second reason not 
to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final 
payout rates this is in contrast to cdas and cdawmms like 
the stock market where incentives exist to invest as soon as 
new information is revealed 
pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their 
chosen outcome or even cancel their bet prior to the market s 
close however they cannot cash out of the market early 
to either lock in gains or limit losses if new information 
favors one outcome over another as is possible in a cda 
or a cdawmm if bettors can cancel or change their bets 
then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible 
every dollar wagered is worth exactly up until the 
market s close-no one would buy at greater than and no one 
would sell at less than pari-mutuel bettors must wait 
until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss 
unlike a cda in a pari-mutuel market anyone can place 
a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense 
infinite liquidity for buying a cdawmm also has built-in 
liquidity but at the cost of significant risk for the market 
maker in a pari-mutuel market since money is only 
redistributed among bettors the market institution itself has no 
risk the main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that 
it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain 
asset at some instant in time it is ill-suited for situations 
where information arrives over time continuously updating 
the estimated value of the asset-situations common in 
al 
most all trading and wagering scenarios there is no notion 
of buying low and selling high as occurs in a cda where 
buying when few others are buying and the price is low is 
rewarded more than buying when many others are buying 
 and the price is high perhaps for this reason in most 
dynamic environments financial mechanisms like the cda 
that can react in real-time to changing information are more 
typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging 
since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an 
asset at a single instant in time a repeated pari-mutuel 
market where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at 
consecutive intervals could in principle capture changing 
information dynamics but running multiple consecutive 
markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market 
also in each individual pari-mutuel market the incentives 
would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending 
time of that particular market this last problem might 
be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each 
individual pari-mutuel market 
in laboratory experiments pari-mutuel markets have shown 
a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate 
information dispersed among traders at least for a single snapshot 
in time a similar ability has been recognized at real 
racetracks 
 financial markets 
in the financial world wagering on the outcomes of 
uncertain future propositions is also common the typical market 
mechanism used is the continuous double auction cda 
the term securities market in economics and finance 
generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating 
on uncertain events is possible examples include stock 
markets like nasdaq options markets like the cboe 
futures markets like the cme other derivatives markets 
insurance markets political stock markets idea futures 
markets decision markets and even market games 
 securities markets generally have an economic 
and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering 
they allow traders to hedge risk or to insure against 
undesirable outcomes so if a particular outcome has disutility 
for a trader he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering 
for the outcome to arrange for compensation in case the 
outcome occurs in this sense buying automobile insurance 
is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event 
will occur similarly buying a put option which is useful 
as a hedge for a stockholder is a bet that the underlying 
stock will go down in practice agents engage in a mixture 
of hedging and speculating and there is no clear dividing 
line between the two like pari-mutuel markets often 
prices in financial markets are excellent information 
aggregators yielding very accurate forecasts of future events 
 
a cda constantly matches orders to buy an asset with 
orders to sell if at any time one party is willing to buy 
one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid while another 
party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of 
pask and pbid is greater than or equal to pask then the two 
parties transact at some price between pbid and pask if 
the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price then no 
transactions occur in a cda the bid and ask prices rapidly 
change as new information arrives and traders reassess the 
value of the asset since the auctioneer only matches willing 
bidders the auctioneer takes on no risk however buyers 
can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell for 
any transaction to occur there must be a counterparty on 
the other side willing to accept the trade 
as a result when few traders participate in a cda it may 
become illiquid meaning that not much trading activity 
occurs the spread between the highest bid price and the 
lowest ask price may be very large or one or both queues may 
be completely empty discouraging trading 
one way to 
induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing 
to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular 
prices we call this mechanism a cda with market maker 
 cdawmm 
conceptually the market maker is just like 
any other trader but typically is willing to accept a much 
larger volume of trades the market maker may be a 
person or may be an automated algorithm adding a market 
maker to the system increases liquidity but exposes the 
market maker to risk now instead of only matching trades the 
system actually takes on risk of its own and depending on 
what happens in the future may lose considerable amounts 
of money 
 wagering markets 
the typical las vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions 
much like a market maker in a cda in this case the 
market institution the book or house sets the odds 
initially 
according to expert opinion and later in response to the 
relative level of betting on the various outcomes unlike in a 
pari-mutuel environment whenever a wager is placed with 
a bookmaker the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the 
time of the bet the bookmaker profits by offering different 
odds for the two sides of the bet essentially defining a 
bidask spread while odds may change in response to changing 
information any bets made at previously set odds remain 
in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet this 
is precisely in analogy to a cdawmm one difference 
between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former 
usually operates in a take it or leave it mode bettors 
cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue they 
can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by 
the bookmaker still the bookmaker certainly reacts to 
bettor demand like a market maker the bookmaker exposes 
itself to significant risk sports betting markets have also 
been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts 
 
 market scoring rule 
hanson s market scoring rule msr is a new 
mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some 
properties in common with a dpm like a dpm an msr can be 
conceptualized as an automated market maker always 
willing to accept a trade on any event at some price an msr 
requires a patron to subsidize the market the patron s final 
loss is variable and thus technically implies a degree of risk 
though the maximum loss is bounded an msr maintains 
a probability distribution over all events at any time any 
 
thin markets do occur often in practice and can be 
seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on 
http tradesports com or in some financial options 
markets for example 
 
a very clear example of a cdawmm is the interactive 
betting market on http wsex com 
 
or alternatively the bookmaker sets the game line in order 
to provide even-money odds 
 
trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change 
any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that 
pays off according to a scoring rule e g the logarithmic 
scoring rule as long as that trader also agrees to pay 
off the most recent person to change the distribution in the 
limit of a single trader the mechanism behaves like a 
scoring rule suitable for polling a single agent for its probability 
distribution in the limit of many traders it produces a 
combined estimate since the market essentially always has a 
complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes the 
mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity 
an msr is not pari-mutuel in nature as the patron in 
general injects a variable amount of money into the system an 
msr provides a two-sided automated market maker while 
a dpm provides a one-sided automated market maker in 
an msr the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at 
the time of the trade while in a dpm the vector of payoffs 
across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at 
the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the 
market s close while the mechanisms are quite different-and 
so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the 
properties and motivations of dpms and msrs are quite 
similar 
hanson shows how msrs are especially well suited for 
allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes the 
patron s payment for subsidizing trading on all n 
possible 
combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of 
subsidizing the n event marginals independently the mechanism 
was planned for use in the policy analysis market pam a 
futures market in middle east related outcomes and funded 
by darpa until a media firestorm killed the project 
as of this writing the founders of pam were considering 
reopening under private control 
 a dynamic pari-mutuel market 
 high-level description 
in contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market where each 
dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff in a dpm 
each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on 
the state of wagering at the time of purchase so a wager 
on a at a time when most others are wagering on b offers a 
greater possible profit than a wager on a when most others 
are also wagering on a 
a natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a 
bet is to say that at any given time a certain amount of 
money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome 
the other purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal 
stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur 
the payoff is variable because when few people are betting 
on an outcome shares will generally be cheaper than at a 
time when many people are betting that outcome there 
is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares new 
shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds 
for simplicity all analyses in this paper consider the 
binary outcome case generalizing to multiple discrete 
outcomes should be straightforward denote the two outcomes 
a and b the outcomes are mutually exclusive and

haustive denote the instantaneous price per share of a as 
p and the price per share of b as p denote the payoffs 
per share as p and p respectively these four numbers 
p p p p are the key numbers that traders must track 
and understand note that the price is set at the time of the 
wager the payoff per share is finalized only after the event 
outcome is revealed 
at any time a trader can purchase an infinitesimal 
quantity of shares of a at price p and similarly for b however 
since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased 
the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a 
price function from to n the use of continuous functions 
and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the 
automated market maker s sell orders into discrete lots of 
say shares each these ask orders can be 
automatically entered into the system by the market institution so 
that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar 
cda we examine this interface issue in more detail below 
in section 
for our analysis we introduce the following additional 
notation denote m as the total amount of money wagered 
on a m as the total amount of money wagered on b 
t m m as the total amount of money wagered on 
both sides n as the total number of shares purchased of 
a and n as the total number of shares purchased of b 
there are many ways to formulate the price function 
several natural price functions are outlined below each is 
motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on 
price dynamics 
 advantages and disadvantages 
to my knowledge a dpm is the only known mechanism 
for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the 
following properties guaranteed liquidity no risk 
for the market institution and continuous incorporation 
of information a standard pari-mutuel fails a cda 
fails a cdawmm the bookmaker mechanism and an 
msr all fail even though technically an msr exposes 
its patron to risk i e a variable future payoff the 
patron s maximum loss is bounded so the distinction between 
a dpm and an msr in terms of these three properties is 
more technical than practical 
dpm traders can cash out of the market early just like 
stock market traders to lock in a profit or limit a loss an 
action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel 
a dpm also has some drawbacks the payoff for a 
wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade and 
on the final payoff per share at the market s close this 
contrasts with the cda variants where the payoff vector 
across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the 
trade so a trader s strategic optimization problem is 
complicated by the need to predict the final values of p and 
p if p changes according to a random walk then traders 
can take the current p as an unbiased estimate of the 
final p greatly decreasing the complexity of their 
optimization if p does not change according to a random walk 
the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging 
and speculating though optimization may be difficult and 
determining a measure of the market s aggregate opinion of 
the probabilities of a and b may be difficult we discuss 
the implications of random walk behavior further below in 
section in the discussion surrounding assumption 
a second drawback of a dpm is its one-sided nature 
 
while an automated market maker always stands ready to 
accept buy orders there is no corresponding market maker 
to accept sell orders traders must sell to each other 
using a standard cda mechanism for example by posting an 
ask order at a price at or below the market maker s current 
ask price traders can also always hedge-sell by 
purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker 
thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it 
 redistribution rule 
in a standard pari-mutuel market payoffs can be 
computed in either of two equivalent ways each winning 
wager receives a refund of the initial paid plus an equal 
share of all losing wagers or each winning wager 
receives an equal share of all wagers winning or losing 
because each dollar always earns an equal share of the payoff 
the two formulations are precisely the same 
 
mlose 
mwin 
 
mwin mlose 
mwin 
 
in a dynamic pari-mutuel market because each dollar is 
not equally weighted the two formulations are distinct and 
lead to significantly different price functions and 
mechanisms each with different potentially desirable properties 
we consider each case in turn the next section analyzes 
case where only losing money is redistributed section 
examines case where all money is redistributed 
 dpm i losing money 
redistributed 
for the case where the initial payments on winning bets 
are refunded and only losing money is redistributed the 
respective payoffs per share are simply 
p 
m 
n 
p 
m 
n 
 
so if a occurs shareholders of a receive all of their 
initial payment back plus p dollars per share owned while 
shareholders of b lose all money wagered similarly if b 
occurs shareholders of b receive all of their initial payment 
back plus p dollars per share owned while shareholders of 
a lose all money wagered 
without loss of generality i will analyze the market from 
the perspective of a deriving prices and payoffs for a only 
the equations for b are symmetric 
the trader s per-share expected value for purchasing an 
infinitesimal quantity of shares of a is 
e shares 
 pr a Â· e p a âˆ’ âˆ’ pr a Â· p 
e shares 
 pr a Â· e 
 
m 
n 
Ë› 
Ë› 
Ë› 
Ë› a 
 
âˆ’ âˆ’ pr a Â· p 
where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of a pr a 
is the trader s belief in the probability of a and p is the 
instantaneous price per share of a for an infinitesimal 
quantity of shares e p a is the trader s expectation of the 
payoff per share of a after the market closes and given that 
a occurs this is a subtle point the value of p does not 
matter if b occurs since in this case shares of a are 
worthless and the current value of p does not necessarily matter 
as this may change as trading continues so in order to 
determine the expected value of shares of a the trader must 
estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be 
in the end after the market closes if a occurs 
if e shares a risk-neutral trader should purchase 
shares of a how many shares this depends on the price 
function determining p in general p increases as more 
shares are purchased the risk-neutral trader should 
continue purchasing shares until e shares a 
riskaverse trader will generally stop purchasing shares before 
driving e shares all the way to zero assuming 
riskneutrality the trader s optimization problem is to choose a 
number of shares n â‰¥ of a to purchase in order to 
maximize 
e n shares pr a Â·nÂ·e p a âˆ’ âˆ’pr a Â· 
z n 
 
p n dn 
 
it s easy to see that the same value of n can be solved for by 
finding the number of shares required to drive e shares 
to zero that is find n â‰¥ satisfying 
 pr a Â· e p a âˆ’ âˆ’ pr a Â· p n 
if such a n exists otherwise n 
 market probability 
as traders who believe that e shares of a 
purchase shares of a and traders who believe that e shares 
of b purchase shares of b the prices p and p 
change according to a price function as prescribed below 
the current prices in a sense reflect the market s opinion as 
a whole of the relative probabilities of a and b 
assuming an efficient marketplace the market as a whole 
considers e shares since the mechanisms is a zero sum 
game for example if market participants in aggregate felt 
that e shares then there would be net demand for 
a driving up the price of a until e shares define 
mpr a to be the market probability of a or the 
probability of a inferred by assuming that e shares we 
can consider mpr a to be the aggregate probability of a 
as judged by the market as a whole mpr a is the solution 
to 
 mpr a Â· e p a âˆ’ âˆ’ mpr a Â· p 
solving we get 
mpr a 
p 
p e p a 
 
at this point we make a critical assumption in order to 
greatly simplify the analysis we assume that 
e p a p 
that is we assume that the current value for the payoff per 
share of a is the same as the expected final value of the 
payoff per share of a given that a occurs this is certainly true 
for the last infinitesimal wager before the market closes 
it s not obvious however that the assumption is true well 
before the market s close basically we are assuming that 
the value of p moves according to an unbiased random 
walk the current value of p is the best expectation of 
its future value i conjecture that there are reasonable 
market efficiency conditions under which assumption is true 
though i have not been able to prove that it arises naturally 
from rational trading we examine scenarios below in which 
 
assumption seems especially plausible nonetheless the 
assumption effects our analysis only regardless of whether 
 is true each price function derived below implies a 
welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play if traders 
can assume that is true then their optimization 
problem is greatly simplified however optimizing does 
not depend on the assumption and traders can still optimize 
by strategically projecting the final expected payoff in 
whatever complicated way they desire so the utility of dpm for 
hedging and speculating does not necessarily hinge on the 
truth of assumption on the other hand the ability to 
easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from 
market prices does depend on 
 price functions 
a variety of price functions seem reasonable each 
exhibiting various properties and implying differing market 
probabilities 
 price function i price of a equals payoff of b 
one natural price function to consider is to set the price 
per share of a equal to the payoff per share of b and set 
the price per share of b equal to the payoff per share of a 
that is 
p p 
p p 
enforcing this relationship reduces the dimensionality of 
the system from four to two simplifying the interface traders 
need only track two numbers instead of four the 
relationship makes sense since new information supporting a 
should encourage purchasing of shares a driving up both 
the price of a and the payoff of b and driving down the 
price of b and the payoff of a in this setting assumption 
 seems especially reasonable since if an efficient market 
hypothesis leads prices to follow a random walk than payoffs 
must also follow a random walk 
the constraints lead to the following derivation of the 
market probability

the constraints specify the instantaneous 
relationship between payoff and price from this we can derive 
how prices change when non-infinitesimal shares are 
purchased let n be the number of shares purchased and let m 
be the amount of money spent purchasing n shares note 
that p dm dn the instantaneous price per share and

the notion of buying infinitesimal shares or 
integrating costs over a continuous function are probably foreign 
to most traders a more standard interface can be 
implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares 
for example lots of shares then ask orders of 
shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically 
placed by the market institution for example the 
market institution can place an ask order for shares at 
price m another ask order for shares at price 
 m âˆ’m a third ask for shares at m âˆ’ 
m etc in this way the market looks more 
familiar to traders like a typical cda with a number of ask 
orders at various prices automatically available a trader 
buying less than shares would pay a bit more than if 
the true cost were computed using but the discretized 
interface would probably be more intuitive and transparent 
to the majority of traders 
the above equations assume that all money that comes in 
is eventually returned or redistributed in other words the 
mechanism is a zero sum game and the market institution 
takes no portion of the money this could be generalized so 
that the market institution always takes a certain amount 
or a certain percent or a certain amount per transaction or 
a certain percent per transaction before money in returned 
or redistributed 
finally note that the above price function is undefined 
when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero so 
the system must begin with some positive amount on both 
sides and some positive number of shares outstanding on 
both sides these initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in 
principle but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the 
incentives of traders to participate also the smaller the 
initial amounts the more each new dollar effects the prices 
the initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from 
the market institution or a patron which i ll call a seed 
wager or from a portion of the fees charged which i ll call 
an ante wager 
 price function ii price of a proportional to 
money on a 
a second price function can be derived by requiring the 
ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered 
 
that is 
p 
p 
 
m 
m 
 
in other words the price of a is proportional to the amount 
of money wagered on a and similarly for b this seems like 
a particularly natural way to set the price since the more 
money that is wagered on one side the cheaper becomes a 
share on the other side in exactly the same proportion 
using equation along with and we can derive 
the implied market probability

note that as required p m 
âˆš 
n n and p p 
 m m if one uses the above price function then the 
market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the 
 instantaneous prices of a and b always equals the ratio of the 
amounts wagered on a and b which seems fairly natural 
note that as before the mechanism can be modified to 
collect transaction fees of some kind also note that seed or 
ante wagers are required to initialize the system 
 dpm ii all money redistributed 
above we examined the policy of refunding winning 
wagers and redistributing only losing wagers in this section 
we consider the second policy mentioned in section all 
money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to 
winning wagers 
for the case where all money is redistributed the 
respective payoffs per share are 
p 
m m 
n 
 
t 
n 
p 
m m 
n 
 
t 
n 
 
where t m m is the total amount of money wagered 
on both sides so if a occurs shareholders of a lose their 
initial price paid but receive p dollars per share owned 
shareholders of b simply lose all money wagered similarly 
if b occurs shareholders of b lose their initial price paid 
but receive p dollars per share owned shareholders of a 
lose all money wagered 
in this case the trader s per-share expected value for 
purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of a is 
e shares 
 pr a Â· e p a âˆ’ p 
a risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of 
shares n â‰¥ of a to purchase in order to maximize 
e n shares pr a Â· n Â· e p a âˆ’

the same value of n can be solved for by finding the number 
of shares required to drive e shares to zero that is 
find n â‰¥ satisfying 
 pr a Â· e p a âˆ’ p n 
if such a n exists otherwise n 
 market probability 
in this case mpr a the aggregate probability of a as 
judged by the market as a whole is the solution to 
 mpr a Â· e p a âˆ’ p 
solving we get 
mpr a 
p 
e p a 
 
as before we make the simplifying assumption that 
the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff 
per share the assumption is critical for our analysis but 
may not be required for a practical implementation 
 price functions 
for the case where all money is distributed the 
constraints that keep the price of a equal to the payoff of b 
and vice versa do not lead to the derivation of a coherent 
price function 
a reasonable price function can be derived from the 
constraint employed in section where we require that 
the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered 
that is p p m m in other words the price of a is 
proportional to the amount of money wagered on a and 
similarly for b 
 
using equations and we can derive the implied 
market probability

interestingly this is the same market probability derived in

the constraints that the price of a equal the payoff of b and 
vice versa

quantity of shares is

note that we solved for n m rather than m n i could not 
find a closed-form solution for m n as was derived for the 
two other cases above still n m can be used to determine 
how many shares can be purchased for m dollars and the 
inverse function can be approximated to any degree 
numerically from n m we can also compute the price function

where 
denom m m m n m âˆ’ m m n 
 t m m n ln

note that as required p p m m if one uses 
the above price function then the market dynamics will be 
such that the ratio of the instantaneous prices of a and b 
always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on a and 
b 
this price function has another desirable property it acts 
such that the expected value of wagering on a and 
simultaneously wagering on b equals zero assuming that 
is e of a of b the derivation is omitted 
 comparing dpm i and ii 
the main advantage of refunding winning wagers dpm 
i is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed 
to at least break even the main disadvantage of 
refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous each 
share of a for example is actually composed of two distinct 
parts the refund or a lottery ticket that pays p if a 
occurs where p is the price paid per share and one share 
of the final payoff p if a occurs this complicates the 
implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market 
early which we will examine below in section when all 
money is redistributed dpm ii shares are homogeneous 
each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final 
payoff because shares are homogenous the 
implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward as we shall see in 
section on the other hand because initial prices paid 
are not refunded for winning bets there is a chance that if 
prices swing wildly enough a wager on the correct outcome 
might actually lose money traders must be aware that if 
they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles 
allowing many others to get in at a much lower price they 
may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome from 
informal experiments i don t believe this eventuality would 
be common but nonetheless it requires care in 
communicating to traders the possible risks one potential fix would be 
for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going 
too low endangering an investor on the correct outcome at 
this point the market maker could artificially stop lowering 
the price sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in 
below the market maker s price but in this way the system 
could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at 
least breaks even 
 other variations 
a simple ascending price function would set p Î±m 
and p Î±m where Î± in this case prices would only 
go up for the case of all money being redistributed this 
would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on 
the correct outcome even though the market maker s price 
only rises the going price may fall well below the market 
maker s price as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket 
i have derived price functions for several other cases using 
the same methodology above each price function may have 
its own desirable properties but it s not clear which is best 
or even that a single best method exists further analyses 
and more importantly empirical investigations are required 
to answer these questions 
 aftermarkets 
a key advantage of dpm over a standard pari-mutuel 
market is the ability to cash out of the market before it 
closes in order to take a profit or limit a loss this is 
accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the 
same queue as the market maker so traders can sell the 
shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the 
market maker or traders can place a limit sell order at any 
price buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at 
the lower prices first before purchasing new shares from the 
market maker 
 aftermarket for dpm ii 
for the second main case explored above where all money 
 
is redistributed allowing an aftermarket is simple in fact 
aftermarket may be a poor descriptor buying and selling 
are both fully integrated into the same mechanism every 
share is worth precisely the same amount so traders can 
simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker 
in order to sell their shares new buyers will accept the 
lowest ask price whether it comes from the market maker or 
another trader in this way traders can cash out early and 
walk away with their current profit or loss assuming they 
can find a willing buyer 
 aftermarket for dpm i 
when winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers 
are redistributed each share is potentially worth a different 
amount depending on how much was paid for it so it is not 
as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket however an 
aftermarket is still possible in fact much of the complexity 
can be hidden from traders so it looks nearly as simple as 
placing a sell order on the queue 
in this case shares are not homogenous each share of a 
is actually composed of two distinct parts the refund of 
p Â· a dollars and the payoff of p Â· a dollars where p 
is the per-share price paid and a is the indicator function 
equalling if a occurs and otherwise one can 
imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell 
these two respective components however it is possible to 
automate the two aftermarkets by automatically bundling 
them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the 
central dpm in this way traders can cash out by placing 
sell orders on the same queue as the dpm market maker 
effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two 
separate aftermarkets the bundling mechanism works as 
follows suppose the current price for share of a is p a 
buyer agrees to purchase the share at p the buyer pays 
p dollars and receives p Â· a p Â· a dollars if there is 
enough inventory in the aftermarkets the buyer s share is 
constructed by bundling together p Â· a from the first 
aftermarket and p Â· a from the second aftermarket the seller 
in the first aftermarket receives p mpr a dollars and the 
seller in the second aftermarket receives p mpr b dollars 
 pseudo aftermarket for dpm i 
there is an alternative pseudo aftermarket that s 
possible for the case of dpm i that does not require bundling 
consider a share of a purchased for the share is 
composed of Â· a and p Â· a now suppose the current price 
has moved from to per share and the trader wants to 
cash out at a profit the trader can sell share at market 
price share for receiving all of the initial 
investment back and retaining share of a the share is 
worth either some positive amount or nothing depending 
on the outcome and the final payoff so the trader is left 
with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or 
her initial investment the trader has essentially cashed out 
and locked in his or her gains now suppose instead that 
the price moves downward from to per share the 
trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for 
 the buyer gets the share plus Â· a the buyer s price 
refunded the trader seller gets the plus what remains 
of the original price refunded or Â· a the trader s loss 
is now limited to at most instead of if a occurs the 
trader breaks even if b occurs the trader loses 
also note that-in either dpm formulation-traders can 
always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without 
the need for any type of aftermarket 
 conclusions 
i have presented a new market mechanism for wagering 
on or hedging against a future uncertain event called a 
dynamic pari-mutuel market dpm the mechanism 
combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a 
parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a cda making 
it suitable for continuous information aggregation to my 
knowledge all existing mechanisms-including the standard 
pari-mutuel market the cda the cdawmm the bookie 
mechanism and the msr-exhibit at most two of the three 
properties an msr is the closest to a dpm in terms of 
these properties if not in terms of mechanics given some 
natural constraints on price dynamics i have derived in 
closed form the implied price functions which encode how 
prices change continuously as shares are purchased the 
interface for traders looks much like the familiar cda with 
the system acting as an automated market maker willing 
to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price 
i have explored two main variations of a dpm one where 
only losing money is redistributed and one where all money 
is redistributed each has its own pros and cons and each 
supports several reasonable price functions i have described 
the workings of an aftermarket so that traders can cash out 
of the market early like in a cda to lock in their gains 
or limit their losses an operation that is not possible in a 
standard pari-mutuel setting 
 future work 
this paper reports the results of an initial investigation of 
the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market many avenues 
for future work present themselves including the following 
 random walk conjecture the most important 
question mark in my mind is whether the random walk 
assumption can be proven under reasonable market 
efficiency conditions and if not how severely it effects 
the practicality of the system 
 incentive analysis formally what are the 
incentives for traders to act on new information and when 
how does the level of initial subsidy effect trader 
incentives 
 laboratory experiments and field tests this 
paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics 
of the mechanism however the true test of the 
mechanism s ability to serve as an instrument for hedging 
wagering or information aggregation is to test it with 
real traders in a realistic environment in reality how 
do people behave when faced with a dpm mechanism 
 dpm call market i have derived the price functions 
to react to wagers on one outcome at a time the 
mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on 
both sides then update the prices wholistically rather 
than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers 
 real-valued variables i believe the mechanisms in 
this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 
 
outcomes and multiple real-valued outcomes that 
always sum to some constant value e g multiple 
percentage values that must sum to however the 
generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary 
range is less clear and open for future development 
 compound combinatorial betting i believe that 
dpm may be well suited for compound or 
combinatorial betting for many of the same reasons 
that market scoring rules are well suited for the 
task dpm may also have some computational 
advantages over msr though this remains to be seen
