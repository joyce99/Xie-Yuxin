we embark on a systematic analysis of the power and 
limitations of iterative combinatorial auctions most existing 
iterative combinatorial auctions are based on repeatedly 
suggesting prices for bundles of items and querying the bidders 
for their demand under these prices we prove a large 
number of results showing the boundaries of what can be 
achieved by auctions of this kind we first focus on auctions 
that use a polynomial number of demand queries and then 
we analyze the power of different kinds of ascending-price

 introduction 
combinatorial auctions have recently received a lot of 
attention in a combinatorial auction a set m of m 
nonidentical items are sold in a single auction to n competing 
bidders the bidders have preferences regarding the bundles 
of items that they may receive the preferences of bidder i 
are specified by a valuation function vi m 
→ r 
 where 
vi s denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the 
bundle of items s we assume free disposal i e that the 
vi s are monotone non-decreasing the usual goal of the 
auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare 
p 
i vi si where the 
allocation s sn must be a partition of the items 
applications include many complex resource allocation problems 
and in fact combinatorial auctions may be viewed as the 
common abstraction of many complex resource allocation 
problems combinatorial auctions face both economic and 
computational difficulties and are a central problem in the 
recently active border of economic theory and computer 
science a forthcoming book addresses many of the issues 
involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial 
auctions 
the design of a combinatorial auction involves many 
considerations in this paper we focus on just one central 
issue the communication between bidders and the allocation 
mechanism - preference elicitation transferring all 
information about bidders preferences requires an infeasible 
 exponential in m amount of communication thus 
direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare 
their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for 
very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder 
preferences we have therefore seen a multitude of suggested 
iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly 
interacts with the different bidders aiming to adaptively 
elicit enough information about the bidders preferences as 
to be able to find a good optimal or close to optimal 
allocation 
most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by 
maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and 
repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the 
bundles under the current set of prices and then updating 
the set of bundle prices according to the replies received 
 e g effectively such an iterative 
auction accesses the bidders preferences by repeatedly making 
the following type of demand query to bidders query to 
bidder i a vector of bundle prices p p s s⊆m answer 
a bundle of items s ⊆ m that maximizes vi s − p s 
these types of queries are very natural in an economic 
setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the 
bidders some auctions called item-price or linear-price 
auctions specify a price pi for each item and the price of any 
given bundle s is always linear p s 
p 
i∈s pi other 
auctions called bundle-price auctions allow specifying 
arbitrary non-linear prices p s for bundles another 
important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is 
 
based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous 
prices in some auctions the prices that are presented to the 
bidders are always the same anonymous prices in other 
auctions non-anonymous different bidders may face 
different discriminatory vectors of prices in ascending-price 
auctions forcing prices to be anonymous may be a 
significant restriction 
in this paper we embark on a systematic analysis of the 
computational power of iterative auctions that are based 
on demand queries we do not aim to present auctions for 
practical use but rather to understand the limitations and 
possibilities of these kinds of auctions in the first part of 
this paper our main question is what can be done using a 
polynomial number of these types of queries that is 
polynomial in the main parameters of the problem n m and the 
number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi s 
note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking 
about sub-linear time algorithms the input size here is 
really n m 
− numbers - the descriptions of the valuation 
functions of all bidders there are two aspects to 
computational efficiency in these settings the first is the 
communication with the bidders i e the number of queries made and 
the second is the usual computational tractability our 
lower bounds will depend only on the number of 
queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions 
like p np our upper bounds will always be 
computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries 
and in terms of regular computation as mentioned this 
paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation 
and on its computational consequences and does not address 
issues of incentives this strengthens our lower bounds but 
means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this 
perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial 
auction 
the second part of this paper studies the power of 
ascending -price auctions ascending auctions are iterative 
auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time in 
this work we try to systematically analyze what do the 
differences between various models of ascending auctions mean 
we try to answer the following questions i which models 
of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation and for 
which classes of valuations ii in cases where the optimal 
allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions how 
well can such auctions approximate the social welfare iii 
how do the different models for ascending auctions compare 
are some models computationally stronger than others 
ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the 
literature see the recent survey by parkes most of this 
work presented upper bounds i e proposed mechanisms 
with ascending prices and analyzed their properties a 
result which is closer in spirit to ours is by gul and stacchetti 
 who showed that no item-price ascending auction can 
always determine the vcg prices even for substitutes 
valuations 
our framework is more general than the traditional 
line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and 
 
we do observe however that some weak incentive 
property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic 
players will answer all demand queries truthfully we also 
note that in some cases but not always the incentives 
issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference 
elicitation issues e g by using vickrey-clarke-groves vcg 
prices e g

payments and in particular on reaching walrasian 
equilibria or competitive equilibria a walrasian equilibrium 
is known to exist in the case of substitutes valuations and 
is known to be impossible for any wider class of valuations 
 this does not rule out other allocations by ascending 
auctions in this paper we view the auctions as a 
computational process where the outcome - both the allocation 
and the payments - can be determined according to all the 
data elicited throughout the auction this general 
framework strengthens our negative results 
we find the study of ascending auctions appealing for 
various reasons first ascending auctions are widely used in 
many real-life settings from the fcc spectrum auctions 
to almost any e-commerce website e g actually 
this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items ask 
the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices 
and increase the prices of over-demanded goods ascending 
auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders 
and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the 
auctioneer as they see the result gradually emerging from 
the bidders responses ascending auctions also have other 
desired economic properties e g they incur smaller 
information revelation consider for example english auctions 
vs second-price sealed bid auctions

figure the best approximation factors currently achievable by computationally-efficient combinatorial auctions 
for several classes of valuations all lower bounds in the table apply to all iterative auctions except the one marked 
by all upper bounds in the table are achieved with item-price demand queries 
rizes the basic classes of auctions implied by combinations 
of the above properties and classifies some of the auctions 
proposed in the literature according to this classification 
for our purposes two families of these auctions serve as 
the main motivating starting points the first is the 
ascending item-price auctions of that with computational 
efficiency find an optimal allocation among gross 
substitutes valuations and the second is the ascending 
bundleprice auctions of that find an optimal allocation 
among general valuations - but not necessarily with 
computational efficiency the main lower bound in this area 
due to states that indeed due to inherent 
communication requirements it is not possible for any iterative auction 
to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with 
sub-exponentially many queries a similar exponential lower 
bound was shown in also for even approximating the 
optimal allocation to within a factor of m − 
 several lower 
bounds and upper bounds for approximation are known for 
some natural classes of valuations - these are summarized 
in figure 
in the universal generality of demand queries is also 
shown any non-deterministic communication protocol for 
finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can 
be converted into one that only uses demand queries with 
bundle prices in this was generalized also to 
nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy 
other natural types of economic requirements e g 
approximate social efficiency envy-freeness however in it was 
demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries 
holds only in the nondeterministic setting while in the usual 
deterministic setting demand queries even with bundle 
prices may be exponentially weaker than general 
communication 
bundle-price auctions are a generalization of the more 
natural and intuitive item-price auctions it is known that 
indeed item-price auctions may be exponentially weaker a 
nice example is the case of valuations that are a xor of k 
bundles 
 where k is small say polynomial lahaie and 
parkes show an economically-efficient bundle-price 
auction that uses a polynomial number of queries whenever k is 
polynomial in contrast show that there exist valuations 
that are xors of k 
√ 
m bundles such that any item-price 
auction that finds an optimal allocation between them 
requires exponentially many queries these results are part 
of a recent line of research that study the 
preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions 
and its relation to the full elicitation problem i e 
learn 
these are valuations where bidders have values for k 
specific packages and the value of each bundle is the maximal 
value of one of these packages that it contains 
ing the exact valuations of the bidders these papers adapt 
methods from machine-learning theory to the 
combinatorialauction setting the preference elicitation problem and the 
full elicitation problem relate to a well studied problem in 
microeconomics known as the integrability problem see e g 
 this problem studies if and when one can derive the 
utility function of a consumer from her demand function 
paper organization due to the relatively large 
number of results we present we start with a survey of our new 
results in section after describing our formal model in 
section we present our results concerning the power of 
demand queries in section then we describe the power of 
item-price ascending auctions section and bundle-price 
ascending auctions section readers who are mainly

auctions can skip section

 a survey of our results 
our systematic analysis is composed of the combination 
of a rather large number of results characterizing the power 
and limitations of various classes of auctions in this section 
we will present an exposition describing our new results we 
first discuss the power of demand-query iterative auctions 
and then we turn our attention to ascending auctions 
figure summarizes some of our main results 
 demand queries 
comparison of query types 
we first ask what other natural types of queries could 
we imagine iterative auctions using here is a list of such 
queries that are either natural have been used in the 
literature or that we found useful 
 value query the auctioneer presents a bundle s the 
bidder reports his value v s for this bundle 
 marginal-value query the auctioneer presents a 
bundle a and an item j the bidder reports how much he 
is willing to pay for j given that he already owns a 
i e v j a v a ∪ j − v a 
 demand query with item prices the auctioneer 
presents a vector of item prices p pm the bidder reports 
his demand under these prices i e some set s that 
maximizes v s −

each class of auctions the table shows whether the optimal allocation can be achieved or else how well can it be 
approximated both upper bounds and lower bounds new results are highlighted 
abbreviations poly polynomial number size aa ascending auctions - means that nothing is currently 
known except trivial solutions 
 indirect-utility query the auctioneer presents a set of 
item prices p pm and the bidder responds with his 
indirect-utility under these prices that is the 
highest utility he can achieve from a bundle under these 
prices maxs⊆m v s − 
p 
i∈s pi 
 relative-demand query the auctioneer presents a set 
of non-zero prices p pm and the bidder reports the 
bundle that maximizes his value per unit of money 
i e some set that maximizes v s p 
i∈s pi 
 
theorem each of these queries can be efficiently i e in 
time polynomial in n m and the number of bits of precision 
t needed to represent a single value vi s simulated by a 
sequence of demand queries with item prices 
in particular this shows that demand queries can elicit all 
information about a valuation by simulating all m 
− value 
queries we also observe that value queries and 
marginalvalue queries can simulate each other in polynomial time 
and that demand queries and indirect-utility queries can also 
simulate each other in polynomial time we prove that 
exponentially many value queries may be needed in order to 
simulate a single demand query it is interesting to note 
that for the restricted class of substitutes valuations 
demand queries may be simulated by polynomial number of 
value queries 
welfare approximation 
the next question that we ask is how well can a 
computationally-efficient auction that uses only demand queries 
approximate the optimal allocation two separate 
obstacles are known in a lower bound of min n m − 
 
for any fixed was shown for the approximation factor 
apply for any fixed tie breaking rule 
 
this is exactly the utility achieved by the bundle which 
would be returned in a demand query with the same prices 
this notion relates to the indirect-utility function studied 
in the microeconomic literature see e g 
 
note that when all the prices are the bidder actually 
reports the bundle with the highest per-item price we found 
this type of query useful for example in the design of the 
approximation algorithm described in figure in section 
 
obtained using any polynomial amount of communication 
a computational bound with the same value applies even for 
the case of single-minded bidders but under the assumption 
of np zpp as noted in the 
computationallyefficient greedy algorithm of can be adapted to become 
a polynomial-time iterative auction that achieves a nearly 
matching approximation factor of min n o 
√ 
m this 
iterative auction may be implemented with bundle-price 
demand queries but as far as we see not as one with item 
prices since in a single bundle-price demand query an 
exponential number of prices can be presented this algorithm 
can have an exponential communication cost in section 
 we describe a different item-price auction that achieves 
the same approximation factor with a polynomial number 
of queries and thus with a polynomial communication 
theorem there exists a computationally-efficient 
iterative auction with item-price demand queries that finds an 
allocation that approximates the optimal welfare between 
arbitrary valuations to within a factor of min n o 
√ 
m 
one may then attempt obtaining such an approximation 
factor using iterative auctions that use only the weaker value 
queries however we show that this is impossible 
theorem any iterative auction that uses a polynomial 
 in n and m number of value queries can not achieve an 
approximation factor that is better than o m 
log m 
 
note however that auctions with only value queries are not 
completely trivial in power the bundling auctions of 
holzman et al can easily be implemented by a polynomial 
number of value queries and can achieve an approximation 
factor of o m√ 
log m 
 by using o log m equi-sized bundles 
we do not know how to close the tiny gap between this 
upper bound and our lower bound 
representing bundle-prices 
we then deal with a critical issue with bundle-price 
auctions that was side-stepped by our model as well as by all 
previous works that used bundle-price auctions how are 
 
this was also proven independently by shahar dobzinski 
and michael schapira 
 
the bundle prices represented for item-price auctions this 
is not an issue since a query needs only to specify a small 
number m of prices in bundle-price auctions that 
situation is more difficult since there are exponentially many 
bundles that require pricing our basic model like all 
previous work that used bundle prices e g ignores 
this issue and only requires that the prices be determined 
somehow by the protocol a finer model would fix a 
specific language for denoting bundle prices force the protocol 
to represent the bundle-prices in this language and require 
that the representations of the bundle-prices also be 
polynomial 
what could such a language for denoting prices for all 
bundles look like first note that specifying a price for 
each bundle is equivalent to specifying a valuation second 
as noted in most of the proposed bidding languages 
are really just languages for representing valuations i e a 
syntactic representation of valuations - thus we could use 
any of them this point of view opens up the general issue 
of which language should be used in bundle-price auctions 
and what are the implications of this choice 
here we initiate this line of investigation we consider 
bundle-price auctions where the prices must be given as a 
xor-bid i e the protocol must explicitly indicate the price 
of every bundle whose value is different than that of all of 
its proper subsets note that all bundle-price auctions that 
do not explicitly specify a bidding language must implicitly 
use this language or a weaker one since without a specific 
language one would need to list prices for all bundles 
perhaps except for trivial ones those with value or more 
generally those with a value that is determined by one of 
their proper subsets we show that once the 
representation length of bundle prices is taken into account using the 
xor-language bundle-price auctions are no more strictly 
stronger than item-price auctions define the cost of an 
iterative auction as the total length of the queries and answers 
used throughout the auction in the worst case 
theorem for some class of valuations bundle price 
auctions that use the xor-language require an exponential cost 
for finding the optimal allocation in contrast item-price 
auctions can find the optimal allocation for this class within 
polynomial cost 
this put doubts on the applicability of bundle-price 
auctions like and it may justify the use of hybrid 
pricing methods such as ausubel cramton and milgrom s 
clock-proxy auction 
demand queries and linear programs 
the winner determination problem in combinatorial 
auctions may be formulated as an integer program in many 
cases solving the linear-program relaxation of this integer 
program is useful for some restricted classes of valuations 
it finds the optimum of the integer program e g substitute 
valuations or helps approximating the optimum 
 e g by randomized rounding however the linear 
program has an exponential number of variables nisan and 
segal observed the surprising fact that despite the 
ex 
our proof relies on the sophisticated known lower bounds 
for constant depth circuits we were not able to find an 
elementary proof 
ponential number of variables this linear program may be 
solved within polynomial communication the basic idea is 
to solve the dual program using the ellipsoid method see 
e g the dual program has a polynomial number of 
variables but an exponential number of constraints the 
ellipsoid algorithm runs in polynomial time even on such 
programs provided that a separation oracle is given for 
the set of constraints surprisingly such a separation oracle 
can be implemented using a single demand query with item 
prices to each of the bidders 
the treatment of was somewhat ad-hoc to the 
problem at hand the case of substitute valuations here we 
give a somewhat more general form of this important 
observation let us call the following class of linear programs 
generalized-winner-determination-relaxation gwdr 
lps 
maximize 
x 
i∈n s⊆m 
wi xi s vi s 
s t 
x 
i∈n s j∈s 
xi s ≤ qj ∀j ∈ m 
x 
s⊆m 
xi s ≤ di ∀i ∈ n 
xi s ≥ ∀i ∈ n s ⊆ m 
the case where wi di qj for every i j 
is the usual linear relaxation of the winner determination 
problem more generally wi may be viewed as the weight 
given to bidder i s welfare qj may be viewed as the quantity 
of units of good j and di may be viewed as duplicity of the 
number of bidders of type i 
theorem any gwdr linear program may be solved in 
polynomial time in n m and the number of bits of precision 
t using only demand queries with item prices 
 ascending auctions 
ascending item-price auctions 
it is well known that the item-price ascending auctions 
of kelso and crawford and its variants find 
the optimal allocation as long as all players valuations have 
the substitutes property the obvious question is whether 
the optimal allocation can be found for a larger class of 
valuations 
our main result here is a strong negative result 
theorem there is a -item -player problem where no 
ascending item-price auction can find the optimal allocation 
this is in contrast to both the power of bundle-price 
ascending auctions and to the power of general item-price 
demand queries see above both of which can always find the 
optimal allocation and in fact even provide full preference 
elicitation the same proof proves a similar impossibility 
result for other types of auctions e g descending auctions 
non-anonymous auctions more extension of this result 
 eliciting some classes of valuations requires an 
exponential number of ascending item-price trajectories 
 
the produced optimal solution will have polynomial 
support and thus can be listed fully 
 
 at least k − ascending item-price trajectories are 
needed to elicit xor formulae with k terms this 
result is in some sense tight since we show that any 
k-term xor formula can be fully elicited by k− 
nondeterministic i e when some exogenous teacher 
instructs the auctioneer on how to increase the prices 
ascending auctions 
we also show that item-price ascending auctions and 
iterative auctions that are limited to a polynomial number 
of queries of any kind not necessarily ascending are 
incomparable in their power ascending auctions with small 
enough increments can elicit the preferences in cases where 
any polynomial number of queries cannot 
motivated by several recent papers that studied the 
relation between eliciting and fully-eliciting the preferences in 
combinatorial auctions e g we explore the 
difference between these problems in the context of ascending 
auctions we show that although a single ascending auction can 
determine the optimal allocation among any number of 
bidders with substitutes valuations it cannot fully-elicit such a 
valuation even for a single bidder while it was shown in 
that the set of substitutes valuations has measure zero in the 
space of general valuations its dimension is not known and 
in particular it is still open whether a polynomial amount 
of information suffices to describe a substitutes valuation 
while our result may be a small step in that direction a 
polynomial full elicitation may still be possible with other 
communication protocols we note that our impossibility 
result also holds for valuations in the class oxs defined by 
 valuations that we are able to show have a compact 
representation 
we also give several results separating the power of 
different models for ascending combinatorial auctions that use 
item-prices we prove not surprisingly that adaptive 
ascending auctions are more powerful than oblivious 
ascending auctions and that non-deterministic ascending auctions 
are more powerful than deterministic ascending auctions 
we also compare different kinds of non-anonymous auctions 
 e g simultaneous or sequential and observe that 
anonymous bundle-price auctions and non-anonymous item-price 
auctions are incomparable in their power finally 
motivated by dutch auctions we consider descending auctions 
and how they compare to ascending ones we show classes of 
valuations that can be elicited by ascending item-price 
auctions but not by descending item-price auctions and vice 
versa 
ascending bundle-price auctions 
all known ascending bundle-price auctions that are able 
to find the optimal allocation between general valuations 
 with free disposal use non-anonymous prices 
anonymous ascending-price auctions e g are only 
known to be able to find the optimal allocation among 
superadditive valuations or few other simple classes we 
show that this is no mistake 
theorem no ascending auction with anonymous prices 
can find the optimal allocation between general valuations 
 
non-deterministic computation is widely used in cs and 
also in economics e g a walrasian equilibrium or in 
some settings deterministic and non-deterministic models 
have equal power e g computation with finite automata 
this bound is regardless of the running time and it also 
holds for descending auctions and non-deterministic 
auctions 
we strengthen this result significantly by showing that 
anonymous ascending auctions cannot produce a better than 
o 
√ 
m approximation - the approximation ratio that can 
be achieved with a polynomial number of queries 
and as mentioned with a polynomial number of item-price 
demand queries the same lower bound clearly holds for 
anonymous item-price ascending auctions since such 
auctions can be simulated by anonymous bundle-price 
ascending auctions we currently do not have any lower bound on 
the approximation achievable by non-anonymous item-price 
ascending auctions 
finally we study the performance of the existing 
computationally-efficient ascending auctions these protocols 
 require exponential time in the worst case and this is 
unavoidable as shown by however we also observe that 
these auctions as well as the whole class of similar 
ascending bundle-price auctions require an exponential time even 
for simple additive valuations this is avoidable and indeed 
the ascending item-price auctions of can find the 
optimal allocation for these simple valuations with polynomial 
communication 
 the model 
 discrete auctions for continuous values 
our model aims to capture iterative auctions that operate 
on real-valued valuations there is a slight technical 
difficulty here in bridging the gap between the discrete nature 
of an iterative auction and the continuous nature of the 
valuations this is exactly the same problem as in modeling 
a simple english auction there are three standard formal 
ways to model it 
 model the auction as a continuous process and study 
its trajectory in time for example the so-called japanese 
auction is basically a continuous model of an english 
model 
 model the auction as discrete and the valuations as 
continuously valued in this case we introduce a 
parameter and usually require the auction to produce 
results that are -close to optimal 
 model the valuations as discrete in this case we will 
assume that all valuations are integer multiples of some 
small fixed quantity δ e g penny all 
communication in this case is then naturally finite 
in this paper we use the latter formulation and assume 
that all values are multiples of some δ thus in some parts 
of the paper we assume without loss of generality that δ 
hence all valuations are integral almost all if not all of 
our results can be translated to the other two models with 
little effort 
 valuations 
a single auctioneer is selling m indivisible 
non-homogeneous items in a single auction and let m be the set of these 
 
another similar model is the moving knives model in the 
cake-cutting literature 
 
items and n be the set of bidders each one of the n 
bidders in the auction has a valuation function vi m 
→ 
 δ δ l where for every bundle of items s ⊆ m 
vi s denotes the value of bidder i for the bundle s and is 
a multiple of δ in the range l we will sometimes 
denote the number of bits needed to represent such values in 
the range l by t log l we assume free disposal i e 
s ⊆ t implies vi s ≤ vi t and that vi ∅ for all 
bidders 
we will mention the following classes of valuations 
 a valuation is called sub-modular if for all sets of items 
a and b we have that v a ∪ b v a ∩ b ≤ v a 
v b 
 a valuation is called super-additive if for all disjoint 
sets of items a and b we have that v a∪b ≥ v a 
v b 
 a valuation is called a k-bundle xor if it can be 
represented as a xor combination of at most k atomic 
bids i e if there are at most k bundles si and 
prices pi such that for all s v s maxi s⊇si 
pi such 
valuations will be denoted by v s p ⊕ s 
p ⊕ ⊕ sk pk 
 iterative auctions 
the auctioneer sets up a protocol equivalently an 
algorithm where at each stage of the protocol some 
information q - termed the query - is sent to some bidder i 
and then bidder i replies with some reply that depends on 
the query as well as on his own valuation in this paper 
we assume that we have complete control over the bidders 
behavior and thus the protocol also defines a reply function 
ri q vi that specifies bidder i s reply to query q the 
protocol may be adaptive the query value as well as the queried 
bidder may depend on the replies received for past queries 
at the end of the protocol an allocation s sn must be 
declared where si ∩ sj ∅ for i j 
we say that the auction finds an optimal allocation if 
it finds the allocation that maximizes the social welfarep 
i vi si we say that it finds a c-approximation if 
p 
i vi si 
≥ 
p 
i vi ti c where t tn is an optimal allocation the 
running time of the auction on a given instance of the 
bidders valuations is the total number of queries made on this 
instance the running time of a protocol is the worst case 
cost over all instances note that we impose no 
computational limitations on the protocol or on the players 
this 
of course only strengthens our hardness results yet our 
positive results will not use this power and will be efficient 
also in the usual computational sense 
our goal will be to design computationally-efficient 
protocols we will deem a protocol computationally-efficient if 
its cost is polynomial in the relevant parameters the 
number of bidders n the number of items m and t log l 
where l is the largest possible value of a bundle however 
when we discuss ascending-price auctions and their variants 
a computationally-efficient protocol will be required to be 
 
for example v abcd ⊕ ab ⊕ c denotes the 
xor valuation with the terms abcd ab c and prices 
respectively for this valuation v abcd v abd 
v abc 
 
the running time really measures communication costs and 
not computational running time 
pseudo-polynomial i e it should ask a number of queries 
which is polynomial in m n and l 
δ 
 this is because that 
ascending auctions can usually not achieve such running times 
 consider even the english auction on a single item 
note 
that all of our results give concrete bounds where the 
dependence on the parameters is given explicitly we use the 
standard big-oh notation just as a shorthand 
we say than an auction elicits some class v of valuations 
if it determines the optimal allocation for any profile of 
valuations drawn from v we say that an auction fully elicits 
some class of valuations v if it can fully learn any single 
valuation v ∈ v i e learn v s for every s 
 demand queries and ascending auctions 
most of the paper will be concerned with a common 
special case of iterative auctions that we term demand 
auctions in such auctions the queries that are sent to bidders 
are demand queries the query specifies a price p s ∈ 
for each bundle s the reply of bidder i is simply the set 
most desired - demanded - under these prices formally 
a set s that maximizes vi s − p s it may happen that 
more than one set s maximizes this value in which case 
ties are broken according to some fixed tie-breaking rule 
e g the lexicographically first such set is returned all of 
our results hold for any fixed tie-breaking rule 
ascending auctions are iterative auctions with 
non-decreasing prices 
definition in an ascending auction the prices in the 
queries to the same bidder can only increase in time 
formally let p be a query made for bidder i and q be a query 
made for bidder i at a later stage in the protocol then for 
all sets s q s ≥ p s a similar variant which we also 
study and that is also common in real life is descending 
auctions in which prices can only decrease in time 
note that the term ascending auction refers to an 
auction with a single ascending trajectory of prices it may 
be useful to define multi-trajectory ascending auctions in 
which the prices maybe reset to zero a number of times see 
e g 
we consider two main restrictions on the types of allowed 
demand queries 
definition item prices the prices in each query 
are given by prices pj for each item j the price of a set s 
is additive p s 
p 
j∈s pj 
definition anonymous prices the prices seen by 
the bidders at any stage in the auction are the same i e 
whenever a query is made to some bidder the same query is 
also made to all other bidders with the prices unchanged 
in auctions with non-anonymous discriminatory prices 
each bidder i has personalized prices denoted by pi 
 s 
in this paper all auctions are anonymous unless otherwise 
specified 
note that even though in our model valuations are integral 
 or multiples of some δ we allow the demand query to 
 
most of the auctions we present may be adapted to run in 
time polynomial in log l using a binary-search-like 
procedure losing their ascending nature 
 
note that a non-anonymous auction can clearly be 
simulated by n parallel anonymous auctions 
 
use arbitrary real numbers in that is we assume that 
the increment we use in the ascending auctions may be 
significantly smaller than δ all our hardness results hold 
for any even for continuous price increments a practical 
issue here is how will the query be specified in the general 
case an exponential number of prices needs to be sent in a 
single query formally this is not a problem as the model 
does not limit the length of queries in any way - the protocol 
must simply define what the prices are in terms of the replies 
received for previous queries we look into this issue further 
in section 
 the power of demand queries 
in this section we study the power of iterative auctions 
that use demand queries not necessarily ascending we 
start by comapring demand queries to other types of queries 
then we discuss how well can one approximate the optimal 
welfare using a polynomial number of demand queries we 
also initiate the study of the representation of bundle-price 
demand queries and finally we show how demand queries 
help solving the linear-programming relaxation of 
combinatorial auctions in polynomial time 
 the power of different types of queries 
in this section we compare the power of the various types 
of queries defined in section we will present 
computationally -efficient simulations of these query types using 
item-price demand queries in section we show that 
these simulations can also be done using item-price 
ascending auctions 
lemma a value query can be simulated by m 
marginalvalue queries a marginal-value query can be simulated by 
two value queries 
lemma a value query can be simulated by mt 
demand queries where t log l is the number of bits needed 
to represent a single bundle value 
as a direct corollary we get that demand auctions can 
always fully elicit the bidders valuations by simulating all 
possible m 
− queries and thus elicit enough information 
for determining the optimal allocation note however that 
this elicitation may be computationally inefficient 
the next lemma shows that demand queries can be 
exponentially more powerful than value queries 
lemma an exponential number of value queries may 
be required for simulating a single demand query 
indirect utility queries are however equivalent in power 
to demand queries 
lemma an indirect-utility query can be simulated by 
mt demand queries a demand query can be simulated 
by m indirect-utility queries 
demand queries can also simulate relative-demand queries 
 
note that t bundle-price demand queries can easily 
simulate a value query by setting the prices of all the bundles 
except s the bundle with the unknown value to be l and 
performing a binary search on the price of s 
 
note although in our model values are integral our

summarizes the relations between these query types 
 approximating the social welfare with 
value and demand queries 
we know from that iterative combinatorial auctions 
that only use a polynomial number of queries can not find 
an optimal allocation among general valuations and in fact 
can not even approximate it to within a factor better than 
min n m − 
 in this section we ask how well can this 
approximation be done using demand queries with item prices 
or using the weaker value queries we show that using 
demand queries the lower bound can be matched while value 
queries can only do much worse 
figure describes a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves 
a min n o 
√ 
m approximation ratio this algorithm 
greedily picks the bundles that maximize the bidders per-item 
value using relative-demand queries see section as 
a final step it allocates all the items to a single bidder if 
it improves the social welfare this can be checked using 
value queries since both value queries and relative-demand 
queries can be simulated by a polynomial number of 
demand queries with item prices lemmas and this 
algorithm can be implemented by a polynomial number of 
demand queries with item prices 
theorem the auction described in figure can be 
implemented by a polynomial number of demand queries and 
achieves a min n 
√ 
m -approximation for the social 
welfare 
we now ask how well can the optimal welfare be 
approximated by a polynomial number of value queries first we 
note that value queries are not completely powerless in 
 it is shown that if the m items are split into k fixed 
bundles of size m k each and these fixed bundles are 
auctioned as though each was indivisible then the social welfare 
bers thus we may have bundles with arbitrarily close 
relative demands in this sense the simulation above is only up 
to any given and the number of queries is o log l log 
 
when the relative-demand query prices are given as rational 
numbers exact simulation is implied when log is linear in 
the input length 
 
in the full paper we observe that this algorithm can be 
implemented by two descending item-price auctions where 
we allow removing items along the auction 
 
generated by such an auction is at least m√ 
k 
-approximation 
of that possible in the original auction notice that such 
an auction can be implemented by k 
− value queries to 
each bidder - querying the value of each bundle of the fixed 
bundles thus if we choose k log m bundles we get an 
m√ 
log m 
-approximation while still using a polynomial number 
of queries 
the following lemma shows that not much more is possible 
using value queries 
lemma any iterative auction that uses only value 
queries and distinguishes between k-tuples of valuations 
where the optimal allocation has value and those where the 
optimal allocation has value k requires at least 
m 
k queries 
proof consider the following family of valuations for 
every s such that s m v s and there exists a 
single set t such that for s ≤ m v s iff t ⊆ s 
and v s otherwise now look at the behavior of the 
protocol when all valuations vi have t m clearly 
in this case the value of the best allocation is since no set 
of size m 
 
or lower has non-zero value for any player fix the 
sequence of queries and answers received on this k-tuple of 
valuations 
now consider the k-tuple of valuations chosen at random 
as follows a partition of the m items into k sets t tk 
each of size m 
k 
each is chosen uniformly at random among 
all such partitions now consider the k-tuple of valuations 
from our family that correspond to this partition - clearly 
ti can be allocated to i for each i getting a total value of k 
now look at the protocol when running on these valuations 
and compare its behavior to the original case note that the 
answer to a query s to player i differs between the case of 
ti and the original case of t m only if s ≤ m 
 
and 
ti ⊆ s since ti is distributed uniformly among all sets of 
size exactly m 
k 
 we have that for any fixed query s to player 
i where s ≤ m 
 
 
pr ti ⊆ s ≤ 
„ 
 s 
m 
 ti 
≤ − m 
k 
using the union-bound if the original sequence of queries 
was of length less than 
m 
k then with positive probability 
none of the queries in the sequence would receive a different 
answer than for the original input tuple this is forbidden 
since the protocol must distinguish between this case and 
the original case - which cannot happen if all queries receive 
the same answer hence there must have been at least 
m 
k 
queries for the original tuple of valuations 
we conclude that a polynomial time protocol that uses 
only value queries cannot obtain a better than o m 
log m 
 
approximation of the welfare 
theorem an iterative auction that uses a 
polynomial number of value queries cannot achieve better than 
o m

approximation ratio k which is asymptotically greater than 
m

let k ← n be the currently participating bidders

grand bundle if allocating all the items to some bidder i 
improves the social welfare achieved so far

then allocate all items to this bidder i 
figure this algorithm achieves a min n 
√ 
 
m approximation for the social welfare which is 
asymptotically the best worst-case approximation possible with 
polynomial communication this algorithm can be 
implemented with a polynomial number of demand queries 
 the representation of bundle prices 
in this section we explicitly fix the language in which 
bundle prices are presented to the bidders in bundle-price 
auctions this language requires the algorithm to explicitly list 
the price of every bundle with a non-trivial price 
trivial in this context is a price that is equal to that of one of 
its proper subsets which was listed explicitly this 
representation is equivalent to the xor-language for expressing 
valuations formally each query q is given by an 
expression q s p ⊕ s p ⊕ ⊕ sl pl in this 
representation the price demanded for every set s is simply 
p s max k l sk⊆s pk 
definition the length of the query q s p ⊕ 
 s p ⊕ ⊕ sl pl is l the cost of an algorithm is the 
sum of the lengths of the queries asked during the operation 
of the algorithm on the worst case input 
note that under this definition bundle-price auctions are 
not necessarily stronger than item-price auctions an 
itemprice query that prices each item for is translated to an 
exponentially long bundle-price query that needs to specify 
the price s for each bundle s but perhaps bundle-price 
auctions can still find optimal allocations whenever 
itemprice auction can without directly simulating such queries 
we show that this is not the case indeed when the 
representation length is taken into account bundle price auctions 
are sometimes seriously inferior to item price auctions 
consider the following family of valuations each item is 
valued at except that for some single set s its value is a 
bit more s b where b ∈ note that an item 
price auction can easily find the optimal allocation between 
any two such valuations set the prices of each item to 
if the demand sets of the two players are both empty then 
b for both valuations and an arbitrary allocation is fine 
if one of them is empty and the other non-empty allocate 
the non-empty demand set to its bidder and the rest to the 
other if both demand sets are non-empty then unless they 
form an exact partition we need to see which b is larger 
which we can do by increasing the price of a single item in 
each demand set 
 
we will show that any bundle-price auction that uses only 
the xor-language to describe bundle prices requires an 
exponential cost which includes the sum of all description 
lengths of prices to find an optimal allocation between any 
two such valuations 
lemma every bundle-price auction that uses 
xorexpressions to denote bundle prices requires ω 
√ 
m 
cost in 
order to find the optimal allocation among two valuations 
from the above family 
the complication in the proof stems from the fact that 
using xor-expressions the length of the price description 
depends on the number of bundles whose price is strictly 
larger than each of their subsets - this may be significantly 
smaller than the number of bundles that have a non-zero 
price the proof becomes easy if we require the protocol 
to explicitly name every bundle with non-zero price we 
do not know of any elementary proof for this lemma 
 although we believe that one can be found instead we 
reduce the problem to a well known lower bound in boolean 
circuit complexity stating that boolean circuits of depth 
 that compute the majority function on m variables require 
 ω

 demand queries and linear programming 
consider the following linear-programming relaxation for 
the generalized winner-determination problem in 
combinatorial auctions the primal program 
maximize 
x 
i∈n s⊆m 
wi xi s vi s 
s t 
x 
i∈n s j∈s 
xi s ≤ qj ∀j ∈ m 
x 
s⊆m 
xi s ≤ di ∀i ∈ n 
xi s ≥ ∀i ∈ n s ⊆ m 
note that the primal program has an exponential number 
of variables yet we will be able to solve it in polynomial 
time using demand queries to the bidders the solution will 
have a polynomial size support non-zero values for xi s 
and thus we will be able to describe it in polynomial time 
here is its dual

j∈s 
pj ≥ wivi s ∀i ∈ n s ⊆ m 
pi ≥ uj ≥ ∀i ∈ m j ∈ n 
notice that the dual problem has exactly n m variables 
but an exponential number of constraints thus the dual 
can be solved using the ellipsoid method in polynomial time 
- if a separation oracle can be implemented in polynomial 
time recall that a separation oracle when given a possible 
solution either confirms that it is a feasible solution or 
responds with a constraint that is violated by the possible 
solution 
we construct a separation oracle for solving the dual 
program using a single demand query to each of the bidders 
consider a possible solution u p for the dual program we 
can re-write the constraints of the dual program as 
ui wi ≥ vi s − 
x 
j∈s 
pj wi 
now a demand query to bidder i with prices pj wi reveals 
exactly the set s that maximizes the rhs of the previous 
inequality thus in order to check whether u p is 
feasible it suffices to query each bidder i for his demand 
di under the prices pj wi check only the n constraints 
ui 
p 
j∈di 
pj ≥ wivi di where vi di can be simulated 
using a polynomial sequence of demand queries as shown in 
lemma if none of these is violated then we are assured 
that u p is feasible otherwise we get a violated constraint 
what is left to be shown is how the primal program can 
be solved recall that the primal program has an 
exponential number of variables since the ellipsoid algorithm 
runs in polynomial time it encounters only a polynomial 
number of constraints during its operation clearly if all 
other constraints were removed from the dual program it 
would still have the same solution adding constraints can 
only decrease the space of feasible solutions now take the 
reduced dual where only the constraints encountered 
exist and look at its dual it will have the same solution as the 
original dual and hence of the original primal however look 
at the form of this dual of the reduced dual it is just a 
version of the primal program with a polynomial number of 
variables - those corresponding to constraints that remained 
in the reduced dual thus it can be solved in polynomial 
time and this solution clearly solves the original primal 
program setting all other variables to zero 
 item-price ascending auctions 
in this section we characterize the power of ascending 
item-price auctions we first show that this power is not 
trivial such auctions can in general elicit an exponential 
amount of information on the other hand we show that 
the optimal allocation cannot always be determined by a 
single ascending auction and in some cases nor by an 
exponential number of ascending-price trajectories finally 
we separate the power of different models of ascending 
auctions 
 the power of item-price ascending 
auctions 
we first show that if small enough increments are allowed 
a single ascending trajectory of item-prices can elicit 
preferences that cannot be elicited with polynomial 
communication as mentioned all our hardness results hold for any 
increment even infinitesimal 
theorem some classes of valuations can be elicited 
by item-price ascending auctions but cannot be elicited by a 
polynomial number of queries of any kind 
proof sketch consider two bidders with v s if 
 s n 
 
 v s if s n 
 
and every s such that s n 
 
has an unknown value from due to determining 
the optimal allocation here requires exponential 
communication in the worst case nevertheless we show see that 
an item-price ascending auction can do it as long as it can 
use exponentially small increments 
we now describe another positive result for the power of 
item-price ascending auctions in section we showed 
 
v ab v a v b 
bidder α ∈ β ∈ 
bidder 
figure no item-price ascending auctions can 
determine the optimal allocation for this class of valuations 
that a value query can be simulated with a truly 
polynomial number of item-price demand queries here we show 
that every value query can be simulated by a pseudo 
polynomial number of ascending item-price demand queries in 
the next subsection we show that we cannot always 
simulate even a pair of value queries using a single item-price 
ascending auction in the full paper part ii we show 
that we can simulate other types of queries using item-price 
ascending auctions 
proposition a value query can be simulated by an 
item-price ascending auction this simulation requires a 
polynomial number of queries 
actually the proof for proposition proves a stronger 
useful result regarding the information elicited by iterative 
auctions it says that in any iterative auction in which the 
changes of prices are small enough in each stage 
 pseudocontinuous auctions the value of all bundles demanded 
during the auction can be computed the basic idea is that 
when the bidder moves from demanding some bundle ti to 
demanding another bundle ti there is a point in which she 
is indifferent between these two bundles thus knowing the 
value of some demanded bundle e g the empty set enables 
computing the values of all other demanded bundles 
we say that an auction is pseudo-continuous if it only 
uses demand queries and in each step the price of at most 
one item is changed by for some ∈ δ with respect 
to the previous query 
proposition consider any pseudo-continuous 
auction not necessarily ascending in which bidder i demands 
the empty set at least once along the auction then the 
value of every bundle demanded by bidder i throughout the 
auction can be calculated at the end of the auction 
 limitations of item-price ascending 
auctions 
although we observed that demand queries can solve any 
combinatorial auction problem when the queries are 
restricted to be ascending some classes of valuations cannot 
be elicited nor fully-elicited an example for such class of 
valuations is given in figure 
theorem there are classes of valuations that 
cannot be elicited nor fully elicited by any item-price ascending 
auction 
proof let bidder have the valuation described in the 
first row of figure where α and β are unknown values in 
 first we prove that this class cannot be fully elicited 
by a single ascending auction specifically an ascending 
auction cannot reveal the values of both α and β 
as long as pa and pb are both below the bidder will 
always demand the whole bundle ab her utility from ab is 
strictly greater than the utility from either a or b separately 
for example we show that u ab u a 
u ab − pa pb − pa − pb 
 va a − pa − pb u a 
thus in order to gain any information about α or β the 
price of one of the items should become at least w l o g 
pa ≥ but then the bundle a will not be demanded by 
bidder throughout the auction thus no information at all 
will be gained about α 
now assume that bidder is known to have the valuation 
described in the second row of figure the optimal 
allocation depends on whether α is greater than β in bidder s 
valuation and we proved that an ascending auction cannot 
determine this 
the proof of the theorem above shows that for an 
unknown value to be revealed the price of one item should be 
greater than and the other price should be smaller than 
 therefore in a price-monotonic trajectory of prices only 
one of these values can be revealed an immediate 
conclusion is that this impossibility result also holds for item-price 
descending auctions since no such trajectory exists then 
the same conclusion even holds for non-deterministic 
itemprice auctions in which exogenous data tells us how to 
increase the prices also note that since the hardness stems 
from the impossibility to fully-elicit a valuation of a single 
bidder this result also holds for non-anonymous ascending 
item-price auctions 
 limitations of multi-trajectory 
ascending auctions 
according to theorem no ascending item-price 
auction can always elicit the preferences we prove a similar 
result for bundle prices in section but can two 
ascending trajectories do the job or a polynomial number of 
ascending trajectories we give negative answers for such 
suggestions 
we define a k-trajectory ascending auction as a 
demandquery iterative auction in which the demand queries can be 
partitioned to k sets of queries where the prices published 
in each set only increase in time note that we use a general 
definition it allows the trajectories to run in parallel or 
sequentially and to use information elicited in some 
trajectories for determining the future queries in other trajectories 
the power of multiple-trajectory auctions can be 
demonstrated by the negative result of gul and stacchetti who 
showed that even for an auction among substitutes 
valuations an anonymous ascending item-price auction cannot 
compute vcg prices for all players 
ausubel overcame 
this impossibility result and designed auctions that do 
compute vcg prices by organizing the auction as a sequence of 
n ascending auctions here we prove that one cannot 
elicit xor valuations with k terms by less than k − 
ascending trajectories on the other hand we show that an 
xor formula can be fully elicited by k− non-deterministic 
ascending auctions or by k− deterministic ascending 
auctions if the auctioneer knows the atomic bundles 
 
a recent unpublished paper by mishra and parkes 
extends this result and shows that non-anonymous prices with 
bundle-prices are necessary in order that an ascending 
auction will end up with a universal-competitive-equilibrium 
 that leads to vcg payments 
 
this result actually separates the power of deterministic 
 
proposition xor valuations with k terms cannot 
be elicited or fully elicited by any k- -trajectory 
itemprice ascending auction even when the atomic bundles are 
known to the elicitor however these valuations can be 
elicited and fully elicited by k- -trajectory 
non-deterministic non-anonymous item-price ascending auctions 
moreover an exponential number of trajectories is 
required for eliciting some classes of valuations 
proposition elicitation and full-elicitation of some 
classes of valuations cannot be done by any k-trajectory 
itemprice ascending auction where k o m 
 
proof sketch consider the following class of 
valuations for s m 
 
 v s and for s m 
 
 v s 
every bundle s of size m 
 
has some unknown value in 
we show that a single item-price ascending auction 
can reveal the value of at most one bundle of size n 
 
 and 
therefore an exponential number of ascending trajectories is 
needed in order to elicit such valuations 
we observe that the algorithm we presented in section 
 can be implemented by a polynomial number of 
ascending auctions each item-price demand query can be 
considered as a separate ascending auction and therefore a 
min n 
√ 
m -approximation can be achieved by a 
polynomial number of ascending auctions we do not currently 
have a better upper bound or any lower bound 
 separating the various models of 
ascending auctions 
various models for ascending auctions have been suggested 
in the literature in this section we compare the power of 
the different models as mentioned all auctions are 
considered anonymous and deterministic unless specified 
otherwise 
ascending vs descending auctions we begin the 
discussion of the relation between ascending auctions and 
descending auctions with an example the algorithm by 
lehmann lehmann and nisan can be implemented by 
a simple item-price descending auction see the full paper for 
details this algorithm guarantees at least half of the 
optimal efficiency for submodular valuations however we are 
not familiar with any ascending auction that guarantees a 
similar fraction of the efficiency this raises a more general 
question can ascending auctions solve any 
combinatorialauction problem that is solvable using a descending auction 
 and vice versa we give negative answers to these 
questions the idea behind the proofs is that the information 
that the auctioneer can get for free at the beginning of 
each type of auction is different 
and non-deterministic iterative auctions our proof shows 
that a non-deterministic iterative auction can elicit the 
kterm xor valuations with a polynomial number of demand 
queries and show that this elicitation must take an 
exponential number of demand queries 
 
in ascending auctions the auctioneer can reveal the most 
valuable bundle besides m before she starts raising the 
prices thus she can use this information for adaptively 
choose the subsequent queries in descending auctions one 
can easily find the bundle with the highest average per-item 
price keeping all other bundles with non-positive utilities 
and use this information in the adaptive price change 
proposition there are classes that cannot be 
elicited fully elicited by ascending item-price auctions but can 
be elicited resp fully elicited with a descending item-price 
auction 
proposition there are classes that cannot be 
elicited fully elicited by item-price descending auctions but can 
be elicited resp fully elicited by item-price ascending 
auctions 
deterministic vs non-deterministic auctions 
nondeterministic ascending auctions can be viewed as auctions 
where some benevolent teacher that has complete 
information guides the auctioneer on how she should raise the prices 
that is preference elicitation can be done by a 
non-deterministic ascending auction if there is some ascending trajectory 
that elicits enough information for determining the optimal 
allocation and verifying that it is indeed optimal we show 
that non-deterministic ascending auctions are more powerful 
than deterministic ascending auctions 
proposition some classes can be elicited fully 
elicited by an item-price non-deterministic ascending 
auction but cannot be elicited resp fully elicited by item-price 
deterministic ascending auctions 
anonymous vs non-anonymous auctions as will 
be shown in section the power of anonymous and 
nonanonymous bundle-price ascending auctions differs 
significantly here we show that a difference also exists for 
itemprice ascending auctions 
proposition some classes cannot be elicited by 
anonymous item-price ascending auctions but can be elicited 
by a non-anonymous item-price ascending auction 
sequential vs simultaneous auctions a 
non-anonymous auction is called simultaneous if at each stage the price 
of some item is raised by for every bidder the auctioneer 
can use the information gathered until each stage in all the 
personalized trajectories to determine the next queries 
a non-anonymous auction is called sequential if the 
auctioneer performs an auction for each bidder separately in 
sequential order the auctioneer can determine the next 
query based on the information gathered in the trajectories 
completed so far and on the history of the current trajectory 
proposition there are classes that cannot be 
elicited by simultaneous non-anonymous item-price ascending 
auctions but can be elicited by a sequential non-anonymous 
item-price ascending auction 
adaptive vs oblivious auctions if the auctioneer 
determines the queries regardless of the bidders responses i e 
the queries are predefined we say that the auction is 
oblivious otherwise the auction is adaptive we prove that an 
adaptive behaviour of the auctioneer may be beneficial 
proposition there are classes that cannot be 
elicited fully elicited using oblivious item-price ascending 
auctions but can be elicited resp fully elicited by an adaptive 
item-price ascending auction 
 
 preference elicitation vs full elicitation 
preference elicitation and full elicitation are closely 
related problems if full elicitation is easy e g in 
polynomial time then clearly elicitation is also easy by a 
nonanonymous auction simply by learning all the valuations 
separately 
 on the other hand there are examples where 
preference elicitation is considered easy but learning is 
hard typically elicitation requires smaller amount of 
information some examples can be found in 
the tatonnement algorithms by end up with 
the optimal allocation for substitutes valuations 
we prove 
that we cannot fully elicit substitutes valuations or even 
their sub-class of oxs valuations defined in even for a 
single bidder by an item-price ascending auction although 
the optimal allocation can be found by an ascending auction 
for any number of bidders 
theorem substitute valuations cannot be fully 
elicited by ascending item-price auctions moreover they 
cannot be fully elicited by any m 
 
ascending trajectories m 
whether substitutes valuations have a compact 
representation i e polynomial in the number of goods is an 
important open question as a step in this direction we show 
that its sub-class of oxs valuations does have a compact 
representation every oxs valuation can be represented by 
at most m 
values 
lemma any oxs valuation can be represented by 
no more than m 
values 
 bundle-price ascending 
auctions 
all the ascending auctions in the literature that are proved 
to find the optimal allocation for unrestricted valuations are 
non-anonymous bundle-price auctions ibundle by parkes 
and ungar and the proxy auction by ausubel and 
milgrom yet several anonymous ascending auctions 
have been suggested e g akba and ibundle 
 in this section we prove that anonymous bundle-price 
ascending auctions achieve poor results in the worst-case 
we also show that the family of non-anonymous 
bundleprice ascending auctions can run exponentially slower than 
simple item-price ascending auctions 
 limitations of anonymous bundle-price 
ascending auctions 
we present a class of valuations that cannot be elicited 
by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions these 
valuations are described in figure the basic idea for 
determining some unknown value of one bidder we must raise 
 
note that an anonymous ascending auction cannot 
necessarily elicit a class that can be fully elicited by an ascending 
auction 
 
substitute valuations are defined e g in roughly 
speaking a bidder with a substitute valuation will continue 
demand a certain item after the price of some other items 
was increased for completeness we present in the full paper 
 a proof for the efficiency of such auctions for substitutes 
valuations 
 
a unit-demand valuation is an xor valuation in which 
all the atomic bundles are singletons oxs valuations can 
be interpreted as an aggregation or of any number of 
unit-demand bidders 
bid v ac v bd v cd α ∈ 
bid v ab v cd v bd β ∈ 
figure anonymous ascending bundle-price auctions 
cannot determine the optimal allocation for this class of 
valuations 
a price of a bundle that should be demanded by the other 
bidder in the future 
theorem some classes of valuations cannot be 
elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions 
proof consider a pair of xor valuations as described 
in figure for finding the optimal allocation we must know 
which value is greater between α and β 
however we 
cannot learn the value of both α and β by a single ascending 
trajectory assume w l o g that bidder demands cd before 
bidder demands bd no information will be elicited if none 
of these happens in this case the price for bd must be 
greater than otherwise bidder prefers bd to cd thus 
bidder will never demand the bundle bd and no 
information will be elicited about β 
the valuations described in the proof of theorem can 
be easily elicited by a non-anonymous item-price ascending 
auction on the other hand the valuations in figure can 
be easily elicited by an anonymous bundle-price ascending 
auction we conclude that the power of these two families 
of ascending auctions is incomparable 
we strengthen the impossibility result above by showing 
that anonymous bundle-price auctions cannot even achieve 
better than a min o n o 
√ 
m -approximation for the 
social welfare this approximation ratio can be achieved with 
polynomial communication and specifically with a 
polynomial number of item-price demand queries 
theorem an anonymous bundle-price ascending 
auction cannot guarantee better than a min n 
 
 
√ 
m 
 
 
approximation for the optimal welfare 
proof sketch assume we have n bidders and n 
items 
for sale and that n is prime we construct n 
distinct 
bundles with the following properties for each bidder we define 
a partition si 
 si 
 si 
n of the n 
items to n bundles 
such that any two bundles from different partitions intersect 
in the full paper part ii we show an explicit construction 
using the properties of linear functions over finite fields the 
rest of the proof is independent of the specific construction 
using these n 
bundles we construct a hard-to-elicit 
class every bidder has an atomic bid in his xor valuation 
for each of these n 
bundles a bidder i has a value of for 
any bundle si 
j in his partition for all bundles in the other 
partitions he has a value of either or of − δ and these 
values are unknown to the auctioneer since every pair of 
bundles from different partitions intersect only one bidder 
can receive a bundle with a value of 
 
if α β the optimal allocation will allocate cd to bidder 
 and ab to bidder otherwise we give bd to bidder and 
ac to bidder note that both bidders cannot gain a value 
of in the same allocation due to the intersections of the 
high-valued bundles 
 
note that bundle-price queries may use exponential 
communication thus the lower bound of does not hold 
 
non-anonymous bundle-price economically-efficient 
ascending auctions 
initialization all prices are initialized to zero 
 non-anonymous bundle prices 
repeat - each bidder submits a bundle that maximizes his 
utility under his current personalized prices 
- the auctioneer calculates a provisional allocation that 
maximizes his revenue under the current prices 
- the prices of bundles that were demanded by losing 
bidders are increased by 
finally terminate when the provisional allocation assigns 
to each bidder the bundle he demanded 
figure auctions from this family denoted by nbea 
auctions are known to achieve the optimal welfare 
no bidder will demand a low-valued bundle as long as the 
price of one of his high-valued bundles is below and thus 
gain him a utility greater than therefore for eliciting 
any information about the low-valued bundles the 
auctioneer should first arbitrarily choose a bidder w l o g bidder 
 and raise the prices of all the bundles s 
 s 
n to be 
greater than since the prices cannot decrease the other 
bidders will clearly never demand these bundles in future 
stages an adversary may choose the values such that the 
low values of all the bidders for the bundles not in bidder s 
partition are zero i e vi s 
j for every i and every 
j however allocating each bidder a different bundle from 
bidder s partition might achieve a welfare of n − n− δ 
 bidder s valuation is and − δ for all other bidders 
if these bundles were wrongly allocated only a welfare of 
 might be achieved for bidder s high-valued bundle 
for all other bidders at this point the auctioneer cannot 
have any information about the identity of the bundles with 
the non-zero values therefore an adversary can choose the 
values of the bundles received by bidders n in the final 
allocation to be zero we conclude that anonymous 
bundleprice auctions cannot guarantee a welfare greater than for 
this class where the optimal welfare can be arbitrarily close 
to n 
 bundle prices vs item prices 
the core of the auctions in is the scheme described 
in figure in the spirit of for auctions with 
nonanonymous bundle prices auctions from this scheme end 
up with the optimal allocation for any class of valuations 
we denote this family of ascending auctions as nbea 
auctions 
 
nbea auctions can elicit k-term xor valuations by a 
polynomial in k number of steps although the elicitation 
of such valuations may require an exponential number of 
item-price queries and item-price ascending auctions 
cannot do it at all theorem nevertheless we show 
that nbea auctions and in particular ibundle and the 
proxy auction are sometimes inferior to simple item-price 
demand auctions this may justify the use of hybrid 
auctions that use both linear and non-linear prices e g the 
clock-proxy auction we show that auctions from this 
 
non-anonymous bundle-price economically efficient 
ascending auctions for completeness we give in the full 
paper a simple proof for the efficiency up to an of 
auctions of this scheme 
family may use an exponential number of queries even for 
determining the optimal allocation among two bidders with 
additive valuations 
 where such valuations can be elicited 
by a simple item-price ascending auction we actually prove 
this property for a wider class of auctions we call 
conservative auctions we also observe that in conservative auctions 
allowing the bidders to submit all the bundles in their 
demand sets ensures that the auction runs a polynomial 
number of steps - if l is not too high but with exponential 
communication of course 
an ascending auction is called conservative if it is 
nonanonymous uses bundle prices initialized to zero and at 
every stage the auctioneer can only raise prices of bundles 
demanded by the bidders until this stage in addition each 
bidder can only receive bundles he demanded during the 
auction note that nbea auctions are by definition 
conservative 
proposition if every bidder demands a single 
bundle in each step of the auction conservative auctions may 
run for an exponential number of steps even for additive 
valuations if the bidders are allowed to submit all the bundles 
in their demand sets in each step then conservative auctions 
can run in a polynomial number of steps for any profile of 
valuations as long as the maximal valuation l is polynomial 
in m n and 
δ
