 introduction 
a wireless sensor network wsn consists of a large number of 
in-situ battery-powered sensor nodes a wsn can collect the data 
about physical phenomena of interest there are many 
potential applications of wsns including environmental monitoring and 
surveillance etc 
in many application scenarios wsns are employed to conduct 
surveillance tasks in adverse or even worse in hostile working 
environments one major problem caused is that sensor nodes are 
subjected to failures therefore fault tolerance of a wsn is 
critical 
one way to achieve fault tolerance is that a wsn should contain 
a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node 
failures it is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be 
working in sleeping mode i e major power-consuming units such 
as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be shut off to 
save energy and thus to prolong the network lifetime redundancy 
should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that 
are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network 
area 
we find that the minimum distance between each pair of points 
normalized by the average distance between each pair of points 
serves as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points we 
call this index denoted by ι the normalized minimum distance if 
points are moveable we find that maximizing ι results in a 
honeycomb structure the honeycomb structure poses that the coverage 
efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that 
is providing surveillance work employing ι in coverage-related 
problems is thus deemed promising 
this enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to 
select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the 
surveillance work of the network area to explore the effectiveness of 
employing ι in coverage-related problems we formulate a 
sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy wsns an algorithm called 
maximizing-ι node-deduction mind is proposed in which 
redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of 
sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of 
the network area we also introduce another greedy solution called 
incremental coverage quality algorithm icqa for this problem 
which serves as a benchmark to evaluate mind 
the main contribution of this paper is twofold first we 
introduce a novel index ι for evaluation of point-distribution we show 
that maximizing ι of a wsn results in low redundancy of the 
network second we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem 
for wsns and provide a general sensing model with the mind 
algorithm we show that locally maximizing ι among each sensor 
node and its neighbors is a good approach to solve this problem 
this demonstrates a good application of employing ι in 
coveragerelated problems 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section we 
introduce our point-distribution index ι we survey related work 
and formulate a sensor-grouping problem together with a general 
sensing model in section section investigates the application 
of ι in this grouping problem we propose mind for this problem 
 
and introduce icqa as a benchmark in section we present 
our simulation results in which mind and icqa are compared 
section provides conclusion remarks 
 the normalized minimum distance 
ι a point-distribution index 
suppose there are n points in a euclidean space ω the 
coordinates of these points are denoted by xi i n 
it may be necessary to evaluate how the distribution of these 
points is there are many metrics to achieve this goal for 
example the mean square error from these points to their mean value 
can be employed to calculate how these points deviate from their 
mean i e their central in resource-sharing evaluation the global 
fairness index gfi is often employed to measure how even the 
resource distributes among these points when xi represents the 
amount of resource that belong to point i in wsns gfi is usually 
used to calculate how even the remaining energy of sensor nodes 
is 
when n is larger than and the points do not all overlap that 
points all overlap means xi xj ∀ i j n we propose 
a novel index called the normalized minimum distance namely ι 
to evaluate the distribution of the points ι is the minimum distance 
between each pair of points normalized by the average distance 
between each pair of points it is calculated by 
ι 
min xi − xj 
µ 
 ∀ i j n and i j 
where xi − xj denotes the euclidean distance between point 
i and point j in ω the min · function calculates the minimum 
distance between each pair of points and µ is the average distance 
between each pair of points which is 
µ

ι measures how well the points separate from one another 
obviously ι is in interval ι is equal to if and only if n is equal 
to and these three points forms an equilateral triangle ι is equal 
to zero if any two points overlap ι is a very interesting value of a 
set of points if we consider each xi ∀i n is a variable in 
ω how these n points would look like if ι is maximized 
an algorithm is implemented to generate the topology in which 
ι is locally maximized the algorithm can be found in we 
consider a -dimensional space we select n 
and perform this algorithm in order to avoid that the algorithm 
converge to local optimum we select different random seeds to 
generate the initial points for time and obtain the best one 
that results in the largest ι when the algorithm converges figure 
demonstrates what the resulting topology looks like when n 
as an example 
suppose each point represents a sensor node if the sensor 
coverage model is the boolean coverage model and 
the coverage radius of each node is the same it is exciting to see 
that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the vonoroi 
diagram formed by these nodes a vonoroi diagram formed by 
a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such 
that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node 
is a honeycomb-like structure 
 
this enlightens us that ι may be employed to solve problems 
related to sensor-coverage of an area in wsns it is desirable 
 
this is how base stations of a wireless cellular network are 
deployed and why such a network is called a cellular one

figure node number ι 
that the active sensor nodes that are performing surveillance task 
should separate from one another under the constraint that the 
sensing area should be covered the more each node separates from 
the others the less the redundancy of the coverage is ι indicates 
the quality of such separation it should be useful for approaches 
on sensor-coverage related problems 
in our following discussions we will show the effectiveness of 
employing ι in sensor-grouping problem 
 the sensor-grouping problem 
in many application scenarios to achieve fault tolerance a wsn 
contains a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate 
node failures a node sleeping-working schedule scheme is 
therefore highly desired to exploit the redundancy of working sensors 
and let as many nodes as possible sleep 
much work in the literature is on this issue yan et al 
introduced a differentiated service in which a sensor node finds out 
its responsible working duration with cooperation of its neighbors 
to ensure the coverage of sampled points ye et al developed 
peas in which sensor nodes wake up randomly over time probe 
their neighboring nodes and decide whether they should begin to 
take charge of surveillance work xing et al exploited a 
probabilistic distributed detection model with a protocol called 
coordinating grid co-grid wang et al designed an approach called 
coverage configuration protocol ccp which introduced the 
notion that the coverage degree of intersection-points of the 
neighboring nodes sensing-perimeters indicates the coverage of a convex 
region in our recent work we also provided a sleeping 
configuration protocol namely sscp in which sleeping eligibility 
of a sensor node is determined by a local voronoi diagram sscp 
can provide different levels of redundancy to maintain different 
requirements of fault tolerance 
the major feature of the aforementioned protocols is that they 
employ online distributed and localized algorithms in which a 
sensor node determines its sleeping eligibility and or sleeping time 
based on the coverage requirement of its sensing area with some 
information provided by its neighbors 
another major approach for sensor node sleeping-working 
scheduling issue is to group sensor nodes sensor nodes in a network are 
divided into several disjoint sets each set of sensor nodes are able 
to maintain the required area surveillance work the sensor nodes 
are scheduled according to which set they belong to these sets 
work successively only one set of sensor nodes work at any time 
we call the issue sensor-grouping problem 
the major advantage of this approach is that it avoids the 
overhead caused by the processes of coordination of sensor nodes to 
make decision on whether a sensor node is a candidate to sleep or 
 
work and how long it should sleep or work such processes should 
be performed from time to time during the lifetime of a network in 
many online distributed and localized algorithms the large 
overhead caused by such processes is the main drawback of the 
online distributed and localized algorithms on the contrary roughly 
speaking this approach groups sensor nodes in one time and 
schedules when each set of sensor nodes should be on duty it does not 
require frequent decision-making on working sleeping eligibility 
 
in by slijepcevic et al the sensing area is divided into 
regions sensor nodes are grouped with the most-constrained 
leastconstraining algorithm it is a greedy algorithm in which the 
priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many 
uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by 
this sensor in by cardei et al disjoint sensor sets are 
modeled as disjoint dominating sets although maximum dominating 
sets computation is np-complete the authors proposed a 
graphcoloring based algorithm cardei et al also studied similar problem 
in the domain of covering target points in the np-completeness 
of the problem is proved and a heuristic that computes the sets are 
proposed these algorithms are centralized solutions of 
sensorgrouping problem 
however global information e g the location of each in-network 
sensor node of a large scale wsn is also very expensive to 
obtained online also it is usually infeasible to obtain such 
information before sensor nodes are deployed for example sensor nodes 
are usually deployed in a random manner and the location of each 
in-network sensor node is determined only after a node is deployed 
the solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on 
locally obtainable information of a sensor node that is to say nodes 
should determine which group they should join in a fully 
distributed way here locally obtainable information refers to a node s 
local information and the information that can be directly obtained 
from its adjacent nodes i e nodes within its communication range 
in subsection we provide a general problem formulation of 
the sensor-grouping problem distributed-solution requirement is 
formulated in this problem it is followed by discussion in 
subsection on a general sensing model which serves as a given 
condition of the sensor-grouping problem formulation 
to facilitate our discussions the notations in our following 
discussions are described as follows 
 n the number in-network sensor nodes 
 s j j m the jth set of sensor nodes where m 
is the number of sets 
 l i i n the physical location of node i 
 φ the area monitored by the network i e the sensing area 
of the network 
 r the sensing radius of a sensor node we assume that 
a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular 
area centered at the node with a radius equal to r this is 
a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage 
related problems we call this circular area the sensing area 
of a node 
 problem formulation 
we assume that each sensor node can know its approximate 
physical location the approximate location information is obtainable 
if each sensor node carries a gps receiver or if some localization 
algorithms are employed e g 
 
note that if some nodes die a re-grouping process might also be 
performed to exploit the remaining nodes in a set of sensor nodes 
how to provide this mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper 
and yet to be explored 
problem given 
 the set of each sensor node i s sensing neighbors n i and 
the location of each member in n i 
 a sensing model which quantitatively describes how a point 
p in area φ is covered by sensor nodes that are responsible to 
monitor this point we call this quantity the coverage quality 
of p 
 the coverage quality requirement in φ denoted by s when 
the coverage of a point is larger than this threshold we say 
this point is covered 
for each sensor node i make a decision on which group s j it 
should join so that 
 area φ can be covered by sensor nodes in each set s j 
 m the number of sets s j is maximized 
in this formulation we call sensor nodes within a circular area 
centered at a sensor node i with a radius equal to · r the sensing 
neighbors of node i this is because sensors nodes in this area 
together with node i may be cooperative to ensure the coverage of 
a point inside node i s sensing area 
we assume that the communication range of a sensor node is 
larger than · r which is also a general assumption in work that 
addresses sensor-coverage related problems that is to say the first 
given condition in problem is the information that can be obtained 
directly from a node s adjacent nodes it is therefore locally 
obtainable information the last two given conditions in this problem 
formulation can be programmed into a node before it is deployed 
or by a node-programming protocol e g during network 
runtime therefore the given conditions can all be easily obtained by 
a sensor-grouping scheme with fully distributed implementation 
we reify this problem with a realistic sensing model in next 
subsection 
 a general sensing model 
as wsns are usually employed to monitor possible events in a 
given area it is therefore a design requirement that an event 
occurring in the network area must may be successfully detected by 
sensors 
this issue is usually formulated as how to ensure that an event 
signal omitted in an arbitrary point in the network area can be 
detected by sensor nodes obviously a sensing model is required to 
address this problem so that how a point in the network area is 
covered can be modeled and quantified thus the coverage quality of 
a wsn can be evaluated 
different applications of wsns employ different types of 
sensors which surely have widely different theoretical and physical 
characteristics therefore to fulfill different application 
requirements different sensing models should be constructed based on the 
characteristics of the sensors employed 
a simple theoretical sensing model is the boolean sensing model 
 boolean sensing model assumes that a sensor 
node can always detect an event occurring in its responsible 
sensing area but most sensors detect events according to the signal 
strength sensed event signals usually fade in relation to the 
physical distance between an event and the sensor the larger the 
distance the weaker the event signals that can be sensed by the sensor 
which results in a reduction of the probability that the event can be 
successfully detected by the sensor 
as in wsns event signals are usually electromagnetic acoustic 
or photic signals they fade exponentially with the increasing of 
 
their transmit distance specifically the signal strength e d of an 
event that is received by a sensor node satisfies 
e d 
α 
dβ 
 
where d is the physical distance from the event to the sensor node 
α is related to the signal strength omitted by the event and β is 
signal fading factor which is typically a positive number larger than 
or equal to usually α and β are considered as constants 
based on this notion to be more reasonable researchers propose 
collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements 
area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor 
nodes for a point with physical location l the point is considered 
covered by the collaboration of i sensors denoted by k ki if 
and only if the following two equations holds 
∀j i l kj − l r 
c l 
ix 
j 
 e l kj − l s 
c l is regarded as the coverage quality of location l in the 
network area 
however we notice that defining the sensibility as the sum of the 
sensed signal strength by each collaborative sensor implies a very 
special application applications must employ the sum of the 
signal strength to achieve decision-making to capture generally 
realistic application requirement we modify the definition described 
in equation the model we adopt in this paper is described in 
details as follows 
we consider the probability p l kj that an event located at l 
can be detected by sensor kj is related to the signal strength sensed 
by kj formally 
p l kj γe d 
δ 
 l kj − l β 
 
where γ is a constant and δ γα is a constant too normalizes 
the distance to a proper scale and the item is to avoid infinite 
value of p l kj 
the probability that an event located at l can be detected by any 
collaborative sensors that satisfied equation is 
p l − 
iy 
j 
 − p l kj 
as the detection probability p l reasonably determines how 
an event occurring at location l can be detected by the networks it 
is a good measure of the coverage quality of location l in a wsn 
specifically equation is modified to 
c l p l 
 − 
iy 
j 
 − 
δ 
 l kj − l β 
 s 
to sum it up we consider a point at location l is covered if 
equation and hold 
 maximizing-ι node-deduction 
algorithm for sensor-grouping 
problem 
before we process to introduce algorithms to solve the sensor 
grouping problem let us define the margin denoted by θ of an 
area φ monitored by the network as the band-like marginal area 
of φ and all the points on the outer perimeter of θ is ρ distance 
away from all the points on the inner perimeter of θ ρ is called the 
margin length 
in a practical network sensor nodes are usually evenly deployed 
in the network area obviously the number of sensor nodes that 
can sense an event occurring in the margin of the network is smaller 
than the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring 
in other area of the network based on this consideration in our 
algorithm design we ensure the coverage quality of the network 
area except the margin the information on φ and ρ is 
networkbased each in-network sensor node can be pre-programmed or 
on-line informed about φ and ρ and thus calculate whether a point 
in its sensing area is in the margin or not 
 maximizing-ι node-deduction algorithm 
the node-deduction process of our maximizing-ι node-deduction 
algorithm mind is simple a node i greedily maximizes ι of the 
sub-network composed by itself its ungrouped sensing neighbors 
and the neighbors that are in the same group of itself under the 
constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be 
ensured node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one the 
candidate to be pruned satisfies that 
 it is an ungrouped node 
 the deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points 
inside the sensing area of i 
a candidate is deleted if the deletion of the candidate results in 
largest ι of the sub-network compared to the deletion of other 
candidates this node-deduction process continues until no candidate 
can be found then all the ungrouped sensing neighbors that are 
not deleted are grouped into the same group of node i we call the 
sensing neighbors that are in the same group of node i the group 
sensing neighbors of node i we then call node i a finished node 
meaning that it has finished the above procedure and the sensing 
area of the node is covered those nodes that have not yet finished 
this procedure are called unfinished nodes 
the above procedure initiates at a random-selected node that is 
not in the margin the node is grouped to the first group it 
calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above 
procedure it informs these group sensing neighbors that they are 
selected in the group then it hands over the above procedure to 
an unfinished group sensing neighbors that is the farthest from 
itself this group sensing neighbor continues this procedure until no 
unfinished neighbor can be found then the first group is formed 
 algorithmic description of this procedure can be found at 
after a group is formed another random-selected ungrouped 
node begins to group itself to the second group and initiates the 
above procedure in this way groups are formed one by one when 
a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage 
quality if its sensing area except what overlaps the network margin 
cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are 
grouped into the same group as itself the algorithm stops mind 
is based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes it is 
a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of 
problem 
 incremental coverage quality algorithm 
a benchmark for mind 
to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing ι in the sensor-group 
problem another algorithm for sensor-group problem called 
incremental coverage quality algorithm icqa is designed our aim 
 
is to evaluate how an idea i e mind based on locally maximize 
ι performs 
in icqa a node-selecting process is as follows a node i 
greedily selects an ungrouped sensing neighbor in the same group as 
itself one by one and informs the neighbor it is selected in the group 
the criterion is 
 the selected neighbor is responsible to provide surveillance 
work for some uncovered parts of node i s sensing area i e 
the coverage quality requirement of the parts is not fulfilled 
if this neighbor is not selected 
 the selected neighbor results in highest improvement of the 
coverage quality of the neighbor s sensing area 
the improvement of the coverage quality mathematically should 
be the integral of the the improvements of all points inside the 
neighbor s sensing area a numerical approximation is employed 
to calculate this improvement details are presented in our 
simulation study 
this node-selecting process continues until the sensing area of 
node i is entirely covered in this way node i s group sensing 
neighbors are found the above procedure is handed over as what 
mind does and new groups are thus formed one by one and 
the condition that icqa stops is the same as mind icqa is also 
based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes icqa is 
also a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution 
of problem 
 simulation results 
to evaluate the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping 
problem we build simulation surveillance networks we employ 
mind and icqa to group the in-network sensor nodes we 
compare the grouping results with respect to how many groups both 
algorithms find and how the performance of the resulting groups 
are 
detailed settings of the simulation networks are shown in table

for evaluating the coverage quality of the sensing area of a node 
we divide the sensing area of a node into several regions and regard 
the coverage quality of the central point in each region as a 
representative of the coverage quality of the region this is a numerical 
approximation larger number of such regions results in better 
approximation as sensor nodes are with low computational 
capacity there is a tradeoff between the number of such regions and the 
precision of the resulting coverage quality of the sensing area of a 
node in our simulation study we set this number for 
evaluating the improvement of coverage quality in icqa we sum up all 
the improvements at each region-center as the total improvement 
 number of groups formed by mind and 
icqa 
we set the total in-network node number to different values and 
let the networks perform mind and icqa for each n 
simulations run with several random seeds to generate different networks 
results are averaged figure shows the group numbers found in 
networks with different n s

figure the number of groups found by mind and icqa 
we can see that mind always outperforms icqa in terms of 
the number of groups formed obviously the larger the number of 
groups can be formed the more the redundancy of each group is 
exploited this output shows that an approach like mind that aim 
to maximize ι of the resulting topology can exploits redundancy 
well 
as an example in case that n the results of five 
networks are listed in table 
table the grouping results of five networks with n

the difference between the average ι of the groups in each 
network shows that groups formed by mind result in topologies with 
larger ι s it demonstrates that ι is good indicator of redundancy in 
different networks 
 the performance of the resulting groups 
although mind forms more groups than icqa does which 
implies longer lifetime of the networks another importance 
consideration is how these groups formed by mind and icqa perform 
we let events randomly occur in the network area except 
the margin we compare how many events happen at the locations 
where the quality is less than the requirement s when each 
resulting group is conducting surveillance work we call the 
number of such events the failure number of group figure shows 
the average failure numbers of the resulting groups when different 
node numbers are set 
we can see that the groups formed by mind outperform those 
formed by icqa because the groups formed by mind result in 
lower failure numbers this further demonstrates that mind is a 
good approach for sensor-grouping problem

 conclusion 
this paper proposes ι a novel index for evaluation of 
pointdistribution ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points 
normalized by the average distance between each pair of points 
we find that a set of points that achieve a maximum value of ι 
result in a honeycomb structure we propose that ι can serve as a 
good index to evaluate the distribution of the points which can be 
employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks 
 wsns we set out to validate this idea by employing ι to a 
sensorgrouping problem we formulate a general sensor-grouping 
problem for wsns and provide a general sensing model with an 
algorithm called maximizing-ι node-deduction mind we show that 
maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good approach to solve this 
problem simulation results verify that mind outperforms a greedy 
algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design in terms of the 
number and the performance of the groups formed this 
demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coverage-related 
problems
