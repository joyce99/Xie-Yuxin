abstract 
billions of dollars are spent each year on sponsored search 
a form of advertising where merchants pay for placement 
alongside web search results slots for ad listings are 
allocated via an auction-style mechanism where the higher a 
merchant bids the more likely his ad is to appear above 
other ads on the page in this paper we analyze the 
incentive efficiency and revenue properties of two slot 
auction designs rank by bid rbb and rank by revenue 
 rbr which correspond to stylized versions of the 
mechanisms currently used by yahoo and google respectively 
we also consider first- and second-price payment rules 
together with each of these allocation rules as both have been 
used historically we consider both the short-run 
incomplete information setting and the long-run complete 
information setting with incomplete information neither rbb 
nor rbr are truthful with either first or second pricing we 
find that the informational requirements of rbb are much 
weaker than those of rbr but that rbr is efficient whereas 
rbb is not we also show that no revenue ranking of rbb 
and rbr is possible given an arbitrary distribution over 
bidder values and relevance with complete information 
we find that no equilibrium exists with first pricing using 
either rbb or rbr we show that there typically exists a 
multitude of equilibria with second pricing and we bound 
the divergence of economic value in such equilibria from 
the value obtained assuming all merchants bid truthfully

 introduction 
today internet giants google and yahoo boast a 
combined market capitalization of over billion largely on 
the strength of sponsored search the fastest growing 
component of a resurgent online advertising industry 
pricewaterhousecoopers estimates that industry-wide sponsored 
search revenues were billion or of total 
internet advertising revenues 
industry watchers expect 
revenues to reach or exceed billion 
roughly of 
google s estimated billion in revenue and roughly 
 of yahoo s estimated billion in revenue will 
likely be attributable to sponsored search 
a number of 
other companies-including looksmart findwhat 
interactivecorp ask jeeves and ebay shopping com -earn 
hundreds of millions of dollars of sponsored search revenue 
annually 
sponsored search is a form of advertising where merchants 
pay to appear alongside web search results for example 
when a user searches for used honda accord san diego in 
a web search engine a variety of commercial entities san 
diego car dealers honda corp automobile information 
portals classified ad aggregators ebay etc may bid to to 
have their listings featured alongside the standard 
algorithmic search listings advertisers bid for placement on the 
page in an auction-style format where the higher they bid 
the more likely their listing will appear above other ads on 
the page by convention sponsored search advertisers 
generally pay per click meaning that they pay only when a user 
clicks on their ad and do not pay if their ad is displayed but 
not clicked though many people claim to systematically 
ignore sponsored search ads majestic research reports that

these are rough back of the envelope estimates google 
and yahoo revenue estimates were obtained from 
yahoo finance we assumed billion in industry-wide 
sponsored search revenues we used nielsen netratings 
estimates of search engine market share in the us the most 
monetized market 
wired-vig wired com news technology html 
using comscore s international search engine market share 
estimates would yield different estimates

as many as of google searches result in a paid click and 
that google earns roughly nine cents on average for every 
search query they process 
usually sponsored search results appear in a separate 
section of the page designated as sponsored above or to the 
right of the algorithmic results sponsored search results 
are displayed in a format similar to algorithmic results as 
a list of items each containing a title a text description 
and a hyperlink to a corresponding web page we call each 
position in the list a slot generally advertisements that 
appear in a higher ranked slot higher on the page garner 
more attention and more clicks from users thus all else 
being equal merchants generally prefer higher ranked slots 
to lower ranked slots 
merchants bid for placement next to particular search 
queries for example orbitz and travelocity may bid for 
las vegas hotel while dell and hp bid for laptop 
computer as mentioned bids are expressed as a maximum 
willingness to pay per click for example a forty-cent bid 
by hostrocket for web hosting means hostrocket is 
willing to pay up to forty cents every time a user clicks on their 
ad 
the auctioneer the search engine 
 evaluates the bids 
and allocates slots to advertisers in principle the 
allocation decision can be altered with each new incoming search 
query so in effect new auctions clear continuously over time 
as search queries arrive 
many allocation rules are plausible in this paper we 
investigate two allocation rules roughly corresponding to the 
two allocation rules used by yahoo and google the rank 
by bid rbb allocation assigns slots in order of bids with 
higher ranked slots going to higher bidders the rank by 
revenue rbr allocation assigns slots in order of the 
product of bid times expected relevance where relevance is the 
proportion of users that click on the merchant s ad after 
viewing it in our model we assume that an ad s expected 
relevance is known to the auctioneer and the advertiser but 
not necessarily to other advertisers and that clickthrough 
rate decays monotonically with lower ranked slots in 
practice the expected clickthrough rate depends on a number 
of factors including the position on the page the ad text 
 which in turn depends on the identity of the bidder the 
nature and intent of the user and the context of other ads 
and algorithmic results on the page and must be learned 
over time by both the auctioneer and the bidder as of 
this writing to a rough first-order approximation yahoo 
employs a rbb allocation and google employs a rbr 
allocation though numerous caveats apply in both cases when 
it comes to the vagaries of real-world implementations 
even when examining a one-shot version of a slot 
auction the mechanism differs from a standard multi-item 
auc

usually advertisers also set daily or monthly budget caps 
in this paper we do not model budget constraints 
 
in the sponsored search industry the auctioneer and search 
engine are not always the same entity for example google 
runs the sponsored search ads for aol web search with 
revenue being shared similarly yahoo currently runs the 
sponsored search ads for msn web search though microsoft 
will begin independent operations soon 
 
here are two among many exceptions to the yahoo 
rbb and google rbr assertion yahoo excludes 
ads deemed insufficiently relevant either by a human editor 
or due to poor historical click rate google sets differing 
reserve prices depending on google s estimate of ad quality 
tion in subtle ways first a single bid per merchant is used 
to allocate multiple non-identical slots second the bid is 
communicated not as a direct preference over slots but as 
a preference for clicks that depend stochastically on slot 
allocation 
we investigate a number of economic properties of rbb 
and rbr slot auctions we consider the short-run 
incomplete information case in section adapting and 
extending standard analyses of single-item auctions in section 
we turn to the long-run complete information case our 
characterization results here draw on techniques from 
linear programming throughout important observations are 
highlighted as claims supported by examples our 
contributions are as follows 
 we show that with multiple slots bidders do not reveal 
their true values with either rbb or rbr and with 
either first- or second-pricing 
 with incomplete information we find that the 
informational requirements of playing the equilibrium bid 
are much weaker for rbb than for rbr because 
bidders need not know any information about each others 
relevance or even their own with rbb 
 with incomplete information we prove that rbr is 
efficient but that rbb is not 
 we show via a simple example that no general revenue 
ranking of rbb and rbr is possible 
 we prove that in a complete-information setting 
firstprice slot auctions have no pure strategy nash 
equilibrium but that there always exists a pure-strategy 
equilibrium with second pricing 
 we provide a constant-factor bound on the deviation 
from efficiency that can occur in the equilibrium of a 
second-price slot auction 
in section we specify our model of bidders and the 
various slot auction formats 
in section we study the incentive properties of each 
format asking in which cases agents would bid truthfully 
there is possible confusion here because the second-price 
design for slot auctions is reminiscent of the vickrey auction 
for a single item we note that for slot auctions the vickrey 
mechanism is in fact very different from the second-price 
mechanism and so they have different incentive properties 
in section we derive the bayes-nash equilibrium bids 
for the various auction formats this is useful for the 
efficiency and revenue results in later sections it should 
become clear in this section that slot auctions in our model 
are a straightforward generalization of single-item auctions 
sections and address questions of efficiency and 
revenue under incomplete information respectively 
in section we determine whether pure-strategy 
equilibria exist for the various auction formats under complete 
information in section we derive bounds on the 
deviation from efficiency in the pure-strategy equilibria of 
secondprice slot auctions 
our approach is positive rather than normative we aim 
to clarify the incentive efficiency and revenue properties of 
two slot auction designs currently in use under settings of 
 
other authors have also made this observation 
 
incomplete and complete information we do not attempt 
to derive the optimal mechanism for a slot auction 
related work feng et al compare the revenue 
performance of various ranking mechanisms for slot auctions 
in a model with incomplete information much as we do in 
section but they obtain their results via simulations 
whereas we perform an equilibrium analysis 
liu and chen study properties of slot auctions under 
incomplete information their setting is essentially the same 
as ours except they restrict their attention to a model with 
a single slot and a binary type for bidder relevance high or 
low they find that rbr is efficient but that no general 
revenue ranking of rbb and rbr is possible which agrees 
with our results they also take a design approach and 
show how the auctioneer should assign relevance scores to 
optimize its revenue 
edelman et al model the slot auction problem both as 
a static game of complete information and a dynamic game 
of incomplete information they study the locally 
envyfree equilibria of the static game of complete information 
this is a solution concept motivated by certain bidding 
behaviors that arise due to the presence of budget constraints 
they do not view slot auctions as static games of 
incomplete information as we do but do study them as dynamic 
games of incomplete information and derive results on the 
uniqueness and revenue properties of the resulting 
equilibria they also provide a nice description of the evolution of 
the market for sponsored search 
varian also studies slot auctions under a setting of 
complete information he focuses on symmetric 
equilibria which are a refinement of nash equilibria appropriate for 
slot auctions he provides bounds on the revenue obtained 
in equilibrium he also gives bounds that can be used to 
infer bidder values given their bids and performs some 
empirical analysis using these results in contrast we focus 
instead on efficiency and provide bounds on the deviation 
from efficiency in complete-information equilibria 
 preliminaries 
we focus on a slot auction for a single keyword in a 
setting of incomplete information a bidder knows only 
distributions over others private information value per click 
and relevance with complete information a bidder knows 
others private information and so does not need to rely on 
distributions to strategize we first describe the model for 
the case with incomplete information and drop the 
distributional information from the model when we come to the 
complete-information case in section 
 the model 
there is a fixed number k of slots to be allocated among 
n bidders we assume without loss of generality that k ≤ 
n since superfluous slots can remain blank bidder i assigns 
a value of xi to each click received on its advertisement 
regardless of this advertisement s rank 
the probability 
that i s advertisement will be clicked if viewed is ai ∈ 
we refer to ai as bidder i s relevance we refer to ri 
aixi as bidder i s revenue the xi ai and ri are random 
 
indeed kitts et al find that in their sample of actual 
click data the correlation between rank and conversion rate 
is not statistically significant however for the purposes 
of our model it is also important that bidders believe that 
conversion rate does not vary with rank 
variables and we denote their realizations by xi αi and ri 
respectively the probability that an advertisement will be 
viewed if placed in slot j is γj ∈ we assume γ 
γ γk hence bidder i s advertisement will have a 
clickthrough rate of γjαi if placed in slot j of course an 
advertisement does not receive any clicks if it is not allocated 
a slot 
each bidder s value and relevance pair xi ai is 
independently and identically distributed on ¯x × according 
to a continuous density function f that has full support on 
its domain the density f and slot probabilities γ γk 
are common knowledge only bidder i knows the 
realization xi of its value per click xi both bidder i and the seller 
know the realization αi of ai but this realization remains 
unobservable to the other bidders 
we assume that bidders have quasi-linear utility 
functions that is the expected utility to bidder i of obtaining 
the slot of rank j at a price of b per click is 
ui j b γjαi xi − b 
if the advertising firms bidding in the slot auction are 
riskneutral and have ample liquidity quasi-linearity is a 
reasonable assumption 
the assumptions of independence symmetry and 
riskneutrality made above are all quite standard in single-item 
auction theory the assumption that clickthrough 
rate decays monotonically with lower slots-by the same 
factors for each agent-is unique to the slot auction 
problem we view it as a main contribution of our work to 
show that this assumption allows for tractable analysis of 
the slot auction problem using standard tools from 
singleitem auction theory it also allows for interesting results in 
the complete information case a common model of 
decaying clickthrough rate is the exponential decay model where 
γk 
δk− with decay δ feng et al state that 
their actual clickthrough data is fitted extremely well by an 
exponential decay model with δ 
our model lacks budget constraints which are an 
important feature of real slot auctions with budget constraints 
keyword auctions cannot be considered independently of one 
another because the budget must be allocated across 
multiple keywords-a single advertiser typically bids on multiple 
keywords relevant to his business introducing this element 
into the model is an important next step for future work 
 auction formats 
in a slot auction a bidder provides to the seller a declared 
value per click ˜xi xi αi which depends on his true value 
and relevance we often denote this declared value bid 
by ˜xi for short since a bidder s relevance αi is observable 
to the seller the bidder cannot misrepresent it we denote 
the kth 
highest of the n declared values by ˜x k 
 and the 
kth 
highest of the n declared revenues by ˜r k 
 where the 
declared revenue of bidder i is ˜ri αi ˜xi we consider two 
types of allocation rules rank by bid rbb and rank 
by revenue rbr 
 
models with budget constraints have begun to appear in 
this research area abrams and borgs et al design 
multi-unit auctions for budget-constrained bidders which 
can be interpreted as slot auctions with a focus on revenue 
optimization and truthfulness mehta et al address 
the problem of matching user queries to budget-constrained 
advertisers so as to maximize revenue 
 
rbb slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜xi ˜x k 
 
rbr slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜ri ˜r k 
 
we will commonly represent an allocation by a one-to-one 
function σ k → n where n is the set of integers 
 n hence slot k goes to bidder σ k 
we also consider two different types of payment rules 
note that no matter what the payment rule a bidder that 
is not allocated a slot will pay since his listing cannot 
receive any clicks 
first-price the bidder allocated slot k namely σ k pays 
˜xσ k per click under both the rbb and rbr 
allocation rules 
second-price if k n bidder σ k pays ˜xσ k per click 
under the rbb rule and pays ˜rσ k ασ k per click 
under the rbr rule if k n bidder σ k pays per 
click 
intuitively a second-price payment rule sets a bidder s 
payment to the lowest bid it could have declared while 
maintaining the same ranking given the allocation rule used 
overture introduced the first slot auction design in 
using a first-price rbb scheme google then followed in 
 with a second-price rbr scheme in overture 
 at this point acquired by yahoo then switched to second 
pricing but still allocates using rbb one possible reason 
for the switch is given in section 
we assume that ties are broken as follows in the event 
that two agents make the exact same bid or declare the 
same revenue there is a permutation of the agents κ 
 n → n that is fixed beforehand if the bids of agents i 
and j are tied then agent i obtains a higher slot if and only 
if κ i κ j this is consistent with the practice in real 
slot auctions where ties are broken by the bidders order of 
arrival 
 incomplete information 
 incentives 
it should be clear that with a first-price payment rule 
truthful bidding is neither a dominant strategy nor an ex 
post nash equilibrium using either rbb or rbr because 
this guarantees a payoff of there is always an incentive 
to shade true values with first pricing 
the second-price payment rule is reminiscent of the 
secondprice vickrey auction used for selling a single item and in 
a vickrey auction it is a dominant strategy for a bidder to 
reveal his true value for the item however using a 
second-price rule in a slot auction together with either 
allocation rule above does not yield an incentive-compatible 
mechanism either in dominant strategies or ex post nash 
equilibrium 
with a second-price rule there is no 
incentive for a bidder to bid higher than his true value per click 
using either rbb or rbr this either leads to no change 
 
we are effectively assuming a reserve price of zero but in 
practice search engines charge a non-zero reserve price per 
click 
 
unless of course there is only a single slot available since 
this is the single-item case with a single slot both rbb 
and rbr with a second-price payment rule are 
dominantstrategy incentive-compatible 
in the outcome or a situation in which he will have to pay 
more than his value per click for each click received 
resulting in a negative payoff 
however with either allocation 
rule there may be an incentive to shade true values with 
second pricing 
claim with second pricing and k ≥ truthful 
bidding is not a dominant strategy nor an ex post nash 
equilibrium for either rbb or rbr 
example there are two agents and two slots the 
agents have relevance α α whereas γ and 
γ agent has a value of x per click and agent 
 has a value of x per click let us first consider the 
rbb rule suppose agent bids truthfully if agent also 
bids truthfully he wins the first slot and obtains a payoff of 
 however if he shades his bid down below he obtains 
the second slot at a cost of per click yielding a payoff of 
 since the agents have equal relevance the exact same 
situation holds with the rbr rule hence truthful bidding 
is not a dominant strategy in either format and neither is 
it an ex post nash equilibrium 
to find payments that make rbb and rbr 
dominantstrategy incentive-compatible we can apply holmstrom s 
lemma see also chapter in milgrom under the 
restriction that a bidder with value per click does not pay 
anything even if he obtains a slot which can occur if there 
are as many slots as bidders this lemma implies that there 
is a unique payment rule that achieves dominant-strategy 
incentive compatibility for either allocation rule for rbb 
the bidder allocated slot k is charged per click 
kx 
i k 
 γi− − γi ˜x i 
 γk ˜x k 
 
note that if k n ˜x k 
 since there is no k th 
bidder for rbr the bidder allocated slot k is charged per 
click 
 
ασ k 
kx 
i k 
 γi− − γi ˜r i 
 γk ˜r k 
 
 
using payment rule and rbr the auctioneer is aware 
of the true revenues of the bidders since they reveal their 
values truthfully and hence ranks them according to their 
true revenues we show in section that this allocation 
is in fact efficient since the vcg mechanism is the unique 
mechanism that is efficient truthful and ensures bidders 
with value pay nothing by the green-laffont theorem 
the rbr rule and payment scheme constitute exactly the 
vcg mechanism 
in the vcg mechanism an agent pays the externality he 
imposes on others to understand payment in this sense 
note that the first term is the added utility due to an 
increased clickthrough rate agents in slots k to k would 
receive if they were all to move up a slot the last term is the 
utility that the agent with the k st 
revenue would receive 
by obtaining the last slot as opposed to nothing the 
leading coefficient simply reduces the agent s expected payment 
to a payment per click 
 
in a dynamic setting with second pricing there may be an 
incentive to bid higher than one s true value in order to 
exhaust competitors budgets this phenomenon is commonly 
called bid jamming or antisocial bidding 
 
 equilibrium analysis 
to understand the efficiency and revenue properties of 
the various auction formats we must first understand which 
rankings of the bidders occur in equilibrium with different 
allocation and payment rule combinations the following 
lemma essentially follows from the monotonic selection 
theorem by milgrom and shannon 
lemma in a rbb rbr auction with either a 
firstor second-price payment rule the symmetric bayes-nash 
equilibrium bid is strictly increasing with value revenue 
as a consequence of this lemma we find that rbb and 
rbr auctions allocate the slots greedily by the true values 
and revenues of the agents respectively whether using 
firstor second-price payment rules this will be relevant in 
section below for a first-price payment rule we can 
explicitly derive the symmetric bayes-nash equilibrium bid 
functions for rbb and rbr auctions the purpose of this 
exercise is to lend qualitative insights into the parameters 
that influence an agent s bidding and to derive formulae for 
the expected revenue in rbb and rbr auctions in order 
to make a revenue ranking of these two allocation rules in 
section 
let g y be the expected resulting clickthrough rate in 
a symmetric equilibrium of the rbb auction with either 
payment rule to a bidder with value y and relevance α 
 let h y be the analogous quantity for a bidder with 
revenue y and relevance in a rbr auction by lemma 
a bidder with value y will obtain slot k in a rbb auction 
if y is the kth 
highest of the true realized values the same 
applies in a rbr auction when y is the kth 
highest of the true 
realized revenues let fx y be the distribution function for 
value and let fr y be the distribution function for revenue 
the probability that y is the kth 
highest out of n values is 
n − 
k − 
 
 − fx y k− 
fx y n−k 
whereas the probability that y is the kth 
highest out of n 
revenues is the same formula with fr replacing fx hence 
we have 
g y 
kx 
k 
γk 
n − 
k − 
 
 − fx y k− 
fx y n−k 
the h function is analogous to g with fr replacing fx 
in the two propositions that follow g and h are the 
derivatives of g and h respectively we omit the proof of the 
next proposition because it is almost identical to the 
derivation of the equilibrium bid in the single-item case see 
krishna proposition 
proposition the symmetric bayes-nash equilibrium 
strategies in a first-price rbb auction are given by 
˜xb 
 x α 
 
g x 
z x 
 
y g y dy 
the first-price equilibrium above closely parallels the 
firstprice equilibrium in the single-item model with a single 
item g is the density of the second highest value among all 
n agent values whereas in a slot auction it is a weighted 
combination of the densities for the second third etc 
highest values 
note that the symmetric bayes-nash equilibrium bid in 
a first-price rbb auction does not depend on a bidder s 
relevance α to see clearly why note that a bidder chooses 
a bid b so as to maximize the objective 
αg ˜x− 
 b x − b 
and here α is just a leading constant factor so dropping 
it does not change the set of optimal solutions hence the 
equilibrium bid depends only on the value x and function 
g and g in turn depends only on the marginal cumulative 
distribution of value fx so really only the latter needs to 
be common knowledge to the bidders on the other hand 
we will now see that information about relevance is needed 
for bidders to play the equilibrium in the first-price rbr 
auction so the informational requirements for a first-price 
rbb auction are much weaker than for a first-price rbr 
auction in the rbb auction a bidder need not know his own 
relevance and need not know any distributional information 
over others relevance in order to play the equilibrium 
again we omit the next proposition s proof since it is so 
similar to the one above 
proposition the symmetric bayes-nash equilibrium 
strategies in a first-price rbr auction are given by 
˜xr 
 x α 
 
αh αx 
z αx 
 
y h y dy 
here it can be seen that the equilibrium bid is increasing 
with x but not necessarily with α this should not be much 
of a concern to the auctioneer however because in any case 
the declared revenue in equilibrium is always increasing in 
the true revenue 
it would be interesting to obtain the equilibrium bids 
when using a second-price payment rule but it appears that 
the resulting differential equations for this case do not have a 
neat analytical solution nonetheless the same conclusions 
about the informational requirements of the rbb and rbr 
rules still hold as can be seen simply by inspecting the 
objective function associated with an agent s bidding problem 
for the second-price case 
 efficiency 
a slot auction is efficient if in equilibrium the sum of the 
bidders revenues from their allocated slots is maximized 
using symmetry as our equilibrium selection criterion we 
find that the rbb auction is not efficient with either 
payment rule 
claim the rbb auction is not efficient with either 
first or second pricing 
example there are two agents and one slot with γ 
 agent has a value of x per click and relevance 
α agent has a value of x per click and 
relevance α by lemma agents are ranked greedily 
by value hence agent obtains the lone slot for a total 
revenue of to the agents however it is most efficient to 
allocate the slot to agent for a total revenue of 
examples with more agents or more slots are simple to 
construct along the same lines on the other hand under 
our assumptions on how clickthrough rate decreases with 
lower rank the rbr auction is efficient with either payment 
rule 
 
theorem the rbr auction is efficient with either 
first- or second-price payments rules 
proof since by lemma the agents equilibrium bids 
are increasing functions of their revenues in the rbr 
auction slots are allocated greedily according to true revenues 
let σ be a non-greedy allocation then there are slots s t 
with s t and rσ s rσ t we can switch the agents in 
slots s and t to obtain a new allocation and the difference 
between the total revenue in this new allocation and the 
original allocation s total revenue is 
 
γtrσ s γsrσ t 
´ 
− 
 
γsrσ s γtrσ t 
´ 
 γs − γt 
 
rσ t − rσ s 
´ 
both parenthesized terms above are positive hence the 
switch has increased the total revenue to the bidders if we 
continue to perform such switches we will eventually reach 
a greedy allocation of greater revenue than the initial 
allocation since the initial allocation was arbitrary it follows 
that a greedy allocation is always efficient and hence the 
rbr auction s allocation is efficient 
note that the assumption that clickthrough rate decays 
montonically by the same factors γ γk for all agents is 
crucial to this result a greedy allocation scheme does not 
necessarily find an efficient solution if the clickthrough rates 
are monotonically decreasing in an independent fashion for 
each agent 
 revenue 
to obtain possible revenue rankings for the different 
auction formats we first note that when the allocation rule is 
fixed to rbb then using either a first-price second-price or 
truthful payment rule leads to the same expected revenue in 
a symmetric increasing bayes-nash equilibrium because 
a rbb auction ranks agents by their true values in 
equilibrium for any of these payment rules by lemma it 
follows that expected revenue is the same for all these 
payment rules following arguments that are virtually identical 
to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the 
singleitem case see e g proposition in krishna the 
same holds for rbr auctions however the revenue ranking 
of the rbb and rbr allocation rules is still unclear 
because of this revenue equivalence principle we can choose 
whichever payment rule is most convenient for the purpose 
of making revenue comparisons 
using propositions and it is a simple matter to 
derive formulae for the expected revenue under both allocation 
rules the payment of an agent in a rbb auction is 
mb 
 x α αg x ˜xv 
 x α 
the expected revenue is then n · e 
ˆ 
mv 
 x a 
˜ 
 where the 
expectation is taken with respect to the joint density of value 
and relevance the expected revenue formula for rbr 
auctions is entirely analogous using ˜xr 
 x α and the h 
function with these in hand we can obtain revenue rankings 
for specific numbers of bidders and slots and specific 
distributions over values and relevance 
claim for fixed k n and fixed γ γk no 
revenue ranking of rbb and rbr is possible for an arbitrary 
density f 
example assume there are bidders slots and that 
γ γ assume that value-relevance pairs are 
uniformly distributed over × for such a 
distribution with a closed-form formula it is most convenient to use 
the revenue formulae just derived rbb dominates rbr in 
terms of revenue for these parameters the formula for the 
expected revenue in a rbb auction yields whereas for 
rbr auctions we have 
assume instead that with probability an agent s 
valuerelevance pair is and that with probability it 
is in this scenario it is more convenient to appeal 
to formulae and in a truthful auction the second 
agent will always pay according to in a truthful 
rbb auction the first agent makes an expected payment of 
e 
ˆ 
 γ − γ aσ xσ 
˜ 
 
 
 
e 
ˆ 
aσ 
˜ 
e 
ˆ 
xσ 
˜ 
where we have used the fact that value and relevance are 
independently distributed for different agents the expected 
relevance of the agent with the highest value is e 
ˆ 
aσ 
˜ 
 
 the expected second highest value is also e 
ˆ 
xσ 
˜ 
 
 the expected revenue for a rbb auction here is then 
 according to in a truthful rbr auction the 
first agent makes an expected payment of

in expectation the second highest revenue is e

 so the expected revenue for a rbr auction is 
hence in this case the rbr auction yields higher expected 
revenue 
this example suggests the following conjecture when 
value and relevance are either uncorrelated or positively 
correlated rbb dominates rbr in terms of revenue when 
value and relevance are negatively correlated rbr 
dominates 
 complete information 
in typical slot auctions such as those run by yahoo and 
google bidders can adjust their bids up or down at any 
time as b¨orgers et al and edelman et al have 
noted this can be viewed as a continuous-time process in 
which bidders learn each other s bids if the process 
stabilizes the result can then be modeled as a nash equilibrium 
in pure strategies of the static one-shot game of complete 
information since each bidder will be playing a best-response 
to the others bids 
this argument seems especially 
appropriate for yahoo s slot auction design where all bids are 
 
to be entirely rigorous and consistent with our initial 
assumptions we should have constructed a continuous 
probability density with full support over an appropriate domain 
taking the domain to be e g × and a continuous 
density with full support that is sufficiently concentrated 
around and with roughly equal mass around 
both would yield the same conclusion 
 
claim should serve as a word of caution because feng 
et al find through their simulations that with a 
bivariate normal distribution over value-relevance pairs and with 
 slots bidders and δ rbr dominates rbb in 
terms of revenue for any level of correlation between value 
and relevance however they assume that bidding behavior 
in a second-price slot auction can be well approximated by 
truthful bidding 
 
we do not claim that bidders will actually learn each 
others private information value and relevance just that for 
a stable set of bids there is a corresponding equilibrium of 
the complete information game 
 
made public google keeps bids private but 
experimentation can allow one to discover other bids especially since 
second pricing automatically reveals to an agent the bid of 
the agent ranked directly below him 
 equilibrium analysis 
in this section we ask whether a pure-strategy nash 
equilibrium exists in a rbb or rbr slot auction with either 
first or second pricing 
before dealing with the first-price case there is a technical 
issue involving ties in our model we allow bids to be 
nonnegative real numbers for mathematical convenience but 
this can become problematic because there is then no bid 
that is just higher than another we brush over such 
issues by assuming that an agent can bid infinitesimally 
higher than another this is imprecise but allows us to 
focus on the intuition behind the result that follows see 
reny for a full treatment of such issues 
for the remainder of the paper we assume that there are 
as many slots as bidders the following result shows that 
there can be no pure-strategy nash equilibrium with first 
pricing 
note that the argument holds for both rbb and 
rbr allocation rules for rbb bids should be interpreted 
as declared values and for rbr as declared revenues 
theorem there exists no complete information nash 
equilibrium in pure strategies in the first-price slot auction 
for any possible values of the agents whether using a rbb 
or rbr allocation rule 
proof let σ k → n be the allocation of slots to 
the agents resulting from their bids let ri and bi be the 
revenue and bid of the agent ranked ith 
 respectively note 
that we cannot have bi bi or else the agent in slot 
i can make a profitable deviation by instead bidding bi − 
 bi for small enough this does not change 
its allocation but increases its profit hence we must have 
bi bi i e with one bidder bidding infinitesimally higher 
than the other since this holds for any two consecutive 
bidders it follows that in a nash equilibrium all bidders 
must be bidding since the bidder ranked last matches the 
bid directly below him which is by default because there 
is no such bid but this is impossible consider the bidder 
ranked last the identity of this bidder is always clear given 
the deterministic tie-breaking rule this bidder can obtain 
the top spot and increase his revenue by γ −γk rk by 
bidding some and for small enough this is necessarily 
a profitable deviation hence there is no nash equilibrium 
in pure strategies 
on the other hand we find that in a second-price slot 
auction there can be a multitude of pure strategy nash 
equilibria the next two lemmas give conditions that characterize 
the allocations that can occur as a result of an equilibrium 
profile of bids given fixed agent values and revenues then 
if we can exhibit an allocation that satisfies these conditions 
there must exist at least one equilibrium we first consider 
the rbr case 
 
b¨orgers et al have proven this result in a model with 
three bidders and three slots and we generalize their 
argument edelman et al also point out this non-existence 
phenomenon they only illustrate the fact with an example 
because the result is quite immediate 
lemma given an allocation σ there exists a nash 
equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price rbr 
slot auction if and only if

rσ i ≤ rσ j 
for ≤ j ≤ n − and i ≥ j 
proof there exists a desired vector b which constitutes 
a nash equilibrium if and only if the following set of 
inequalities can be satisfied the variables are the πi and bj 
πi ≥ γj rσ i − bj ∀i ∀j i 
πi ≥ γj rσ i − bj ∀i ∀j i 
πi γi rσ i − bi ∀i 
bi ≥ bi ≤ i ≤ n − 
πi ≥ bi ≥ ∀i 
here rσ i is the revenue of the agent allocated slot i and 
πi and bi may be interpreted as this agent s surplus and 
declared revenue respectively we first argue that 
constraints can be removed because the inequalities above 
can be satisfied if and only if the inequalities without can 
be satisfied the necessary direction is immediate assume 
we have a vector π b which satisfies all inequalities above 
except then there is some i for which bi bi 
construct a new vector π b identical to the original except 
with bi bi we now have bi bi an agent in slot 
k i sees the price of slot i decrease from bi to bi bi 
but this does not make i more preferred than k to this agent 
because we have πk ≥ γi− rσ k − bi ≥ γi rσ k − bi 
γi rσ k −bi i e because the agent in slot k did not 
originally prefer slot i − at price bi he will not prefer slot i 
at price bi a similar argument applies for agents in slots 
k i the agent in slot i sees the price of this slot 
go down which only makes it more preferred finally the 
agent in slot i sees no change in the price of any slot so 
his slot remains most preferred hence inequalities - 
remain valid at π b we first make this change to the bi 
where bi bi and index i is smallest we then recursively 
apply the change until we eventually obtain a vector that 
satisfies all inequalities 
we safely ignore inequalities from now on by the 
farkas lemma the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if 
and only if there is no vector z such that

γj− zσ i j− ≤ ∀j 
x

zσ i j ≤ ∀i 
zσ i j ≥ ∀i ∀j i 
zσ i i free ∀i 
note that a variable of the form zσ i i appears at most once 
in a constraint of type so such a variable can never be 
positive also zσ i for all i by constraint 
since such variables never appear with another of the form 
zσ i i 
now if we wish to raise zσ i j above by one unit for j i 
we must lower zσ i i by one unit because of the constraint 
of type because γjrσ i ≤ γirσ i for i j raising 
 
zσ i j with i j while adjusting other variables to maintain 
feasibility cannot make the objective 
p 
i j γjrσ i zσ i j 
positive if this objective is positive then this is due to some 
component zσ i j with i j being positive 
now for the constraints of type if i j then zσ i j 
appears with zσ j− j− for j n so to raise the 
former variable γ− 
j units and maintain feasibility we must 
 i lower zσ i i by γ− 
j units and ii lower zσ j− j− by 
γ− 
j− units hence if the following inequalities hold 
rσ i ≤ 
„ 
γi

rσ i rσ j− 
for ≤ j ≤ n − and i j raising some zσ i j with 
i j cannot make the objective positive and there is no 
z that satisfies all inequalities above conversely if some 
inequality does not hold the objective can be made 
positive by raising the corresponding zσ i j and adjusting other 
variables so that feasibility is just maintained by a slight 
reindexing inequalities yield the statement of the 
theorem 
the rbb case is entirely analogous

proof sketch the proof technique is the same as in the 
previous lemma the desired nash equilibrium exists if and 
only if a related set of inequalities can be satisfied by the 
farkas lemma this occurs if and only if an alternate set of 
inequalities cannot be satisfied the conditions that 
determine whether the latter holds are given in the statement of 
the lemma 
the two lemmas above immediately lead to the following 
result 
theorem there always exists a complete information 
nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the second-price rbb 
slot auction there always exists an efficient complete 
information nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the 
secondprice rbr slot auction 
proof first consider rbb suppose agents are ranked 
according to their true values since xσ i ≤ xσ j for i j 
the system of inequalities in lemma is satisfied and the 
allocation is the result of some nash equilibrium bid profile 
by the same type of argument but appealing to lemma 
for rbr there exists a nash equilibrium bid profile such 
that bidders are ranked according to their true revenues 
by theorem this latter allocation is efficient 
this theorem establishes existence but not uniqueness 
indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple 
allocations and hence equilibria which satisfy the 
conditions of lemmas and in particular not all equilibria of 
a second-price rbr auction will be efficient for instance 
according to lemma with two agents and two slots any 
allocation can arise in a rbr equilibrium because no 
constraints apply 
theorems and taken together provide a possible 
explanation for yahoo s switch from first to second pricing 
we saw in section that this does not induce truthfulness 
from bidders with first pricing there will always be some 
bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid second pricing 
is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached 
and this reduces the cost of bid management 
 efficiency 
for a given allocation rule we call the allocation that 
would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully 
the standard allocation hence in the standard rbb 
allocation bidders are ranked by true values and in the standard 
rbr allocation they are ranked by true revenues 
according to lemmas and a ranking that results from a nash 
equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard 
allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or 
revenues switch places that is if ri rj then with rbr 
agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj ri is 
sufficiently large similarly for rbb this suggests that the 
value of an equilibrium allocation cannot differ too much 
from the value obtained in the standard allocation and the 
following theorems confirms this 
for an allocation σ of slots to agents we denote its 
total value by f σ

it may be the case that for some slot i we have σ i i 
and for slots k i we have σ k i we then say that 
slot i is inverted let s be the set of agents with indices at 
least i there are n − i of these if slot i is inverted it is 
occupied by some agent from s also all slots strictly lower 
than i must be occupied by the remaining agents from 
s since σ k i for k ≥ i the agent in slot i must 
then have an index σ i ≤ i note this means slot i 
cannot be inverted now there are two cases in the first

in the second case we have σ i i then since all agents 
in s except the one in slot i lie strictly below slot i and 
 
the agent in slot i is not agent i it must be that agent 
i is in a slot strictly below slot i this means that it is 
at least two slots below the agent that actually occupies slot

section the factor is l ≈ so the total value in a 
pure-strategy nash equilibrium of a second-price rbr slot

with such a discount 
again for rbb we have an analogous result 
theorem for an allocation σ that results from a 
purestrategy nash equilibrium of a second-price rbb slot 
auction we have g σ ≥ lg ηx 
proof sketch simply substitute bidder values for bidder 
revenues in the proof of theorem and appeal to lemma 
 conclusions 
this paper analyzed stylized versions of the slot auction 
designs currently used by yahoo and google namely rank 
by bid rbb and rank by revenue rbr respectively 
we also considered first and second pricing rules together 
with each of these allocation rules since both have been used 
historically we first studied the short-run setting with 
incomplete information corresponding to the case where 
agents have just approached the mechanism our 
equilibrium analysis revealed that rbb has much weaker 
informational requirements than rbr because bidders need not 
know any information about relevance even their own to 
play the bayes-nash equilibrium however rbr leads to 
an efficient allocation in equilibrium whereas rbb does not 
we showed that for an arbitrary distribution over value and 
relevance no revenue ranking of rbb and rbr is possible 
we hope that the tools we used to establish these results 
 revenue equivalence the form of first-price equilibria the 
truthful payments rules will help others wanting to pursue 
further analyses of slot auctions 
we also studied the long-run case where agents have 
experimented with their bids and each settled on one they 
find optimal we argued that a stable set of bids in this 
setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy nash equilibrium 
of the static game of complete information we showed that 
no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either rbb or rbr 
using first pricing but that with second pricing there always 
exists such an equilibrium in the case of rbr an efficient 
equilibrium in general second pricing allows for multiple 
pure-strategy equilibria but we showed that the value of 
such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the 
value obtained if all agents bid truthfully which in the case 
of rbr is the efficient value 
 future work 
introducing budget constraints into the model is a 
natural next step for future work the complication here lies 
in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns 
rather than single keywords assuming that the optimal 
choice of budget can be made independent of the choice 
of bid for a specific keyword it can be shown that it is a 
dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with one s 
bid the problem is then to ascertain that bids and budgets 
can indeed be optimized separately or to find a plausible 
model where deriving equilibrium bids and budgets together 
is tractable 
identifying a condition on the distribution over value and 
relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of rbb 
and rbr such as correlation between value and relevance 
perhaps would yield a more satisfactory characterization 
of their relative revenue properties placing bounds on the 
revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is 
also a relevant question 
because the incomplete information case is such a close 
generalization of the most basic single-item auction model 
it would be interesting to see which standard results from 
single-item auction theory e g results with risk-averse 
bidders an endogenous number of bidders asymmetries etc 
automatically generalize and which do not to fully 
understand the structural differences between single-item and slot 
auctions
