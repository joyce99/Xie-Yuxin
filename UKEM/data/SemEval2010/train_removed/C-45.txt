 introduction 
wireless sensor networks wsn have been envisioned 
to revolutionize the way humans perceive and interact with 
the surrounding environment one vision is to embed tiny 
sensor devices in outdoor environments by aerial 
deployments from unmanned air vehicles the sensor nodes form 
a network and collaborate to compensate for the extremely 
scarce resources available to each of them computational 
power memory size communication capabilities to 
accomplish the mission through collaboration redundancy and 
fault tolerance the wsn is then able to achieve 
unprecedented sensing capabilities 
a major step forward has been accomplished by 
developing systems for several domains military surveillance 
 habitat monitoring and structural monitoring 
even after these successes several research problems remain 
open among these open problems is sensor node 
localization i e how to find the physical position of each sensor 
node despite the attention the localization problem in wsn 
has received no universally acceptable solution has been 
developed there are several reasons for this on one hand 
localization schemes that use ranging are typically high end 
solutions gps ranging hardware consumes energy it is 
relatively expensive if high accuracy is required and poses 
form factor challenges that move us away from the vision 
of dust size sensor nodes ultrasound has a short range and 
is highly directional solutions that use the radio transceiver 
for ranging either have not produced encouraging results if 
the received signal strength indicator is used or are sensitive 
to environment e g multipath on the other hand 
localization schemes that only use the connectivity information 
for inferring location information are characterized by low 
accuracies ≈ ft in controlled environments − ft in 
realistic ones 
to address these challenges we propose a framework for 
wsn localization called stardust in which the 
complexity associated with the node localization is completely 
removed from the sensor node the basic principle of the 
framework is localization through passivity each sensor 
node is equipped with a corner-cube retro-reflector and 
possibly an optical filter a coloring device an aerial 
vehicle projects light onto the deployment area and records 
images containing retro-reflected light beams they appear as 
luminous spots through image processing techniques the 
locations of the retro-reflectors i e sensor nodes is 
deter 
mined for inferring the identity of the sensor node present 
at a particular location the stardust framework develops a 
constraint-based node id relaxation algorithm 
the main contributions of our work are the following we 
propose a novel framework for node localization in wsns 
that is very promising and allows for many future extensions 
and more accurate results we propose a constraint-based 
label relaxation algorithm for mapping node ids to the 
locations and four constraints node connectivity time and 
space which are building blocks for very accurate and very 
fast localization systems we develop a sensor node 
hardware prototype called a sensorball we evaluate the 
performance of a localization system for which we obtain location 
accuracies of − ft with a localization duration ranging 
from milliseconds to minutes we investigate the range 
of a system built on our framework by considering realities 
of physical phenomena that occurs during light propagation 
through the atmosphere 
the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 
is an overview of the state of art the design of the 
stardust framework is presented in section one 
implementation and its performance evaluation are in sections and 
 followed by a suite of system optimization techniques in 
section in section we present our conclusions 
 related work 
we present the prior work in localization in two major 
categories the range-based and the range-free schemes 
the range-based localization techniques have been 
designed to use either more expensive hardware and hence 
higher accuracy or just the radio transceiver ranging 
techniques dependent on hardware are the time-of-flight tof 
and the time-difference-of-arrival tdoa solutions that use 
the radio are based on the received signal strength indicator 
 rssi and more recently on radio interferometry 
the tof localization technique that is most widely used is 
the gps gps is a costly solution for a high accuracy 
localization of a large scale sensor network ahlos employs 
a tdoa ranging technique that requires extensive hardware 
and solves relatively large nonlinear systems of equations 
the cricket location-support system tdoa can achieve 
a location granularity of tens of inches with highly 
directional and short range ultrasound transceivers in the 
location of a sniper is determined in an urban terrain by 
using the tdoa between an acoustic wave and a radio beacon 
the pushpin project uses the tdoa between ultrasound 
pulses and light flashes for node localization the radar 
system uses the rssi to build a map of signal strengths 
as emitted by a set of beacon nodes a mobile node is 
located by the best match in the signal strength space with a 
previously acquired signature in mal a mobile node 
assists in measuring the distances acting as constraints 
between nodes until a rigid graph is generated the localization 
problem is formulated as an on-line state estimation in a 
nonlinear dynamic system a cooperative ranging that 
attempts to achieve a global positioning from distributed local 
optimizations is proposed in a very recent remarkable 
localization technique is based on radio interferometry rips 
 which utilizes two transmitters to create an interfering 
signal the frequencies of the emitters are very close to each 
other thus the interfering signal will have a low frequency 
envelope that can be easily measured the ranging technique 
performs very well the long time required for localization 
and multi-path environments pose significant challenges 
real environments create additional challenges for the 
range based localization schemes these have been 
emphasized by several studies to address these 
challenges and others hardware cost the energy expenditure 
the form factor the small range localization time several 
range-free localization schemes have been proposed sensor 
nodes use primarily connectivity information for inferring 
proximity to a set of anchors in the centroid localization 
scheme a sensor node localizes to the centroid of its 
proximate beacon nodes in apit each node decides its 
position based on the possibility of being inside or outside of 
a triangle formed by any three beacons within node s 
communication range the gradient algorithm leverages 
the knowledge about the network density to infer the average 
one hop length this in turn can be transformed into 
distances to nodes with known locations dv-hop uses the 
hop by hop propagation capability of the network to forward 
distances to landmarks more recently several localization 
schemes that exploit the sensing capabilities of sensor nodes 
have been proposed spotlight creates well controlled 
 in time and space events in the network while the sensor 
nodes detect and timestamp this events from the 
spatiotemporal knowledge for the created events and the temporal 
information provided by sensor nodes nodes spatial 
information can be obtained in a similar manner the lighthouse 
system uses a parallel light beam that is emitted by an 
anchor which rotates with a certain period a sensor node 
detects the light beam for a period of time which is 
dependent on the distance between it and the light emitting device 
many of the above localization solutions target specific 
sets of requirements and are useful for specific applications 
stardust differs in that it addresses a particular demanding 
set of requirements that are not yet solved well stardust is 
meant for localizing air dropped nodes where node 
passiveness high accuracy low cost small form factor and rapid 
localization are all required many military applications have 
such requirements 
 stardust system design 
the design of the stardust system and its name was 
inspired by the similarity between a deployed sensor network 
in which sensor nodes indicate their presence by emitting 
light and the universe consisting of luminous and 
illuminated objects stars galaxies planets etc 
the main difficulty when applying the above ideas to the 
real world is the complexity of the hardware that needs to 
be put on a sensor node so that the emitted light can be 
detected from thousands of feet the energy expenditure for 
producing an intense enough light beam is also prohibitive 
instead what we propose to use for sensor node 
localization is a passive optical element called a retro-reflector 
the most common retro-reflective optical component is a 
corner-cube retroreflector ccr shown in figure a it 
consists of three mutually perpendicular mirrors the 
inter 
 a b 
figure corner-cube retroreflector a and an array of 
ccrs molded in plastic b 
esting property of this optical component is that an incoming 
beam of light is reflected back towards the source of the 
light irrespective of the angle of incidence this is in 
contrast with a mirror which needs to be precisely positioned to 
be perpendicular to the incident light a very common and 
inexpensive implementation of an array of ccrs is the 
retroreflective plastic material used on cars and bicycles for night 
time detection shown in figure b 
in the stardust system each node is equipped with a 
small e g in array of ccrs and the enclosure has 
self-righting capabilities that orient the array of ccrs 
predominantly upwards it is critical to understand that the 
upward orientation does not need to be exact even when large 
angular variations from a perfectly upward orientation are 
present a ccr will return the light in the exact same 
direction from which it came 
in the remaining part of the section we present the 
architecture of the stardust system and the design of its main 
components 
 system architecture 
the envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as 
follows 
 the sensor nodes are released possibly in a controlled 
manner from an aerial vehicle during the night 
 the aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and 
uses a strobe light to illuminate it the sensor nodes 
equipped with ccrs and optical filters acting as 
coloring devices have self-righting capabilities and 
retroreflect the incoming strobe light the retro-reflected 
light is either white as the originating source light 
or colored due to optical filters 
 the aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images 
very close in time msec level one image is taken 
when the strobe light is on the other when the strobe 
light is off the acquired images are used for obtaining 
the locations of sensor nodes which appear as luminous 
spots in the image 
 the aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node ids to 
the identified locations in one of the following ways a 
by using the color of a retro-reflected light if a sensor 
node has a unique color b by requiring sensor nodes 
to establish neighborhood information and report it to 
a base station c by controlling the time sequence of 
sensor nodes deployment and recording additional

 the computed locations are disseminated to the sensor 
network 
the architecture of the stardust system is shown in 
figure the architecture consists of two main components 
the first is centralized and it is located on a more powerful 
device the second is distributed and it resides on all 
sensor nodes the central device consists of the following the 
light emitter the image processing module the node id 
mapping module and the radio model the distributed 
component of the architecture is the transfer function which 
acts as a filter for the incoming light the aforementioned 
modules are briefly described below 
 light emitter - it is a strobe light capable of producing 
very intense collimated light pulses the emitted light 
is non-monochromatic unlike a laser and it is 
characterized by a spectral density ψ λ a function of the 
wavelength the emitted light is incident on the ccrs 
present on sensor nodes 
 transfer function φ ψ λ - this is a bandpass filter 
for the incident light on the ccr the filter allows a 
portion of the original spectrum to be retro-reflected 
from here on we will refer to the transfer function as 
the color of a sensor node 
 image processing - the image processing module 
acquires high resolution images from these images the 
locations and the colors of sensor nodes are obtained 
if only one set of pictures can be taken i e one 
location of the light emitter image analysis device then the 
map of the field is assumed to be known as well as the 
distance between the imaging device and the field the 
aforementioned assumptions field map and distance to 
it are not necessary if the images can be simultaneously 
taken from different locations it is important to remark 
here that the identity of a node can not be directly 
obtained through image processing alone unless a 
specific characteristic of a sensor node can be identified in 
the image 
 node id matching - this module uses the detected 
locations and through additional techniques e g sensor 
node coloring and connectivity information g λ e 
from the deployed network to uniquely identify the 
sensor nodes observed in the image the connectivity 
information is represented by neighbor tables sent from 
 
algorithm image processing 
 background filtering 
 retro-reflected light recognition through intensity 
filtering 
 edge detection to obtain the location of sensor nodes 
 color identification for each detected sensor node 
each sensor node to the central device 
 radio model - this component provides an estimate of 
the radio range to the node id matching module it 
is only used by node id matching techniques that are 
based on the radio connectivity in the network the 
estimate of the radio range r is based on the sensor node 
density obtained through the image processing 
module and the connectivity information i e g λ e 
the two main components of the stardust architecture 
are the image processing and the node id mapping their 
design and analysis is presented in the sections that follow 
 image processing 
the goal of the image processing algorithm ipa is to 
identify the location of the nodes and their color note that 
ipa does not identify which node fell where but only what 
is the set of locations where the nodes fell 
ipa is executed after an aerial vehicle records two 
pictures one in which the field of deployment is illuminated and 
one when no illuminations is present let pdark be the 
picture of the deployment area taken when no light was emitted 
and plight be the picture of the same deployment area when a 
strong light beam was directed towards the sensor nodes 
the proposed ipa has several steps as shown in 
algorithm the first step is to obtain a third picture pfilter where 
only the differences between pdark and plight remain let us 
assume that pdark has a resolution of n × m where n is the 
number of pixels in a row of the picture while m is the 
number of pixels in a column of the picture then pdark is 
composed of n × m pixels noted pdark i j i ∈ ≤ i ≤ n ≤ 
j ≤ m similarly plight is composed of n × m pixels noted 
plight i j ≤ i ≤ n ≤ j ≤ m 
each pixel p is described by an rgb value where the r 
value is denoted by pr the g value is denoted by pg and 
the b value is denoted by pb ipa then generates the third 
picture pfilter through the following transformations 
pr 
filter i j pr 
light i j −pr 
dark i j 
pg 
filter i j pg 
light i j −pg 
dark i j 
pb 
filter i j pb 
light i j −pb 
dark i j 
 
after this transformation all the features that appeared in 
both pdark and plight are removed from pfilter this simplifies 
the recognition of light retro-reflected by sensor nodes 
the second step consists of identifying the elements 
contained in pfilter that retro-reflect light for this an intensity 
filter is applied to pfilter first ipa converts pfilter into a 
grayscale picture then the brightest pixels are identified and 
used to create preflect this step is eased by the fact that the 
reflecting nodes should appear much brighter than any other 
illuminated object in the picture

the third step runs an edge detection algorithm on preflect 
to identify the boundary of the nodes present a tool such as 
matlab provides a number of edge detection techniques we 
used the bwboundaries function for the obtained edges the 
location x y in the image of each node is determined by 
computing the centroid of the points constituting its edges 
standard computer graphics techniques are then used 
to transform the d locations of sensor nodes detected in 
multiple images into d sensor node locations the color of 
the node is obtained as the color of the pixel located at x y 
in plight 
 node id matching 
the goal of the node id matching module is to 
obtain the identity node id of a luminous spot in the 
image detected to be a sensor node for this we define v 
 x y x y xm ym to be the set of locations of 
the sensor nodes as detected by the image processing 
module and λ λ λ λm to be the set of unique node ids 
assigned to the m sensor nodes before deployment from 
here on we refer to node ids as labels 
we model the problem of finding the label λj of a node ni 
as a probabilistic label relaxation problem frequently used 
in image processing understanding in the image processing 
domain scene labeling i e identifying objects in an 
image plays a major role the goal of scene labeling is to 
assign a label to each object detected in an image such that 
an appropriate image interpretation is achieved it is 
prohibitively expensive to consider the interactions among all 
the objects in an image instead constraints placed among 
nearby objects generate local consistencies and through 
iteration global consistencies can be obtained 
the main idea of the sensor node localization through 
probabilistic label relaxation is to iteratively compute the 
probability of each label being the correct label for a 
sensor node by taking into account at each iteration the 
support for a label the support for a label can be understood 
as a hint or proof that a particular label is more likely to be 
the correct one when compared with the other potential 
labels for a sensor node we pictorially depict this main idea 
in figure as shown node ni has a set of candidate 
labels λ λk each of the labels has a different value 
for the support function q λk we defer the explanation 
of how the support function is implemented until the 
subsections that follow where we provide four concrete 
techniques formally the algorithm is outlined in algorithm 
where the equations necessary for computing the new 
probability pni λk for a label λk of a node ni are expressed by the 
 
algorithm label relaxation

the label relaxation algorithm is iterative and it is 
polynomial in the size of the network number of nodes the 
pseudo-code is shown in algorithm it initializes the 
probabilities associated with each possible label for a node ni 
through a uniform distribution at each iteration s the 
algorithm updates the probability associated with each label by 
considering the support qs 
ni 
 λk for each candidate label of 
a sensor node 
in the sections that follow we describe four different 
techniques for implementing the support function based on 
node coloring radio connectivity the time of deployment 
 time and the location of deployment space while some 
of these techniques are simplistic they are primitives which 
when combined can create powerful localization systems 
these design techniques have different trade-offs which we 
will present in section 
 relaxation with color constraints 
the unique mapping between a sensor node s position 
 identified by the image processing and a label can be 
obtained by assigning a unique color to each sensor node for 
this we define c c c cn to be the set of unique 
colors available and m λ → c to be a one-to-one mapping of 
labels to colors this mapping is known prior to the sensor 
node deployment from node manufacturing 
in the case of color constrained label relaxation the 
support for label λk is expressed as follows 
qs 
ni 
 λk 
as a result the label relaxation algorithm algorithm 
consists of the following steps one label is assigned to each 
sensor node lines - of the algorithm implicitly having 
a probability pni λk the algorithm executes a single 
iteration when the support function simply reiterates the 
confidence in the unique labeling 
however it is often the case that unique colors for each 
node will not be available it is interesting to discuss here the 
influence that the size of the coloring space i e c has on 
the accuracy of the localization algorithm several cases are 
discussed below 
 if c no colors are used and the sensor nodes are 
equipped with simple ccrs that reflect back all the 
incoming light i e no filtering and no coloring of the 
incoming light from the image processing system the 
position of sensor nodes can still be obtained since 
all nodes appear white no single sensor node can be 
uniquely identified 
 if c m − then there are enough unique colors for 
all nodes one node remains white i e no coloring the 
problem is trivially solved each node can be identified 
based on its unique color this is the scenario for the 
relaxation with color constraints 
 if c ≥ there are several options for how to 
partition the coloring space if c c one possibility is 
to assign the color c to a single node and leave the 
remaining m− sensor nodes white or to assign the color 
c to more than one sensor node one can observe that 
once a color is assigned uniquely to a sensor node in 
effect that sensor node is given the status of anchor 
or node with known location 
it is interesting to observe that there is an entire spectrum 
of possibilities for how to partition the set of sensor nodes 
in equivalence classes where an equivalence class is 
represented by one color in order to maximize the success of the 
localization algorithm one of the goals of this paper is to 
understand how the size of the coloring space and its 
partitioning affect localization accuracy 
despite the simplicity of this method of constraining the 
set of labels that can be assigned to a node we will show that 
this technique is very powerful when combined with other 
relaxation techniques 
 relaxation with connectivity constraints 
connectivity information obtained from the sensor 
network through beaconing can provide additional information 
for locating sensor nodes in order to gather connectivity 
information the following need to occur after deployment 
through beaconing of hello messages sensor nodes build 
their neighborhood tables each node sends its neighbor 
table information to the central device via a base station 
first let us define g λ e to be the weighted 
connectivity graph built by the central device from the received 
neighbor table information in g the edge λi λj has a

and received by λi in addition let r be the radio range of 
the sensor nodes 
the main idea of the connectivity constrained label 
relaxation is depicted in figure in which two nodes ni and 
nj have been assigned all possible labels the confidence in 
each of the candidate labels for a sensor node is represented 
by a probability shown in a dotted rectangle 
it is important to remark that through beaconing and the 
reporting of neighbor tables to the central device a global 
view of all constraints in the network can be obtained it 
is critical to observe that these constraints are among labels 
as shown in figure two constraints exist between nodes ni 
and nj the constraints are depicted by gi j and gi jm the 
number of beacons sent the labels λj and λjm and received 
by the label λi

as a result the localization algorithm algorithm 
consists of the following steps all labels are assigned to each 
sensor node lines - of the algorithm and implicitly each 
label has a probability initialized to pni λk λ in each 
iteration the probabilities for the labels of a sensor node are 
updated when considering the interaction with the labels of 
sensor nodes within r it is important to remark that the 
identity of the nodes within r is not known only the candidate 
labels and their probabilities the relaxation algorithm 
converges when during an iteration the probability of no label 
is updated by more than ε 
the label relaxation algorithm based on connectivity 
constraints enforces such constraints between pairs of sensor 
nodes for a large scale sensor network deployment it is not 
feasible to consider all pairs of sensor nodes in the network 
hence the algorithm should only consider pairs of sensor 
nodes that are within a reasonable communication range r 
we assume a circular radio range and a symmetric 
connectivity in the remaining part of the section we propose a 
simple analytical model that estimates the radio range r for 
medium-connected networks less than neighbors per r 
we consider the following to be known the size of the 
deployment field l the number of sensor nodes deployed n

we investigate the accuracy of our model in section 
 relaxation with time constraints 
time constraints can be treated similarly with color 
constraints the unique identification of a sensor node can be 
obtained by deploying sensor nodes individually one by one 
and recording a sequence of images the sensor node that is 
identified as new in the last picture it was not identified in 
the picture before last must be the last sensor node dropped 
in a similar manner with color constrained label 
relaxation the time constrained approach is very simple but may 
take too long especially for large scale systems while it 
can be used in practice it is unlikely that only a time 
constrained label relaxation is used as we will see by 
combining constrained-based primitives realistic localization 
systems can be implemented 
the support function for the label relaxation with time 
constraints is defined identically with the color constrained 
relaxation

when the support function simply reiterates the confidence

 relaxation with space constraints 
spatial information related to sensor deployment can also 
be employed as another input to the label relaxation 
algorithm to do that we use two types of locations the node 
location pn and the label location pl the former pn is defined 
as the position of nodes xn yn zn after deployment which 
can be obtained through image processing as mentioned in 
section the latter pl is defined as the location xl yl zl 
where a node is dropped we use dni

horizontal distance between the location of the label λm and the 
location of the node ni clearly dni 
λm 
 xn −xl yn −yl 
at the time of a sensor node release the one-to-one 
mapping between the node and its label is known in other words 
the label location is the same as the node location at the 
release time after release the label location information is 
partially lost due to the random factors such as wind and 
surface impact however statistically the node locations are 
correlated with label locations such correlation depends on 
the airdrop methods employed and environments for the 
sake of simplicity let s assume nodes are dropped from the 
air through a helicopter hovering in the air wind can be 
decomposed into three components x y and z only x and 
y affect the horizontal distance a node can travel 
according to we can assume that x and y follow an 
independent normal distribution therefore the absolute value of 
the wind speed follows a rayleigh distribution obviously 
the higher the wind speed is the further a node would land 
away horizontally from the label location if we assume that 
the distance d is a function of the wind speed v 
we can obtain the probability distribution of d under a given 
wind speed distribution without loss of generality we 
assume that d is proportional to the wind speed therefore 
d follows the rayleigh distribution as well as shown in 
figure the spatial-based relaxation is a recursive process 
to assign the probability that a nodes has a certain label by 
using the distances between the location of a node with 
multiple label locations 
we note that the distribution of distance d affects the 
probability with which a label is assigned it is not 
necessarily true that the nearest label is always chosen for example 
if d follows the rayleigh σ distribution we can obtain the 
probability density function pdf of distances as shown 
in figure this figure indicates that the possibility of a 
node to fall vertically is very small under windy conditions 
 σ and that the distance d is affected by the σ the 
spatial distribution of nodes for σ is shown in figure 
strong wind with a high σ value leads to a larger node 
dispersion more formally given a probability density function 
pdf d the support for label λk of sensor node ni can be 
formulated as 
qs 
ni 
 λk pdf dni 
λk 
 
it is interesting to point out two special cases first if all 
nodes are released at once i e only one label location for 
all released nodes the distance d from a node to all labels 
is the same in this case ps 
ni 
 λk ps 
ni 
 λk which indicates 
that we can not use the spatial-based relaxation to recursively 
narrow down the potential labels for a node second if nodes 
are released at different locations that are far away from each 
other we have i if node ni has label λk ps 
ni 
 λk → when 
s → ∞ ii if node ni does not have label λk ps 
ni 
 λk → 
when s → ∞ in this second scenario there are multiple 
labels one label per release hence it is possible to correlate 
release times labels with positions on the ground these 
results indicate that spatial-based relaxation can label the node 
with a very high probability if the physical separation among 
nodes is large 
 relaxation with color and connectivity 
constraints 
one of the most interesting features of the stardust 
architecture is that it allows for hybrid localization solutions to be 
built depending on the system requirements one example 
is a localization system that uses the color and connectivity 
constraints in this scheme the color constraints are used for 
reducing the number of candidate labels for sensor nodes 
to a more manageable value as a reminder in the 
connectivity constrained relaxation all labels are candidate labels 
for each sensor node the color constraints are used in the 
initialization phase of algorithm lines - after the 
initialization the standard connectivity constrained relaxation 
algorithm is used 
for a better understanding of how the label relaxation 
algorithm works we give a concrete example exemplified in 
figure in part a of the figure we depict the data structures

g λ e as seen the potential labels shown inside the 
vertical rectangles are assigned to each node node ni can be

initialization all probabilities are equal 
part b of figure shows the result of the first iteration 
of the localization algorithm for node ni assuming that node 
nj is the first wi chosen in line of algorithm by using 
equation the algorithm computes the support q λi for 
each of the possible labels for node ni once the q λi s 
are computed the normalizing constant given by equation 
 can be obtained the last step of the iteration is to update 
the probabilities associated with all potential labels of node 
ni as given by equation 
one interesting problem which we explore in the 
performance evaluation section is to assess the impact the 
partitioning of the color set c has on the accuracy of 
localization when the size of the coloring set is smaller than the 
number of sensor nodes as it is the case for our hybrid 
connectivity color constrained relaxation the system designer 
has the option of allowing one node to uniquely have a color 
 acting as an anchor or multiple nodes intuitively by 
assigning one color to more than one node more constraints 
 distributed can be enforced 
 relaxation techniques analysis 
the proposed label relaxation techniques have different 
trade-offs for our analysis of the trade-offs we consider 
the following metrics of interest the localization time 
 duration the energy consumed overhead the network size 
 scale that can be handled by the technique and the 
localization accuracy the parameters of interest are the following 
the number of sensor nodes n the energy spent for one 
aerial drop εd the energy spent in the network for 
collecting and reporting neighbor information εb and the time td 
taken by a sensor node to reach the ground after being 
aerially deployed the cost comparison of the different label 
relaxation techniques is shown in table 
as shown the relaxation techniques based on color and 
space constraints have the lowest localization duration zero 
for all practical purposes the scalability of the color based 
relaxation technique is however limited to the number of 
 a b 
figure sensorball with self-righting capabilities a 
and colored ccrs b 
unique color filters that can be built the narrower the 
transfer function ψ λ the larger the number of unique colors 
that can be created the manufacturing costs however are 
increasing as well the scalability issue is addressed by all 
other label relaxation techniques most notably the time

 system implementation 
the stardust localization framework depicted in figure 
 is flexible in that it enables the development of new 
localization systems based on the four proposed label 
relaxation schemes or the inclusion of other yet to be invented 
schemes for our performance evaluation we implemented a 
version of the stardust framework namely the one proposed 
in section where the constraints are based on color and 
connectivity 
the central device of the stardust system consists of the 
following the light emitter - we used a 
common-off-theshelf flash light qbeam million candlepower the 
image acquisition was done with a megapixel digital camera 
 sony dsc-s which provided the input to the image 
processing algorithm implemented in matlab 
for sensor nodes we built a custom sensor node called 
sensorball with self-righting capabilities shown in figure 
 a the self-righting capabilities are necessary in order to 
orient the ccr predominantly upwards the ccrs that we 
used were inexpensive plastic molded night time warning 
signs commonly available on bicycles as shown in figure 
 b we remark here the low quality of the ccrs we used 
the reflectivity of each ccr there are tens molded in the 
plastic container is extremely low and each ccr is not built 
with mirrors a reflective effect is achieved by employing 
finely polished plastic surfaces we had colors available 
in addition to the standard ccr which reflects all the 
incoming light white ccr for a slightly higher price ours 
were cents piece better quality ccrs can be employed 
 
figure the field in the dark figure the illuminated field figure the difference figure 
 figure 
higher quality better mirrors would translate in more 
accurate image processing better sensor node detection and 
smaller form factor for the optical component an array of 
ccrs with a smaller area can be used 
the sensor node platform we used was the micaz mote 
the code that runs on each node is a simple application 
which broadcasts beacons and maintains a neighbor 
table containing the percentage of successfully received 
beacons for each neighbor on demand the neighbor table is 
reported to a base station where the node id mapping is 
performed 
 system evaluation 
in this section we present the performance evaluation of 
a system implementation of the stardust localization 
framework the three major research questions that our evaluation 
tries to answer are the feasibility of the proposed framework 
 can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances 
the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the 
stardust framework and whether or not atmospheric 
conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an 
image the first two questions are investigated by evaluating 
the two main components of the stardust framework the 
image processing and the node id matching these 
components have been evaluated separately mainly because of 
lack of adequate facilities we wanted to evaluate the 
performance of the image processing algorithm in a long range 
realistic experimental set-up while the node id matching 
required a relatively large area available for long periods of 
time for connectivity data gathering the third research 
question is investigated through a computer modeling of 
atmospheric phenomena 
for the evaluation of the image processing module we 
performed experiments in a football stadium where we 
deploy sensor nodes in a × grid the distance between the 
central device and the sensor nodes is approximately ft 
the metrics of interest are the number of false positives and 
false negatives in the image processing algorithm 
for the evaluation of the node id mapping component 
we deploy sensor nodes in an × ft flat area of 
a stadium in order to investigate the influence the radio 
connectivity has on localization accuracy we vary the height 
above ground of the deployed sensor nodes two set-ups are 
used one in which the sensor nodes are on the ground and 
the second one in which the sensor nodes are raised inches 
above ground from here on we will refer to these two 
experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high 
connectivity networks respectively because when nodes are 
on the ground the communication range is low resulting in 
less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a 
greater communication range the metrics of interest are 
the localization error defined as the distance between the 
computed location and the true location - known from the 
manual placement the percentage of nodes correctly 
localized the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm the 
time to localize and the robustness of the node id mapping 
to errors in the image processing module 
the parameters that we vary experimentally are the 
angle under which images are taken the focus of the camera 
and the degree of connectivity the parameters that we vary 
in simulations subsequent to image acquisition and 
connectivity collection the number of colors the number of 
anchors the number of false positives or negatives as input 
to the node id matching component the distance between 
the imaging device and sensor network i e range 
atmospheric conditions light attenuation coefficient and ccr 
reflectance indicative of its quality 
 image processing 
for the ipa evaluation we deploy sensor nodes in a 
 × grid we take sets of pictures using different 
orientations of the camera and different zooming factors all 
pictures were taken from the same location each set is 
composed of a picture taken in the dark and of a picture taken 
with a light beam pointed at the nodes we process the 
pictures offline using a matlab implementation of ipa since we 
are interested in the feasibility of identifying colored sensor 
nodes at large distance the end result of our ipa is the d 
location of sensor nodes position in the image the 
transformation to d coordinates can be done through standard 
computer graphics techniques 
one set of pictures obtained as part of our experiment is 
shown in figures and the execution of our ipa 
algorithm results in figure which filters out the background 
and figure which shows the output of the edge detection 
step of ipa the experimental results are depicted in

of false positives the ipa determines that there is a node

about of the cases we obtained perfect results i e no 
false positives and no false negatives in the remaining cases 
we obtained a number of false positives of at most one and 
a number of false negatives of at most two 
we exclude two pairs of pictures from figure in the 
first excluded pair we obtain false positives and in the 
second pair false positives and false negatives by 
carefully examining the pictures we realized that the first pair 
was taken out of focus and that a car temporarily appeared 
in one of the pictures of the second pair the anomaly in 
the second set was due to the fact that we waited too long to 
take the second picture if the pictures had been taken a few 
milliseconds apart the car would have been represented on 
either both or none of the pictures and the ipa would have 
filtered it out 
 node id matching 
we evaluate the node id matching component of our 
system by collecting empirical data connectivity information 
from the outdoor deployment of nodes in the × ft 
area we collect sets of data for the high connectivity 
and low connectivity network deployments off-line we 
investigate the influence of coloring on the metrics of interest 
by randomly assigning colors to the sensor nodes for one 
experimental data set we generate random assignments 
of colors to sensor nodes it is important to observe that for 
the evaluation of the node id matching algorithm color and 
connectivity constrained we simulate the color assignment 
to sensor nodes as mentioned in section the size of the 
coloring space available to us was colors through 
simulations of color assignment not connectivity we are able 
to investigate the influence that the size of the coloring space 
has on the accuracy of localization the value of the

here represent averages over the randomly generated 
colorings and over all experimental data sets 
we first investigate the accuracy of our proposed radio 
model and subsequently use the derived values for the radio 
range in the evaluation of the node id matching component 
 radio model 
from experiments we obtain the average number of 
observed beacons k defined in section for the low 
connectivity network of beacons and for the high 
connectivity network of beacons from our radio model 
 equation we obtain a radio range r ft for the low 
connectivity network and r ft for the high connectivity 
network 
to estimate the accuracy of our simple model we plot 
the number of radio links that exist in the networks and the 
number of links that are missing as functions of the distance 
between nodes the results are shown in figures and 
we define the average radio range r to be the distance over 
which less than of potential radio links are missing 
as shown in figure the radio range is between ft and 
 ft for the higher connectivity network the radio range 
was between ft and ft 
we choose two conservative estimates of the radio range 
 ft for the low connectivity case and ft for the high 
connectivity case which are in good agreement with the values 
predicted by our radio model 
 localization error vs coloring space size 
in this experiment we investigate the effect of the number 
of colors on the localization accuracy for this we randomly 
assign colors from a pool of a given size to the sensor nodes

we then execute the localization algorithm which uses the

ranges and ft to investigate its influence on the 
localization error 
the results are depicted in figure localization error 
and figure percentage of nodes correctly localized as 
shown for an estimate of ft for the radio range as 
predicted by our radio model we obtain the smallest 
localization errors as small as ft when enough colors are used 
both figures and confirm our intuition that a larger 
number of colors available significantly decrease the error in 
localization 
the well known fact that relaxation algorithms do not 
always converge was observed during our experiments the 
percentage of successful runs when the algorithm 
converged is depicted in figure as shown in several 
situations the algorithm failed to converge the algorithm 
execution was stopped after iterations per node if the 
algorithm does not converge in a predetermined number of steps 
it will terminate and the label with the highest probability 
will provide the identity of the node it is very probable that 
the chosen label is incorrect since the probabilities of some 
of labels are constantly changing with each iteration the 
convergence of relaxation based algorithms is a well known 
issue 
 localization error vs color uniqueness 
as mentioned in the section a unique color gives a 
sensor node the statute of an anchor a sensor node that is 
an anchor can unequivocally be identified through the image 
processing module in this section we investigate the effect 
unique colors have on the localization accuracy specifically 
we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning 
more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy 
by enforcing more constraints as opposed to uniquely 
assigning a color to a single node

figure localization error vs number of colors 
for this we fix the number of available colors to either 
 or and vary the number of nodes that are given unique 
colors from up to the maximum number of colors or 
 naturally if we have a maximum number of colors of 
we can assign at most anchors the experimental results 
are depicted in figure localization error and figure 
 percentage of sensor node correctly localized as expected 
the localization accuracy increases with the increase in the 
number of colors available larger coloring space also for 
a given size of the coloring space e g colors available if 
more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the 
localization accuracy decreases it is interesting to observe 
that by assigning colors uniquely to nodes the benefit of 
having additional colors is diminished specifically if colors 
are available and all are assigned uniquely the system would 
be less accurately localized error ≈ ft when compared 
to the case of colors and no unique assignments of colors 
 ≈ ft localization error 
the same trend of a less accurate localization can be 
observed in figure which shows the percentage of nodes 
correctly localized i e ft localization error as shown if 
we increase the number of colors that are uniquely assigned 
the percentage of nodes correctly localized decreases 
 localization error vs connectivity 
we collected empirical data for two network deployments 
with different degrees of connectivity high and low in 
order to assess the influence of connectivity on location 
accuracy the results obtained from running our localization 
algorithm are depicted in figure and figure we 
varied the number of colors available and assigned no anchors 
 i e no unique assignments of colors 
in both scenarios as expected localization error decrease 
with an increase in the number of colors it is interesting 
to observe however that the low connectivity scenario

network both scenarios low and high connectivity have 
comparable localization errors of less that ft the same trend 
of more accurate location information is evidenced by 
figure which shows that the percentage of nodes that are 
localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity 
deployment 
 localization error vs image processing 
errors 
so far we investigated the sources for error in 
localization that are intrinsic to the node id matching component 
as previously presented luminous objects can be 
mistakenly detected to be sensor nodes during the location 
detection phase of the image processing module these false 
positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure 
of the image processing module more problematic are false 
negatives when a sensor node does not reflect back enough 
light to be detected they need to be handled by the 
localization algorithm in this case the localization algorithm 
is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes that 
need to be matched one coming from the image processing 
 which misses some nodes and one coming from the 
network with the connectivity information here we assume a 
fully connected network so that all sensor nodes report their 
connectivity information in this experiment we investigate 
how image processing errors false negatives influence the 
localization accuracy 
for this evaluation we ran our localization algorithm with 
empirical data but dropped a percentage of nodes from the 
list of nodes detected by the image processing algorithm we 
artificially introduced false negatives in the image 
process

figure impact of false negatives on the localization 
error 
ing the effect of false negatives on localization accuracy is 
depicted in figure as seen in the figure if the number of 
false negatives is the error in position estimation 
doubles when colors are available it is interesting to observe 
that the scenario when more colors are available e g 
colors is being affected more drastically than the scenario with 
less colors e g colors the benefit of having more colors 
available is still being maintained at least for the range of 
colors we investigated through colors 
 localization time 
in this section we look more closely at the duration for 
each of the four proposed relaxation techniques and two 
combinations of them color-connectivity and color-time 
we assume that unique color filters can be manufactured 
that the sensor network is deployed from ft 
 necessary for the time-constrained relaxation and that the time 
required for reporting connectivity grows linearly with an 
initial reporting period of sec as used in a real world 
tracking application the localization duration results as 
presented in table are depicted in figure 
as shown for all practical purposes the time required 
by the space constrained relaxation techniques is sec the 
same applies to the color constrained relaxation for which 
the localization time is sec if the number of colors is 
sufficient considering our assumptions only for a network of 
size the color constrained relaxation works the 
localization duration for all other network sizes and 
is infinite i e unique color assignments to sensor nodes 
can not be made since only colors are unique when 
only color constrained relaxation is used both the 
connectivity constrained and time constrained techniques increase 
linearly with the network size for the time constrained the 
central device deploys sensor nodes one by one recording 
an image after the time a sensor node is expected to reach the

it is interesting to notice in figure the improvement in 
the localization time obtained by simply combining the color 
and the connectivity constrained techniques the 
localization duration in this case is identical with the connectivity 
constrained technique 
the combination of color and time constrained 
relaxations is even more interesting for a reasonable 
localization duration of seconds a perfect i e ft localization 
error localization system can be built in this scenario the 
set of sensor nodes is split in batches with each batch 
having a set of unique colors it would be very interesting to 
consider other scenarios where the strength of the space 
constrained relaxation sec for any sensor network size is 
used for improving the other proposed relaxation techniques 
we leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such 
technique combination for future work 
 system range 
in this section we evaluate the feasibility of the 
stardust localization framework when considering the realities 
of light propagation through the atmosphere 
the main factor that determines the range of our system is 
light scattering which redirects the luminance of the source 
into the medium in essence equally affecting the luminosity 
of the target and of the background scattering limits the 
visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between 
the target and its background approaches zero as the 
distance increases the apparent contrast cr is quantitatively 
expressed by the formula 
cr nt 
r −nb 
r nb 
r 
where nt 
r and nb 
r are the apparent target radiance and 
apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source 
respectively the apparent radiance nt 
r of a target at a 
distance r from the light source is given by 
nt 
r na 
iρte− σr 
πr 
 
where i is the intensity of the light source ρt is the 
target reflectance σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient ≈ 
 km− and ≈ km− for a clear and a hazy 
atmosphere respectively and na is the radiance of the 
atmospheric backscatter and it can be expressed as follows 
na 
gσ i 
 π 
 σrz 
 σr 
e−x 
x 
dx 
where g is a backscatter gain the apparent 
background radiance nb 
r is given by formulas similar with 
equations and where only the target reflectance ρt is 
substituted with the background reflectance ρb it is important 
to remark that when cr reaches its lower limit no increase 
in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase 
the range of the system from equations and it can be 
observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can 
influence the range of the system is ρt the target reflectance 
figures and depict the apparent contrast cr as a 
function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy 
atmosphere respectively the apparent contrast is investigated for 
reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from to perfect 
reflector for a contrast c of at least as it can be seen in 
figure a range of approximately ft can be achieved 
if the atmosphere is clear the performance dramatically 
deteriorates when the atmospheric conditions are problematic 
as shown in figure a range of up to ft is 
achievable when using highly reflective ccr components 
while our light source million candlepower was 
sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet we remark that there 
exist commercially available light sources million 
candlepower or military million candlepower 
powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet 
 stardust system optimizations 
in this section we describe extensions of the proposed 
architecture that can constitute future research directions 
 chained constraint primitives 
in this paper we proposed four primitives for 
constraintbased relaxation algorithms color connectivity time and 
space to demonstrate the power that can be obtained by 
combining them we proposed and evaluated one 
combination of such primitives color and connectivity an 
interesting research direction to pursue could be to chain more than 
two of these primitives an example of such chain is color 
temporal spatial and connectivity other research directions 
could be to use voting scheme for deciding which primitive 
to use or assign different weights to different relaxation 
algorithms 
 
 location learning 
if after several iterations of the algorithm none of the 
label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value the 
confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low it 
would be interesting to associate with a node more than one 
label implicitly more than one location and defer the label 
assignment decision until events are detected in the network 
 if the network was deployed for target tracking 
 localization in rugged environments 
the initial driving force for the stardust localization 
framework was to address the sensor node localization in 
extremely rugged environments canopies dense vegetation 
extremely obstructing environments pose significant 
challenges for sensor nodes localization the hope and our 
original idea was to consider the time period between the aerial 
deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears 
under the canopy by recording the last visible position of a 
sensor node as seen from the aircraft a reasonable estimate 
of the sensor node location can be obtained this would 
require that sensor nodes posses self-righting capabilities 
while in mid-air nevertheless we remark on the suitability 
of our localization framework for rugged non-line-of-sight 
environments 
 conclusions 
stardust solves the localization problem for aerial 
deployments where passiveness low cost small form factor 
and rapid localization are required results show that 
accuracy can be within ft and localization time within 
milliseconds stardust also shows robustness with respect to errors 
we predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have 
on the range of a system based on the stardust framework 
and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose 
significant challenges 
most importantly the properties of stardust support 
the potential for even more accurate localization solutions 
as well as solutions for rugged non-line-of-sight 
environments
