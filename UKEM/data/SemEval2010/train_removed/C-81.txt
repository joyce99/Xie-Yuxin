abstract 
harvesting energy from the environment is feasible in many 
applications to ameliorate the energy limitations in sensor networks in 
this paper we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows 
energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty 
cycle according to the energy availability in the environment the 
algorithm has three objectives namely a achieving energy neutral 
operation i e energy consumption should not be more than the energy 
provided by the environment b maximizing the system performance 
based on an application utility model subject to the above 
energyneutrality constraint and c adapting to the dynamics of the energy 
source at run-time we present a model that enables harvesting sensor 
nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data 
we also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable 
performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of 
the energy source our methods are evaluated using data gathered from 
a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our 
algorithm can utilize up to more environmental energy compared 
to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used

 introduction 
energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing 
battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and 
utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to 
sustain the operation the fidelity of the data produced by a sensor 
network begins to degrade once sensor nodes start to run out of 
battery power therefore harvesting energy from the environment 
has been proposed to supplement or completely replace battery 
supplies to enhance system lifetime and reduce the maintenance cost 
of replacing batteries periodically 
however metrics for evaluating energy harvesting systems are 
different from those used for battery powered systems 
environmental energy is distinct from battery energy in two ways 
first it is an inexhaustible supply which if appropriately used can 
allow the system to last forever unlike the battery which is a limited 
resource second there is an uncertainty associated with its 
availability and measurement compared to the energy stored in the 
battery which can be known deterministically thus power 
management methods based on battery status are not always 
applicable to energy harvesting systems in addition most power 
management schemes designed for battery-powered systems only 
account for the dynamics of the energy consumers e g cpu radio 
but not the dynamics of the energy supply consequently battery 
powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that 
meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize 
the system life energy harvesting systems on the other hand can 
provide enhanced performance depending on the available energy 
in this paper we will study how to adapt the performance of the 
available energy profile there exist many techniques to accomplish 
performance scaling at the node level such as radio transmit power 
adjustment dynamic voltage scaling and the use of low 
power modes however these techniques require hardware 
support and may not always be available on resource constrained 
sensor nodes alternatively a common performance scaling 
technique is duty cycling low power devices typically provide at 
least one low power mode in which the node is shut down and the 
power consumption is negligible in addition the rate of duty cycling 
is directly related to system performance metrics such as network 
latency and sampling frequency we will use duty cycle adjustment 
as the primitive performance scaling technique in our algorithms 
 related work 
energy harvesting has been explored for several different types 
of systems such as wearable computers sensor networks 
 etc several technologies to extract energy from the environment 
have been demonstrated including solar motion-based biochemical 
vibration-based and others are being developed 
 while several energy harvesting sensor node platforms 
have been prototyped there is a need for systematic 
power management techniques that provide performance guarantees 
during system operation the first work to take environmental 
energy into account for data routing was followed by 
while these works did demonstrate that environment aware 
decisions improve performance compared to battery aware decisions 
their objective was not to achieve energy neutral operation our 
proposed techniques attempt to maximize system performance while 
maintaining energy-neutral operation 
 system model 
the energy usage considerations in a harvesting system vary 
significantly from those in a battery powered system as mentioned 
earlier we propose the model shown in figure for designing 
energy management methods in a harvesting system the functions 
of the various blocks shown in the figure are discussed below the 
precise methods used in our system to achieve these functions will 
be discussed in subsequent sections 
harvested energy tracking this block represents the mechanisms 
used to measure the energy received from the harvesting device 
such as the solar panel such information is useful for determining 
the energy availability profile and adapting system performance 
based on it collecting this information requires that the node 
hardware be equipped with the facility to measure the power 
generated from the environment and the heliomote platform 
we used for evaluating the algorithms has this capability 
energy generation model for wireless sensor nodes with limited 
storage and processing capabilities to be able to use the harvested 
energy data models that represent the essential components of this 
information without using extensive storage are required the 
purpose of this block is to provide a model for the energy available 
to the system in a form that may be used for making power 
management decisions the data measured by the energy tracking 
block is used here to predict future energy availability a good 
prediction model should have a low prediction error and provide 
predicted energy values for durations long enough to make 
meaningful performance scaling decisions further for energy 
sources that exhibit both long-term and short-term patterns e g 
diurnal and climate variations vs weather patterns for solar energy 
the model must be able to capture both characteristics such a model 
can also use information from external sources such as local weather 
forecast service to improve its accuracy 
energy consumption model it is also important to have detailed 
information about the energy usage characteristics of the system at 
various performance levels for general applicability of our design 
we will assume that only one sleep mode is available we assume 
that the power consumption in the sleep and active modes is known 
it may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced 
capabilities such as dynamic voltage scaling dvs multiple low 
power modes and the capability to shut down system components 
selectively the power consumption in each of the states and the 
resultant effect on application performance should be known to make 
power management decisions 
energy storage model this block represents the model for the 
energy storage technology since all the generated energy may not be 
used instantaneously the harvesting system will usually have some 
energy storage technology storage technologies e g batteries and 
ultra-capacitors are non-ideal in that there is some energy loss while 
storing and retrieving energy from them these characteristics must be 
known to efficiently manage energy usage and storage this block also 
includes the system capability to measure the residual stored energy 
most low power systems use batteries to store energy and provide 
residual battery status this is commonly based on measuring the 
battery voltage which is then mapped to the residual battery energy 
using the known charge to voltage relationship for the battery 
technology in use more sophisticated methods which track the flow of 
energy into and out of the battery are also available 
harvesting-aware power management the inputs provided by the 
previously mentioned blocks are used here to determine the suitable 
power management strategy for the system power management 
could be carried to meet different objectives in different applications 
for instance in some systems the harvested energy may marginally 
supplement the battery supply and the objective may be to maximize 
the system lifetime a more interesting case is when the harvested 
energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with 
the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime in such 
cases the power management objective is to achieve energy neutral 
operation in other words the system should only use as much 
energy as harvested from the environment and attempt to maximize 
performance within this available energy budget 
 theoretically optimal power 
management 
we develop the following theory to understand the energy 
neutral mode of operation let us define ps t as the energy harvested 
from the environment at time t and the energy being consumed by 
the load at that time is pc t further we model the non-ideal storage 
buffer by its round-trip efficiency Î· strictly less than and a 
constant leakage power pleak using this notation applying the rule 
of energy conservation leads to the following inequality

this function can be used to model both energy sources and loads 
if the harvested energy profile ps t is a Ï Ï Ï function then the 
average rate of available energy over long durations becomes Ï and 
the burstiness is bounded by Ï and Ï similarly pc t can be modeled 
as a Ï Ï function when Ï and Ï are used to place an upper bound 
on power consumption the inequality on the right side while there are 
no minimum power consumption constraints 
the condition for energy neutrality equation leads to the 
following theorem based on the energy production consumption and 
energy buffer models discussed above 
theorem energy neutral operation consider 
a harvesting system in which the energy production profile is 
characterized by a Ï Ï Ï function the load is characterized by 
a Ï Ï function and the energy buffer is characterized by

to adjust the duty cycle d using our performance scaling

this is a fairly general and simple model and the specific values of 
dmin and dmax may be determined as per application requirements as 
an example consider a sensor node designed to detect intrusion across 
a periphery in this case a linear increase in duty cycle translates into a 
linear increase in the detection probability the fastest and the slowest 
speeds of the intruders may be known leading to a minimum and

maximum sensing delay tolerable which results in the relevant dmax 
and dmin for the sensor node while there may be cases where the 
relationship between utility and duty cycle may be non-linear in this 
paper we restrict our focus on applications that follow this linear 
model in view of the above models for the system components and 
the required performance the objective of our power management 
strategy is adjust the duty cycle d i dynamically so as to maximize 
the total utility u d over a period of time while ensuring energy 
neutral operation for the sensor node 
before discussing the performance scaling methods for harvesting 
aware duty cycle adaptation let us first consider the optimal power 
management strategy that is possible for a given energy generation 
profile for the calculation of the optimal strategy we assume 
complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node 
including the availability in the future the calculation of the optimal is 
a useful tool for evaluating the performance of our proposed algorithm 
this is particularly useful for our algorithm since no prior algorithms 
are available to serve as a baseline for comparison 
suppose the time axis is partitioned into discrete slots of duration 
Î´t and the duty cycle adaptation calculation is carried out over a 
window of nw such time slots we define the following energy profile 
variables with the index i ranging over   nw ps i is the power 
output from the harvested source in time slot i averaged over the slot 
duration pc is the power consumption of the load in active mode and 
d i is the duty cycle used in slot i whose value is to be determined 
b i is the residual battery energy at the beginning of slot i following 
this convention the battery energy left after the last slot in the window 
is represented by b nw the values of these variables will depend 
on the choice of d i 
the energy used directly from the harvested source and the energy 
stored and used from the battery must be accounted for differently 
figure shows two possible cases for ps i in a time slot ps i may 
either be less than or higher than pc as shown on the left and right 
respectively when ps i is lower than pc some of the energy used by 
the load comes from the battery while when ps i is higher than pc all 
the energy used is supplied directly from the harvested source the 
crosshatched area shows the energy that is available for storage into 
the battery while the hashed area shows the energy drawn from the 
battery we can write the energy used from the battery in any slot i as 
 c cs s sb i b i td i p p i tp i d i td i p i pÎ· Î· 
 
â Î´ â â Î´ â â â 
in equation the first term on the right hand side measures the 
energy drawn from the battery when ps i pc the next term measures 
the energy stored into the battery when the node is in sleep mode and 
the last term measures the energy stored into the battery in active mode 
if ps i pc for energy neutral operation we require the battery at the 
end of the window of nw slots to be greater than or equal to the starting 
battery clearly battery level will go down when the harvested energy 
is not available and the system is operated from stored energy 
however the window nw is judiciously chosen such that over that 
duration we expect the environmental energy availability to complete 
a periodic cycle for instance in the case of solar energy harvesting 
nw could be chosen to be a twenty-four hour duration corresponding 
to the diurnal cycle in the harvested energy this is an approximation 
since an ideal choice of the window size would be infinite but a finite 
size must be used for analytical tractability further the battery level 
cannot be negative at any time and this is ensured by having a large 
enough initial battery level b such that node operation is sustained 
even in the case of total blackout during a window period stating the 
above constraints quantitatively we can express the calculation of the 
optimal duty cycles as an optimization problem below

the solution to the optimization problem yields the duty cycles 
that must be used in every slot and the evolution of residual battery 
over the course of nw slots note that while the constraints above 
contain the non-linear function x 
 the quantities occurring within 
that function are all known constants the variable quantities occur 
only in linear terms and hence the above optimization problem can 
be solved using standard linear programming techniques available 
in popular optimization toolboxes 
 harvesting-aware power 
management 
we now present a practical algorithm for power management that 
may be used for adapting the performance based on harvested energy 
information this algorithm attempts to achieve energy neutral 
operation without using knowledge of the future energy availability 
and maximizes the achievable performance within that constraint 
the harvesting-aware power management strategy consists of 
three parts the first part is an instantiation of the energy generation 
model which tracks past energy input profiles and uses them to 
predict future energy availability the second part computes the 
optimal duty cycles based on the predicted energy and this step 
uses our computationally tractable method to solve the optimization 
problem the third part consists of a method to dynamically adapt 
the duty cycle in response to the observed energy generation profile 
in real time this step is required since the observed energy 
generation may deviate significantly from the predicted energy 
availability and energy neutral operation must be ensured with the 
actual energy received rather than the predicted values 
 energy prediction model 
we use a prediction model based on exponentially weighted 
moving-average ewma the method is designed to exploit the 
diurnal cycle in solar energy but at the same time adapt to the seasonal 
variations a historical summary of the energy generation profile is 
maintained for this purpose while the storage data size is limited to a 
vector length of nw values in order to minimize the memory overheads 
of the power management algorithm the window size is effectively 
infinite as each value in the history window depends on all the 
observed data up to that instant the window size is chosen to be 
hours and each time slot is taken to be minutes as the variation in 
generated power by the solar panel using this setting is less than 
between each adjacent slots this yields nw smaller slot 
durations may be used at the expense of a higher nw 
the historical summary maintained is derived as follows on a 
typical day we expect the energy generation to be similar to the energy 
generation at the same time on the previous days the value of energy 
generated in a particular slot is maintained as a weighted average of the 
energy received in the same time-slot during all observed days the 
weights are exponential resulting in decaying contribution from older

data more specifically the historical average maintained for each slot 
is given by 
 k k kx x xÎ± Î±â â 
where Î± is the value of the weighting factor kx is the observed value 
of energy generated in the slot and kx â 
is the previously stored 
historical average in this model the importance of each day relative to 
the previous one remains constant because the same weighting factor 
was used for all days 
the average value derived for a slot is treated as an estimate of 
predicted energy value for the slot corresponding to the subsequent 
day this method helps the historical average values adapt to the 
seasonal variations in energy received on different days one of the 
parameters to be chosen in the above prediction method is the 
parameter Î± which is a measure of rate of shift in energy pattern over 
time since this parameter is affected by the characteristics of the 
energy and sensor node location the system should have a training 
period during which this parameter will be determined to determine a 
good value of Î± we collected energy data over days and compared 
the average error of the prediction method for various values of Î± the 
error based on the different values of Î± is shown in figure this 
curve suggests an optimum value of Î± for minimum prediction 
error and this value will be used in the remainder of this paper 
 low-complexity solution 
the energy values predicted for the next window of nw slots are 
used to calculated the desired duty cycles for the next window 
assuming the predicted values match the observed values in the future 
since our objective is to develop a practical algorithm for embedded 
computing systems we present a simplified method to solve the linear 
programming problem presented in section to this end we define 
the sets s and d as follows

the two sets differ by the condition that whether the node operation 
can be sustained entirely from environmental energy in the case that 
energy produced from the environment is not sufficient battery will be 
discharged to supplement the remaining energy next we sum up both

this form facilitates a low complexity solution that doesn t require 
a general linear programming solver since our objective is to 
maximize the total system utility it is preferable to set the duty cycle to 
dmin for time slots where the utility per unit energy is the least on the 
other hand we would also like the time slots with the highest ps to 
operate at dmax because of better efficiency of using energy directly

a negative r concludes that the optimization problem is infeasible 
meaning the system cannot achieve energy neutrality even at the 
minimum duty cycle in this case the system designer is responsible 
for increasing the environment energy availability e g by using larger 
solar panels if r is positive it means the system has excess energy 
that is not being used and this may be allocated to increase the duty 
cycle beyond dmin for some slots since our objective is to maximize 
the total system utility the most efficient way to allocate the excess 
energy is to assign duty cycle dmax to the slots with the highest w i 
so the coefficients w i are arranged in decreasing order and duty 
cycle dmax is assigned to the slots beginning with the largest 
coefficients until the excess energy available r computed by in 
every iteration is insufficient to assign dmax to another slot the 
remaining energy rlast is used to increase the duty cycle to some 
value between dmin and dmax in the slot with the next lower coefficient

 slot-by-slot continual duty cycle adaptiation 
the observed energy values may vary greatly from the predicted 
ones such as due to the effect of clouds or other sudden changes it is 
thus important to adapt the duty cycles calculated using the predicted 
values to the actual energy measurements in real time to ensure energy 
neutrality denote the initial duty cycle assignments for each time slot i

the upper term accounts for the energy difference when actual 
received energy is more than the power drawn by the load on the 
other hand if the energy received is less than pc we will need to 
account for the extra energy used from the battery by the load which is 
a function of duty cycle used in time slot i and battery efficiency factor 
Î· when more energy is received than predicted x is positive and that 
excess energy is available for use in the subsequent solutes while if x 
is negative that energy must be compensated from subsequent slots 
case i x in this case we want to reduce the duty cycles used in 
the future slots in order to make up for this shortfall of energy since 
our objective function is to maximize the total system utility we have 
to reduce the duty cycles for time slots with the smallest normalized 
utility coefficient w i this is accomplished by first sorting the 
coefficient w j where j i in decreasing order and then iteratively 
reducing dj to dmin until the total reduction in energy consumption is 
the same as x 
case ii x here we want to increase the duty cycles used in the 
future to utilize this excess energy we received in recent time slot in 
contrast to case i the duty cycles of future time slots with highest 
utility coefficient w i should be increased first in order to maximize 
the total system utility

the precise procedure to adapt the duty cycle to account for the 
above factors is presented in algorithm this calculation is 
performed at the end of every slot to set the duty cycle for the next 
slot we claim that our duty cycling algorithm is energy neutral 
because an surplus of energy at the previous time slot will always 
translate to additional energy opportunity for future time slots and 
vice versa the claim may be violated in cases of severe energy 
shortages especially towards the end of window for example a large 
deficit in energy supply can t be restored if there is no future energy 
input until the end of the window in such case this offset will be 
carried over to the next window so that long term energy neutrality is 
still maintained 
 evaluation 
our adaptive duty cycling algorithm was evaluated using an actual 
solar energy profile measured using a sensor node called heliomote 
capable of harvesting solar energy this platform not only tracks 
the generated energy but also the energy flow into and out of the 
battery to provide an accurate estimate of the stored energy 
the energy harvesting platform was deployed in a residential area 
in los angeles from the beginning of june through the middle of 
august for a total of days the sensor node used is a mica mote 
running at a fixed duty cycle with an initially full battery battery 
voltage and net current from the solar panels are sampled at a period of 
 seconds the energy generation profile for that duration measured 
by tracking the output current from the solar cell is shown in figure 
both on continuous and diurnal scales we can observe that although 
the energy profile varies from day to day it still exhibits a general 
pattern over several days

we first evaluate the performance of the prediction model which 
is judged by the amount of absolute error it made between the

of each time slot in ma over the entire days generally the amount 
of error is larger during the day time because that s when the factor of 
weather can cause deviations in received energy while the prediction 
made for night time is mostly correct 
 adaptive duty cycling algorithm 
prior methods to optimize performance while achieving energy 
neutral operation using harvested energy are scarce instead we 
compare the performance of our algorithm against two extremes the 
theoretical optimal calculated assuming complete knowledge about 
future energy availability and a simple approach which attempts to 
achieve energy neutrality using a fixed duty cycle without accounting 
for battery inefficiency 
the optimal duty cycles are calculated for each slot using the 
future knowledge of actual received energy for that slot for the simple 
approach the duty cycle is kept constant within each day and is

we then compare the performance of our algorithm to the two 
extremes with varying battery efficiency figure shows the results 
using dmax and dmin the battery efficiency was varied 
from to on the x-axis and solar energy utilizations achieved by 
the three algorithms are shown on the y-axis it shows the fraction of 
net received energy that is used to perform useful work rather than lost 
due to storage inefficiency 
as can be seen from the figure battery efficiency factor has great 
impact on the performance of the three different approaches the three 
approaches all converges to utilization if we have a perfect 
battery Î· that is energy is not lost by storing it into the batteries 
when battery inefficiency is taken into account both the adaptive and 
optimal approach have much better solar energy utilization rate than 
the simple one additionally the result also shows that our adaptive 
duty cycle algorithm performs extremely close to the optimal

we also compare the performance of our algorithm with different 
values of dmin and dmax for Î· which is typical of nimh batteries 
these results are shown in table as the percentage of energy saved 
by the optimal and adaptive approaches and this is the energy which 
would normally be wasted in the simple approach the figures and 
table indicate that our real time algorithm is able to achieve a 
performance very close to the optimal feasible in addition these 
results show that environmental energy harvesting with appropriate 
power management can achieve much better utilization of the 
environmental energy

 conclusions 
we discussed various issues in power management for systems 
powered using environmentally harvested energy specifically we 
designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the 
constraint of energy neutral operation we also derived a theoretically 
optimal bound on the performance and showed that our proposed 
algorithm operated very close to the optimal the proposals were 
evaluated using real data collected using an energy harvesting sensor 
node deployed in an outdoor environment 
our method has significant advantages over currently used 
methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and 
can only provide sub-optimal performance however this work is only 
the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation it 
is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the 
duty cycle several other power scaling methods such as dvs 
submodule power switching and the use of multiple low power modes are 
also available it is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit 
these advanced capabilities
