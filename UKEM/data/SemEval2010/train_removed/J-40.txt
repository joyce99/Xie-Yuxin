 introduction 
in this paper we introduce and examine a natural 
extension of classical evolutionary game theory egt to a setting 
in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of 
an undirected graph or network this extension generalizes 
the classical setting in which all pairs of organisms in an 
infinite population are equally likely to interact the 
classical setting can be viewed as the special case in which the 
underlying network is a clique 
there are many obvious reasons why one would like to 
examine more general graphs the primary one being in that 
many scenarios considered in evolutionary game theory all 
interactions are in fact not possible for example 
geographical restrictions may limit interactions to physically 
proximate pairs of organisms more generally as evolutionary 
game theory has become a plausible model not only for 
biological interaction but also economic and other kinds of 
interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than 
optimizing see and chapter of the network 
constraints may come from similarly more general sources 
evolutionary game theory on networks has been considered 
before but not in the generality we will do so here see 
section 
we generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable 
strategy ess to networks and show a pair of complementary 
results that exhibit the power of randomization in our 
setting subject to degree or edge density conditions the 
classical ess of any game are preserved when the graph is 
chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially 
or when the graph is chosen adversarially and the mutation 
set is chosen randomly we examine natural strengthenings 
of our generalized ess definition and show that similarly 
strong results are not possible for them 
the work described here is part of recent efforts 
examining the relationship between graph topology or structure 
and properties of equilibrium outcomes previous works in 
this line include studies of the relationship of topology to 
properties of correlated equilibria in graphical games 
and studies of price variation in graph-theoretic market 
exchange models more generally this work contributes 
to the line of graph-theoretic models for game theory 
investigated in both computer science and economics 
 classical egt 
the fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is 
the evolutionarily stable strategy ess intuitively an ess 
is a strategy such that if all the members of a population 
adopt it then no mutant strategy could invade the 
population to make this more precise we describe the basic 
model of evolutionary game theory in which the notion of 
an ess resides 
the standard model of evolutionary game theory 
considers an infinite population of organisms each of which plays 
a strategy in a fixed -player symmetric game the game 
is defined by a fitness function f all pairs of members of 
the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one 
another if two organisms interact one playing strategy s 
 
and the other playing strategy t the s-player earns a fitness 
of f s t while the t-player earns a fitness of f t s 
in this infinite population of organisms suppose there is a 
 − fraction who play strategy s and call these organisms 
incumbents and suppose there is an fraction who play t 
and call these organisms mutants assume two organisms 
are chosen uniformly at random to play each other the 
strategy s is an ess if the expected fitness of an 
organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t 
for all t s and all sufficiently small since an 
incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability − 
and it will meet a mutant with probability we can 
calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent which is simply 
 − f s s f s t similarly the expected fitness of 
a mutant is − f t s f t t thus we come to the 
formal definition of an ess 
definition a strategy s is an evolutionarily stable 
strategy ess for the -player symmetric game given by 
fitness function f if for every strategy t s there exists 
an t such that for all t − f s s f s t 
 − f t s f t t 
a consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ess 
it must be the case that f s s ≥ f t s for all strategies 
t this inequality means that s must be a best response 
to itself and thus any ess strategy s must also be a nash 
equilibrium in general the notion of ess is more 
restrictive than nash equilibrium and not all -player symmetric 
games have an ess 
in this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of 
network structure preserve the ess strategies for those games 
that do have a standard ess first we must of course 
generalize the definition of ess to a network setting 
 egt on graphs 
in our setting we will no longer assume that two 
organisms are chosen uniformly at random to interact instead 
we assume that organisms interact only with those in their 
local neighborhood as defined by an undirected graph or 
network as in the classical setting which can be viewed 
as the special case of the complete network or clique we 
shall assume an infinite population by which we mean we 
examine limiting behavior in a family of graphs of increasing 
size 
before giving formal definitions some comments are in 
order on what to expect in moving from the classical to the 
graph-theoretic setting in the classical complete graph 
setting there exist many symmetries that may be broken in 
moving to the the network setting at both the group and 
individual level indeed such asymmetries are the primary 
interest in examining a graph-theoretic generalization 
for example at the group level in the standard ess 
definition one need not discuss any particular set of mutants of 
population fraction since all organisms are equally likely 
to interact the survival or fate of any specific mutant set is 
identical to that of any other in the network setting this 
may not be true some mutant sets may be better able to 
survive than others due to the specific topologies of their 
interactions in the network for instance foreshadowing some 
of our analysis if s is an ess but f t t is much larger than 
f s s and f s t a mutant set with a great deal of 
internal interaction that is edges between mutants may be 
able to survive whereas one without this may suffer at 
the level of individuals in the classical setting the assertion 
that one mutant dies implies that all mutants die again by 
symmetry in the network setting individual fates may 
differ within a group all playing a common strategy these 
observations imply that in examining ess on networks we 
face definitional choices that were obscured in the classical 
model 
if g is a graph representing the allowed pairwise 
interactions between organisms vertices and u is a vertex of g 
playing strategy su then the fitness of u is given by 
f u 
p 
v∈γ u f su sv 
 γ u 
 
here sv is the strategy being played by the neighbor v and 
γ u v ∈ v u v ∈ e one can view the fitness of 
u as the average fitness u would obtain if it played each if 
its neighbors or the expected fitness u would obtain if it 
were assigned to play one of its neighbors chosen uniformly 
at random 
classical evolutionary game theory examines an infinite 
symmetric population graphs or networks are inherently 
finite objects and we are specifically interested in their 
asymmetries as discussed above thus all of our definitions shall 
revolve around an infinite family g gn ∞ 
n of finite 
graphs gn over n vertices but we shall examine asymptotic 
 large n properties of such families 
we first give a definition for a family of mutant vertex 
sets in such an infinite graph family to contract 
definition let g gn ∞ 
n be an infinite family 
of graphs where gn has n vertices let m mn ∞ 
n 
be any family of subsets of vertices of the gn such that 
 mn ≥ n for some constant suppose all the vertices 
of mn play a common mutant strategy t and suppose the 
remaining vertices in gn play a common incumbent 
strategy s we say that mn contracts if for sufficiently large n 
for all but o n of the j ∈ mn j has an incumbent neighbor 
i such that f j f i 
a reasonable alternative would be to ask that the 
condition above hold for all mutants rather than all but o n 
note also that we only require that a mutant have one 
incumbent neighbor of higher fitness in order to die one might 
considering requiring more in sections and we 
consider these stronger conditions and demonstrate that our 
results can no longer hold 
in order to properly define an ess for an infinite family of 
finite graphs in a way that recovers the classical definition 
asymptotically in the case of the family of complete graphs 
we first must give a definition that restricts attention to 
families of mutant vertices that are smaller than some invasion 
threshold n yet remain some constant fraction of the 
population this prevents invasions that survive merely by 
constituting a vanishing fraction of the population 
definition let and let g gn ∞ 
n be 
an infinite family of graphs where gn has n vertices let 
m mn ∞ 
n be any family of mutant vertices in gn 
we say that m is -linear if there exists an 
such that for all sufficiently large n n mn n 
we can now give our definition for a strategy to be 
evolutionarily stable when employed by organisms interacting 
with their neighborhood in a graph 
 
definition let g gn ∞ 
n be an infinite family 
of graphs where gn has n vertices let f be any -player 
symmetric game for which s is a strategy we say that s is 
an ess with respect to f and g if for all mutant strategies 
t s there exists an t such that for any t-linear 
family of mutant vertices m mn ∞ 
n all playing t for n 
sufficiently large mn contracts 
thus to violate the ess property for g one must witness 
a family of mutations m in which each mn is an arbitrarily 
small but nonzero constant fraction of the population of gn 
but does not contract i e every mutant set has a subset of 
linear size that survives all of its incumbent interactions 
in section a we show that the definition given coincides 
with the classical one in the case where g is the family of 
complete graphs in the limit of large n we note that even 
in the classical model small sets of mutants were allowed to 
have greater fitness than the incumbents as long as the size 
of the set was o n 
in the definition above there are three parameters the 
game f the graph family g and the mutation family m 
our main results will hold for any -player symmetric game 
f we will also study two rather general settings for g and 
m that in which g is a family of random graphs and m is 
arbitrary and that in which g is nearly arbitrary and m is 
randomly chosen in both cases we will see that subject to 
conditions on degree or edge density essentially forcing 
connectivity of g but not much more for any -player 
symmetric game the ess of the classical settings and only those 
strategies are always preserved thus a common theme of 
these results is the power of randomization as long as either 
the network itself is chosen randomly or the mutation set is 
chosen randomly classical ess are preserved 
 related work 
there has been previous work that analyzes which 
strategies are resilient to mutant invasions with respect to various 
types of graphs what sets our work apart is that the model 
we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of 
games and graph topologies we will briefly survey this 
literature and point out the differences in the previous models 
and ours 
in and the authors consider specific families 
of graphs such as cycles and lattices where players play 
specific games such as × -games or k × k-coordination 
games in these papers the authors specify a simple local 
dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing 
strategies and analyze what type of strategies will grow to 
dominate the population the model we propose is more 
general than both of these as it encompasses a larger class 
of graphs as well as a richer set of games 
also related to our work is that of where the authors 
propose two models the first assumes organisms interact 
according to a weighted undirected graph however the 
fitness of each organism is simply assigned and does not 
depend on the actions of each organism s neighborhood the 
second model has organisms arranged around a directed 
cycle where neighbors play a × -game with probability 
proportional to its fitness an organism is chosen to 
reproduce by placing a replica of itself in its neighbors position 
thereby killing the neighbor we consider more general 
games than the first model and more general graphs than 
the second 
finally the works most closely related to ours are 
and the authors consider -action coordination games 
played by players in a general undirected graph in these 
three works the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to 
reproduce and analyze properties of the graph that allow a 
strategy to overrun the population here again one can see 
that our model is more general than these as it allows for 
organisms to play any -player symmetric game 
 networks preserving ess 
we now proceed to state and prove two complementary 
results in the network ess model defined in section first 
we consider a setting where the graphs are generated via the 
gn p model of erd˝os and r´enyi in this model every 
pair of vertices are joined by an edge independently and 
with probability p where p may depend on n the mutant 
set however will be constructed adversarially subject to 
the linear size constraint given by definition for these 
settings we show that for any -player symmetric game s 
is a classical ess of that game if and only if s is an ess 
for gn p ∞ 
n where p ω nc 
 and ≤ c and any 
mutant family mn ∞ 
n where each mn has linear size we 
note that under these settings if we let c − γ for small 
γ the expected number of edges in gn is n γ 
or larger 
- that is just superlinear in the number of vertices and 
potentially far smaller than o n 
 it is easy to convince 
oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of 
edges we are flirting with disconnectedness and there may 
simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due 
to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games 
thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge 
density 
the second result is a kind of dual to the first considering 
a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily subject to 
conditions but the mutant sets are chosen randomly it 
states that for any -player symmetric game s is a 
classical ess for that game if and only if s is an ess for any 
 gn vn en ∞ 
n in which for all v ∈ vn deg v ω nγ 
 
 for any constant γ and a family of mutant sets 
 mn ∞ 
n that is chosen randomly that is in which each 
organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability 
thus in this setting we again find that classical ess are 
preserved subject to edge density restrictions since the degree 
assumption is somewhat strong we also prove another result 
which only assumes that en ≥ n γ 
 and shows that there 
must exist at least mutant with an incumbent neighbor of 
higher fitness as opposed to showing that all but o n 
mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness as will 
be discussed this rules out stationary mutant invasions 
 random graphs adversarial mutations 
now we state and prove a theorem which shows that if s 
is a classical ess then s will be an ess for random graphs 
where a linear sized set of mutants is chosen by an adversary 
theorem let f be any -player symmetric game 
and suppose s is a classical ess of f let the infinite 
graph family gn ∞ 
n be drawn according to gn p where 
p ω nc 
 and ≤ c then with probability s is 
an ess 
the main idea of the proof is to divide mutants into 
categories those with normal fitness and those with 
ab 
normal fitness first we show all but o n of the 
population incumbent or mutant have an incumbent neighbor of 
normal fitness this will imply that all but o n of the 
mutants of normal fitness have an incumbent neighbor of higher 
fitness the vehicle for proving this is theorem of 
which gives an upper bound on the number of vertices not 
connected to a sufficiently large set this theorem assumes 
that the size of this large set is known with equality which 
necessitates the union bound argument below secondly we 
show that there can be at most o n mutants with abnormal 
fitness since there are so few of them even if none of them 
have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness s will still be 
an ess with respect to f and g 
proof sketch let t s be the mutant strategy since 
s is a classical ess there exists an t such that − f s s 
f s t − f t s f t t for all t let m 
be any mutant family that is t-linear thus for any fixed 
value of n that is sufficiently large there exists an such 
that mn n and t also let in vn \ mn and 
let i ⊆ in be the set of incumbents that have fitness in the 
range ± τ − f s s f s t for some constant τ 
 τ lemma below shows − n ≥ i ≥ 
 − n − log n 
τ p 
 finally let 
ti x ∈ v \ i γ x ∩ i ∅ 
 for the sake of clarity we suppress the subscript n on the 
sets i and t the union bound gives us 
pr ti ≥ δn ≤ 
 − n 
x 
i − n− log n 
τ p 
pr ti ≥ δn and i i 
letting δ n−γ 
for some γ gives δn o n we will 
apply theorem of to the summand on the right hand 
side of equation if we let γ −c and combine this 
with the fact that ≤ c all of the requirements of this 
theorem will be satisfied details omitted now when we 
apply this theorem to equation we get 
pr ti ≥ δn ≤ 
 − n 
x 
i − n− log n 
τ p 
exp 
„ 
− 
 
 
cδn 
 
 
 o 
this is because equation has only log n 
τ p 
terms and 
theorem of gives us that c ≥ − n −c 
− log n 
τ 
thus we have shown with probability tending to as n → 
∞ at most o n individuals are not attached to an 
incumbent which has fitness in the range ± τ − f s s 
f s t this implies that the number of mutants of 
approximately normal fitness not attached to an incumbent 
of approximately normal fitness is also o n 
now those mutants of approximately normal fitness that 
are attached to an incumbent of approximately normal 
fitness have fitness in the range ±τ − f t s f t t 
the incumbents that they are attached to have fitness in the 
range ±τ − f s s f s t since s is an ess of f 
we know − f s s f s t − f t s f t t thus 
if we choose τ small enough we can ensure that all but o n 
mutants of normal fitness have a neighboring incumbent of 
higher fitness 
finally by lemma we know there are at most o n 
mutants of abnormal fitness so even if all of them are more fit 
than their respective incumbent neighbors we have shown 
all but o n of the mutants have an incumbent neighbor of 
higher fitness 
we now state and prove the lemma used in the proof 
above 
lemma for almost every graph gn p with − n 
incumbents all but log n 
δ p 
incumbents have fitness in the 
range ±δ − f s s f s t where p ω nc 
 and 
 δ and c are constants satisfying δ 
 ≤ c similarly under the same assumptions all 
but log n 
δ p 
mutants have fitness in the range ± δ − 
 f t s f t t 
proof we define the mutant degree of a vertex to be 
the number of mutant neighbors of that vertex and 
incumbent degree analogously observe that the only way for 
an incumbent to have fitness far from its expected value of 
 − f s s f s t is if it has a fraction of mutant 
neighbors either much higher or much lower than theorem 
 of gives us a bound on the number of such 
incumbents it states that the number of incumbents with mutant 
degree outside the range ± δ p m is at most log n 
δ p 
 by 
the same theorem the number of incumbents with 
incumbent degree outside the range ± δ p i is at most log n 
δ p 
 
from the linearity of fitness as a function of the fraction 
of mutant or incumbent neighbors one can show that for 
those incumbents with mutant and incumbent degree in the 
expected range their fitness is within a constant factor of 
 − f s s f s t where that constant goes to as n 
tends to infinity and δ tends to the proof for the mutant 
case is analogous 
we note that if in the statement of theorem we let 
c then p this in turn makes g kn ∞ 
n 
where kn is a clique of n vertices then for any kn all 
of the incumbents will have identical fitness and all of the 
mutants will have identical fitness furthermore since s was 
an ess for g the incumbent fitness will be higher than the 
mutant fitness finally one can show that as n → ∞ the 
incumbent fitness converges to − f s s f s t and 
the mutant fitness converges to − f t s f t t in 
other words s must be a classical ess providing a converse 
to theorem we rigorously present this argument in 
section a 
 adversarial graphs random mutations 
we now move on to our second main result here we show 
that if the graph family rather than being chosen randomly 
is arbitrary subject to a minimum degree requirement and 
the mutation sets are randomly chosen classical ess are 
again preserved a modified notion of ess allows us to 
considerably weaken the degree requirement to a minimum 
edge density requirement 
theorem let g gn vn en ∞ 
n be an 
infinite family of graphs in which for all v ∈ vn deg v ω nγ 
 
 for any constant γ let f be any -player symmetric 
game and suppose s is a classical ess of f let t be any 
mutant strategy and let the mutant family m mn ∞ 
n be 
chosen randomly by labeling each vertex a mutant with 
constant probability where t then with probability 
 s is an ess with respect to f g and m 
 
proof let t s be the mutant strategy and let x be 
the event that every incumbent has fitness within the range 
 ± τ − f s s f s t for some constant τ to 
be specified later similarly let y be the event that every 
mutant has fitness within the range ± τ − f t s 
f t t since pr x ∩ y − pr ¬x ∪ ¬y we proceed 
by showing pr ¬x ∪ ¬y o 
¬x is the event that there exists an incumbent with fitness 
outside the range ±τ − f s s f s t if degm v 
denotes the number of mutant neighbors of v similarly 
degi v denotes the number of incumbent neighbors of v 
then an incumbent i has fitness 
degi i 
deg i 
f s s 
degm i 
deg i 
f s t 
since f s s and f s t are fixed quantities the only 
variation in an incumbents fitness can come from variation in the 
terms degi i 
deg i 
and degm i 
deg i 
 one can use the chernoff bound 
followed by the union bound to show that for any incumbent 
i 
pr f i ∈ ± τ − f s s f s t 
 exp 
„ 
− 
deg i τ 
 
 
 
next one can use the union bound again to bound the 
probability of the event ¬x 
pr ¬x ≤ n exp 
„ 
− 
diτ 
 
 
where di mini∈v \m deg i ≤ an analogous 
argument can be made to show pr ¬y n exp − 
dj τ 
 
 
where dj minj∈m deg j and ≤ thus by the 
union bound 
pr ¬x ∪ ¬y n exp 
„ 
− 
dτ 
 
 
where d minv∈v deg v ≤ since deg v 
ω nγ 
 for all v ∈ v and τ and γ are all constants greater 
than 
lim 
n→∞ 
 n 
exp dτ 
 
so pr ¬x∪¬y o thus we can choose τ small enough 
such that τ − f t s f t t − τ − 
 f s s f s t and then choose n large enough such that 
with probability − o every incumbent will have fitness 
in the range ±τ − f s s f s t and every mutant 
will have fitness in the range ± τ − f t s f t t 
so with high probability every incumbent will have a higher 
fitness than every mutant 
by arguments similar to those following the proof of 
theorem if we let g kn ∞ 
n each incumbent will have 
the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness 
furthermore since s is an ess for g the incumbent fitness 
must be higher than the mutant fitness here again one 
has to show show that as n → ∞ the incumbent fitness 
converges to − f s s f s t and the mutant fitness 
converges to − f t s f t t observe that the exact 
fraction mutants of vn is now a random variable so to prove 
this convergence we use an argument similar to one that is 
used to prove that sequence of random variables that 
converges in probability also converges in distribution details 
omitted this in turn establishes that s must be a classical 
ess and we thus obtain a converse to theorem this 
argument is made rigorous in section a 
the assumption on the degree of each vertex of 
theorem is rather strong the following theorem relaxes 
this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have 
n γ 
edges for some constant γ in which case it shows 
there will alway be at least mutant with an incumbent 
neighbor of higher fitness a strategy that is an ess in 
this weakened sense will essentially rule out stable static 
sets of mutant invasions but not more complex invasions 
an example of more complex invasions are mutant sets that 
survive but only by perpetually migrating through the 
graph under some natural evolutionary dynamics akin to 
gliders in the well-known game of life 
theorem let f be any game and let s be a classical 
ess of f and let t s be a mutant strategy for any graph 
family g gn vn en ∞ 
n in which en ≥ n γ 
 for 
any constant γ and any mutant family m mn ∞ 
n 
which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with 
probability where t the probability that there 
exists a mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness 
approaches as n → ∞ 
proof sketch the main idea behind the proof is to 
show that with high probability over only the choice of 
mutants there will be an incumbent-mutant edge in which both 
vertices have high degree if their degree is high enough we 
can show that close to an fraction of their neighbors are 
mutants and thus their fitnesses are very close to what we 
expect them to be in the classical case since s is an ess 
the fitness of the incumbent will be higher than the mutant 
we call an edge i j ∈ en a g n -barbell if deg i ≥ g n 
and deg j ≥ g n suppose gn has at most h n edges that 
are g n -barbells this means there are at least en − h n 
edges in which at least one vertex has degree at most g n 
we call these vertices light vertices let n be the number 
of light vertices in gn observe that en −h n ≤ n g n 
this is because each light vertex is incident on at most g n 
edges this gives us that 
 en ≤ h n n g n ≤ h n ng n 
so if we choose h n and g n such that h n ng n 
o n γ 
 then en o n γ 
 this contradicts the 
assumption that en ω n γ 
 thus subject to the above 
constraint on h n and g n gn must contain at least h n 
edges that are g n -barbells 
now let hn denote the subgraph induced by the barbell 
edges of gn note that regardless of the structure of gn 
there is no reason that hn should be connected thus let 
m be the number of connected components of hn and let 
c c cm be the number of vertices in each of these 
connected components note that since hn is an edge-induced 
subgraph we have ck ≥ for all components k let us choose 
the mutant set by first flipping the vertices in hn only we 
now show that the probability with respect to the random 
mutant set that none of the components of hn have an 
incumbent-mutant edge is exponentially small in n let an 
be the event that every component of hn contains only 
mutants or only incumbents then algebraic manipulations can 
establish that 
pr an πm 
k ck 
 − ck 
 
≤ − − β 
 
 
pm 
k ck 
 
where β is a constant thus for sufficiently small the bound 
decreases exponentially with 
pm 
k ck furthermore sincepm 
k 
 ck 
 
´ 
≥ h n with equality achieved by making each 
component a clique one can show that 
pm 
k ck ≥ 
p 
h n 
thus as long as h n → ∞ with n the probability that all 
components are uniformly labeled will go to 
now assuming that there exists a non-uniformly labeled 
component by construction that component contains an 
edge i j where i is an incumbent and j is a mutant that 
is a g n -barbell we also assume that the h n vertices 
already labeled have been done so arbitrarily but that the 
remaining g n − h n vertices neighboring i and j are 
labeled mutants independently with probability then via 
a standard chernoff bound argument one can show that 
with high probability the fraction of mutants neighboring 
i and the fraction of mutants neighboring j is in the range 
 ± τ g n −h n 
g n 
 similarly one can show that the 
fraction of incumbents neighboring i and the fraction of mutants 
neighboring j is in the range − ± τ g n −h n 
g n 
 
since s is an ess there exists a ζ such that − 
 f s s f s t − f t s f t t ζ if we 
choose g n nγ 
 and h n o g n we can choose n 
large enough and τ small enough to force f i f j as 
desired 
 limitations of stronger models 
in this section we show that if one tried to strengthen 
the model described in section in two natural ways one 
would not be able to prove results as strong as theorems 
and which hold for every -player symmetric game 
 stronger contraction for the mutant set 
in section we alluded to the fact that we made certain 
design decisions in arriving at definitions and 
one such decision was to require that all but o n mutants 
have incumbent neighbors of higher fitness instead we 
could have required that all mutants have an incumbent 
neighbor of higher fitness the two theorems in this 
subsection show that if one were to strengthen our notion of 
contraction for the mutant set given by definition in 
this way it would be impossible to prove theorems analogous 
to theorems and 
recall that definition gave the notion of contraction 
for a linear sized subset of mutants in what follows we 
will say an edge i j contracts if i is an incumbent j is a 
mutant and f i f j also recall that theorem 
stated that if s is a classical ess then it is an ess for 
random graphs with adversarial mutations next we prove 
that if we instead required every incumbent-mutant edge to 
contract this need not be the case 
theorem let f be a -player symmetric game that 
has a classical ess s for which there exists a mutant 
strategy t s with f t t f s s and f t t f s t let 
g gn ∞ 
n be an infinite family of random graphs drawn 
according to gn p where p ω nc 
 for any constant 
 ≤ c then with probability approaching as n → ∞ 
there exists a mutant family m mn ∞ 
n where tn 
 mn n and t in which there is an edge that does 
not contract 
proof sketch with probability approaching as n → 
∞ there exists a vertex j where deg j is arbitrarily close 
to n so label j mutant label one of its neighbors 
incumbent denoted i and label the rest of j s neighborhood 
mutant also label all of i s neighbors incumbent with 
the exception of j and j s neighbors which were already 
labeled mutant in this setting one can show that f j 
will be arbitrarily close to f t t and f i will be a convex 
combination of f s s and f s t which are both strictly 
less than f t t 
theorem stated that if s is a classical ess then for 
graphs where en ≥ n γ 
 for some γ and where each 
organism is labeled a mutant with probability one edge 
must contract below we show that for certain graphs and 
certain games there will always exist one edge that will not 
contract 
theorem let f be a -player symmetric game that 
has a classical ess s such that there exists a mutant 
strategy t s where f t s f s t there exists an infinite 
family of graphs gn vn en ∞ 
n where en θ n 
 
such that for a mutant family m mn ∞ 
n which is 
determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability 
 the probability there exists an edge in en that does 
not contract approaches as n → ∞ 
proof sketch construct gn as follows pick n 
vertices u u un and add edges such that they from 
a clique then for each ui i ∈ n add edges ui vi 
 vi wi and wi xi with probability as n → ∞ there 
exists an i such that ui and wi are mutants and vi and xi 
are incumbents observe that f vi f xi f s t and 
f wi f t s 
 stronger contraction for individuals 
the model of section requires that for an edge i j to 
contract the fitness of i must be greater than the fitness of j 
one way to strengthen this notion of contraction would be 
to require that the maximum fitness incumbent in the 
neighborhood of j be more fit than the maximum fitness mutant 
in the neighborhood of j this models the idea that each 
organism is trying to take over each place in its 
neighborhood but only the most fit organism in the neighborhood 
of a vertex gets the privilege of taking it if we assume that 
we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants 
and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract we 
will next show that theorems and still hold and 
thus it is still impossible to get results such as theorems 
and which hold for every -player symmetric game 
in the proof of theorem we proved that f i is strictly 
less than f j observe that maximum fitness mutant in 
the neighborhood of j must have fitness at least f j also 
observe that there is only incumbent in the neighborhood 
of j namely i so under this stronger notion of contraction 
the edge i j will not contract 
similarly in the proof of theorem observe that the 
only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself which 
has fitness f t s furthermore the only incumbents in the 
neighborhood of wi are vi and xi both of which have fitness 
f s t by assumption f t s f s t thus under this 
stronger notion of contraction neither of the 
incumbentmutant edges vi wi and xi wi will contract

a graphical and classical ess 
in this section we explore the conditions under which a 
graphical ess is also a classical ess to do so we state and 
prove two theorems which provide converses to each of the 
major theorems in section 
a random graphs adversarial mutations 
theorem states that if s is a classical ess and g 
 gn p where p ω nc 
 and ≤ c then with 
probability as n → ∞ s is an ess with respect to g here we 
show that if s is an ess with respect to g then s is a 
classical ess in order to prove this theorem we do not need the 
full generality of s being an ess for g when p ω nc 
 
where ≤ c all we need is s to be an ess for g when 
p in this case there are no more probabilistic events 
in the theorem statement also since p each graph in 
g is a clique so if one incumbent has a higher fitness than 
one mutant then all incumbents have higher fitness than all 
mutants this gives rise to the following theorem 
theorem a let f be any -player symmetric game 
and suppose s is a strategy for f and t s is a mutant 
strategy let g kn ∞ 
n if as n → ∞ for any t-linear 
family of mutants m mn ∞ 
n there exists an incumbent 
i and a mutant j such that f i f j then s is a classical 
ess of f 
the proof of this theorem analyzes the limiting behavior 
of the mutant population as the size of the cliques in g tends 
to infinity it also shows how the definition of ess given in 
section recovers the classical definition of ess 
proof since each graph in g is a clique every 
incumbent will have the same number of incumbent and mutant 
neighbors and every mutant will have the same number of 
incumbent and mutant neighbors thus all incumbents will 
have identical fitness and all mutants will have identical 
fitness next one can construct an t-linear mutant family 
m where the fraction of mutants converges to for any 
where t so for n large enough the number of 
mutants in kn will be arbitrarily close to n thus any 
mutant subset of size n will result in all incumbents having 
fitness − n 
n− 
 f s s n 
n− 
f s t and all mutants 
having fitness − n− 
n− 
 f t s n−

f t t furthermore by 
assumption the incumbent fitness must be higher than the 
mutant fitness this implies

for all where t 
a adversarial graphs random mutations 
theorem states that if s is a classical ess for a 
 player symmetric game f where g is chosen adversarially 
subject to the constraint that the degree of each vertex is 
ω nγ 
 for any constant γ and mutants are chosen 
with probability then s is an ess with respect to f g 
and m here we show that if s is an ess with respect to f 
g and m then s is a classical ess 
all we will need to prove this is that s is an ess with 
respect to g kn ∞ 
n that is when each vertex has degree 
n − as in theorem a since the graphs are cliques if 
one incumbent has higher fitness than one mutant then all 
incumbents have higher fitness than all mutants thus the 
theorem below is also a converse to theorem recall 
that theorem uses a weaker notion of contraction that 
 
requires only one incumbent to have higher fitness than one 
mutant 
theorem a let f be any -player symmetric game 
and suppose s is an incumbent strategy for f and t s 
is a mutant strategy let g kn ∞ 
n if with 
probability as n → ∞ s is an ess for g and a mutant family 
m mn ∞ 
n which is determined by labeling each vertex 
a mutant with probability where t then s is a 
classical ess of f 
this proof also analyzes the limiting behavior of the 
mutant population as the size of the cliques in g tends to 
infinity since the mutants are chosen randomly we will use 
an argument similar to the proof that a sequence of random 
variables that converges in probability also converge in 
distribution in this case the sequence of random variables will 
be actual fraction of mutants in each kn 
proof fix any value of where n and 
construct each mn by labeling a vertex a mutant with 
probability by the same argument as in the proof of theorem a 
if the actual number of mutants in kn is denoted by nn 
any mutant subset of size nn will result in all incumbents 
having fitness − nn

by two simple applications of the chernoff bound and an 
application of the union bound one can show the sequence 
of random variables n ∞ 
n converges to in probability 
next if we let xn − n x − b −f s s f t t 
and a − f t s −f s s 
f s t −f s s −f t t f t s 
 by theorem a 
below we get that limn→∞ pr xn a b n pr x a 
combining this with equation pr −a 
the proof of the following theorem is very similar to the 
proof that a sequence of random variables that converges in 
probability also converge in distribution a good 
explanation of this can be found in which is the basis for the 
argument below 
theorem a if xn ∞ 
n is a sequence of random 
variables that converge in probability to the random variable x 
and a and b are constants then limn→∞ pr xn a b n 
pr x a 
proof by lemma a see below we have the following 
two inequalities 
pr x a b n − τ 
≤ pr xn a b n pr x − xn τ 
pr xn a b n 
≤ pr x a b n τ pr x − xn τ 
combining these gives 
pr x a b n − τ − pr x − xn τ 
≤ pr xn a b n 
≤ pr x a b n τ pr x − xn τ 
there exists an n such that for all n n b n τ so 
the following statement holds for all n n 
pr x a − τ − pr x − xn τ 
≤ pr xn a b n 
≤ pr x a τ pr x − xn τ 
take the limn→∞ of both sides of both inequalities and 
since xn converges in probability to x 
pr x a − τ ≤ lim 
n→∞ 
pr xn a b n 
≤ pr x a τ 
recall that x is a continuous random variable representing 
the fraction of mutants in an infinite sized graph so if we 
let fx a pr x a we see that fx a is a cumulative 
distribution function of a continuous random variable and 
is therefore continuous from the right so 
lim 
τ↓ 
fx a − τ lim 
τ↓ 
fx a τ fx a 
thus if we take the limτ↓ of inequalities and we get 
pr x a lim 
n→∞ 
pr xn a b n 
the following lemma is quite useful as it expresses the 
cumulative distribution of one random variable y in terms 
of the cumulative distribution of another random variable 
x and the difference between x and y 
lemma a if x and y are random variables c ∈ 
and τ then 
pr y c ≤ pr x c τ pr y − x τ 
proof 
pr y c 
 pr y c x c τ pr y c x ≥ c τ 
≤ pr y c x c τ pr x c τ 
 pr y − x τ 
≤ pr x c τ pr y − x τ
