 introduction 
achieving end-to-end real-time quality of service qos 
is particularly important for open distributed real-time and 
embedded dre systems that face resource constraints such 
as limited computing power and network bandwidth 
overutilization of these system resources can yield unpredictable 
and unstable behavior whereas under-utilization can yield 
excessive system cost a promising approach to meeting 
these end-to-end qos requirements effectively therefore is 
to develop and apply adaptive middleware which is 
software whose functional and qos-related properties can be 
modified either statically or dynamically static 
modifications are carried out to reduce footprint leverage 
capabilities that exist in specific platforms enable functional 
subsetting and or minimize hardware software infrastructure 
dependencies objectives of dynamic modifications include 
optimizing system responses to changing environments or 
requirements such as changing component interconnections 
power-levels cpu and network bandwidth availability 
latency jitter and workload 
in open dre systems adaptive middleware must make 
such modifications dependably i e while meeting 
stringent end-to-end qos requirements which requires the 
specification and enforcement of upper and lower bounds on 
system resource utilization to ensure effective use of 
system resources to meet these requirements we have 
developed the hybrid adaptive resource-management 
middleware hyarm which is an open-source 
distributed 
resource management middleware 
hyarm is based on hybrid control theoretic techniques 
which provide a theoretical framework for designing 
control of complex system with both continuous and discrete 
dynamics in our case study which involves a distributed 
real-time video distribution system the task of adaptive 
resource management is to control the utilization of the 
different resources whose utilizations are described by 
continuous variables we achieve this by adapting the resolution 
of the transmitted video which is modeled as a continuous 
variable and by changing the frame-rate and the 
compression which are modeled by discrete actions we have 
implemented hyarm atop the ace orb tao which 
is an implementation of the real-time corba 
specification our results show that hyarm ensures 
effective system resource utilization and end-to-end qos 
requirements of higher priority applications are met even in 
the face of fluctuations in workload

figure dre multimedia system architecture 
the architecture for our dre multimedia system is shown 
in figure and consists of the following entities data 
source video capture by uav where video is captured 
 related to subject of interest by camera s on each uav 
followed by encoding of raw video using a specific encoding 
scheme and transmitting the video to the next stage in the 
pipeline data distributor base station where the 
video is processed to remove noise followed by 
retransmission of the processed video to the next stage in the pipeline 
 sinks command and control center where the 
received video is again processed to remove noise then 
decoded and finally rendered to end user via graphical displays 
significant improvements in video encoding decoding and 
 de compression techniques have been made as a result of 
recent advances in video encoding and compression 
techniques common video compression schemes are 
mpeg mpeg- real video and mpeg- each compression 
scheme is characterized by its resource requirement e g the 
computational power to de compress the video signal and 
the network bandwidth required to transmit the compressed 
video signal properties of the compressed video such as 
resolution and frame-rate determine both the quality and the 
resource requirements of the video 
our multimedia system case study has the following 
endto-end real-time qos requirements latency 
interframe delay also know as jitter frame rate and 
picture resolution these qos requirements can be 
classified as being either hard or soft hard qos requirements 
should be met by the underlying system at all times whereas 
soft qos requirements can be missed occasionally 
for our 
case study we treat qos requirements such as latency and 
jitter as harder qos requirements and strive to meet these 
requirements at all times in contrast we treat qos 
requirements such as video frame rate and picture resolution as 
softer qos requirements and modify these video properties 
adaptively to handle dynamic changes in resource 
availabil 
although hard and soft are often portrayed as two discrete 
requirement sets in practice they are usually two ends of 
a continuum ranging from softer to harder rather than 
two disjoint points 
ity effectively 
 dre multimedia system rresources 
there are two primary types of resources in our dre 
multimedia system processors that provide 
computational power available at the uavs base stations and end 
receivers and network links that provide communication 
bandwidth between uavs base stations and end receivers 
the computing power required by the video capture and 
encoding tasks depends on dynamic factors such as speed 
of the uav speed of the subject if the subject is mobile 
and distance between uav and the subject the wireless 
network bandwidth available to transmit video captured by 
uavs to base stations also depends on the wireless 
connectivity between the uavs and the base station which in-turn 
depend on dynamic factors such as the speed of the uavs 
and the relative distance between uavs and base stations 
the bandwidth of the link between the base station and 
the end receiver is limited but more stable than the 
bandwidth of the wireless network resource requirements and 
availability of resources are subjected to dynamic changes 
two classes of applications - qos-enabled and best-effort 
- use the multimedia system infrastructure described above 
to transmit video to their respective receivers qos-enabled 
class of applications have higher priority over best-effort 
class of application in our study emergency response 
applications belong to qos-enabled and surveillance applications 
belong to best-effort class for example since a stream from 
an emergency response application is of higher importance 
than a video stream from a surveillance application it 
receives more resources end-to-end 
since resource availability significantly affects qos we use 
current resource utilization as the primary indicator of 
system performance we refer to the current level of system 
resource utilization as the system condition based on this 
definition we can classify system conditions as being either 
under over or effectively utilized 
under-utilization of system resources occurs when the 
current resource utilization is lower than the desired lower bound 
on resource utilization in this system condition residual 
system resources i e network bandwidth and 
computational power are available in large amounts after meeting 
end-to-end qos requirements of applications these 
residual resources can be used to increase the qos of the 
applications for example residual cpu and network bandwidth 
can be used to deliver better quality video e g with greater 
resolution and higher frame rate to end receivers 
over-utilization of system resources occurs when the 
current resource utilization is higher than the desired upper 
bound on resource utilization this condition can arise 
from loss of resources - network bandwidth and or 
computing power at base station end receiver or at uav - or 
may be due to an increase in resource demands by 
applications over-utilization is generally undesirable since the 
quality of the received video such as resolution and frame 
rate and timeliness properties such as latency and jitter 
are degraded and may result in an unstable and thus 
ineffective system 
effective resource utilization is the desired system 
condition since it ensures that end-to-end qos requirements of 
the uav-based multimedia system are met and utilization of 
both system resources i e network bandwidth and 
computational power are within their desired utilization bounds 
article 
section describes techniques we applied to achieve effective 
utilization even in the face of fluctuating resource 
availability and or demand 
 overview of hyarm 
this section describes the architecture of the hybrid 
adaptive resource-management middleware hyarm hyarm 
ensures efficient and predictable system performance by 
providing adaptive resource management including monitoring 
of system resources and enforcing bounds on application 
resource utilization

figure hyarm architecture 
hyarm is composed of three types of entities shown in 
figure and described below 
resource monitors observe the overall resource 
utilization for each type of resource and resource utilization per 
application in our multimedia system there are resource 
monitors for cpu utilization and network bandwidth cpu 
monitors observe the cpu resource utilization of uavs base 
station and end receivers network bandwidth monitors 
observe the network resource utilization of wireless network 
link between uavs and the base station and wired 
network link between the base station and end receivers 
the central controller maintains the system resource 
utilization below a desired bound by processing periodic 
updates it receives from resource monitors and 
modifying the execution of applications accordingly e g by 
using different execution algorithms or operating the 
application with increased decreased qos this adaptation 
process ensures that system resources are utilized efficiently and 
end-to-end application qos requirements are met in our 
multimedia system the hyarm controller determines the 
value of application parameters such as video 
compression schemes such as real video and mpeg- and or 
frame rate and picture resolution from the perspective 
of hybrid control theoretic techniques the different video 
compression schemes and frame rate form the discrete 
variables of application execution and picture resolution forms 
the continuous variables 
application adapters modify application execution 
according to parameters recommended by the controller and 
ensures that the operation of the application is in accordance 
with the recommended parameters in the current 
mplementation of hyarm the application adapter modifies the 
input parameters to the application that affect application 
qos and resource utilization - compression scheme frame 
rate and picture resolution in our future implementations 
we plan to use resource reservation mechanisms such as 
differentiated service and class-based kernel resource 
management to provision reserve network and cpu 
resources in our multimedia system the application adapter 
ensures that the video is encoded at the recommended frame 
rate and resolution using the specified compression scheme 
 applying hyarm to the multimedia 
system case study 
hyarm is built atop tao a widely used open-source 
implementation of real-time corba hyarm can be 
applied to ensure efficient predictable and adaptive resource 
management of any dre system where resource availability 
and requirements are subject to dynamic change

 performance results and 
analysis 
this section first describes the testbed that provides the 
infrastructure for our dre multimedia system which was 
used to evaluate the performance of hyarm we then 
describe our experiments and analyze the results obtained to 
empirically evaluate how hyarm behaves during 
underand over-utilization of system resources 
 overview of the hardware and software 
testbed 
our experiments were performed on the emulab testbed 
at university of utah the hardware configuration consists 
of two nodes acting as uavs one acting as base station 
and one as end receiver video from the two uavs were 
transmitted to a base station via a lan configured with 
the following properties average packet loss ratio of and 
bandwidth mbps the network bandwidth was chosen to 
be mbps since each uav in the dre multimedia system 
is allocated kbps these parameters were chosen to 
emulate an unreliable wireless network with limited bandwidth 
between the uavs and the base station from the base 
station the video was retransmitted to the end receiver via a 
reliable wireline link of mbps bandwidth with no packet 
loss 
the hardware configuration of all the nodes was chosen as 
follows mhz intel pentium iii processor mb 
physical memory intel etherexpress pro mbps ethernet 
ports and gb hard drive a real-time version of linux 
- timesys linux net based on redhat linux 
 was used as the operating system for all nodes the 
following software packages were also used for our experiments 
ffmpeg -pre which is an open-source library http 
 www ffmpeg sourceforge net download php that 
compresses video into mpeg- mpeg- real video and many 
other video formats iftop which is an 
opensource library http www ex-parrot com ∼pdw iftop 
we used for monitoring network activity and bandwidth 
utilization ace tao which is an 
opensource http www dre vanderbilt edu tao 
implementation of the real-time corba specification upon which 
hyarm is built tao provides the corba audio video 
 a v streaming service that we use to transmit the video 
from the uavs to end receivers via the base station 
 experiment configuration 
our experiment consisted of two emulated uavs that 
simultaneously send video to the base station using the 
experimentation setup described in section at the base 
station video was retransmitted to the end receivers without 
any modifications where it was stored to a file each uav 
hosted two applications one qos-enabled application 
 emergency response and one best-effort application 
 surveillance within each uav computational power is shared 
between the applications while the network bandwidth is 
shared among all applications 
to evaluate the qos provided by hyarm we monitored 
cpu utilization at the two uavs and network bandwidth 
utilization between the uav and the base station cpu 
resource utilization was not monitored at the base station and 
the end receiver since they performed no 
computationallyintensive operations the resource utilization of the mpbs 
physical link between the base station and the end receiver 
does not affect qos of applications and is not monitored by 
hyarm since it is nearly times the mb bandwidth 
of the lan between the uavs and the base station the 
experiment also monitors properties of the video that affect 
the qos of the applications such as latency jitter frame 
rate and resolution 
the set point on resource utilization for each resource was 
specified at which is the upper bound typically 
recommended by scheduling techniques such as rate monotonic 
algorithm since studies have shown that human eyes 
can perceive delays more than ms we use this as the 
upper bound on jitter of the received video qos 
requirements for each class of application is specified during system 
initialization and is shown in table 
 empirical results and analysis 
this section presents the results obtained from running 
the experiment described in section on our dre 
multimedia system testbed we used system resource utilization 
as a metric to evaluate the adaptive resource management 
capabilities of hyarm under varying input work loads we 
also used application qos as a metric to evaluate hyarm s 
capabilities to support end-to-end qos requirements of the 
various classes of applications in the dre multimedia 
system we analyze these results to explain the significant 
differences in system performance and application qos 
comparison of system performance is decomposed into 
comparison of resource utilization and application qos for 
system resource utilization we compare network 
bandwidth utilization of the local area network and cpu 
utilization at the two uav nodes for application qos we 
compare mean values of video parameters including 
picture resolution frame rate latency and jitter 
comparison of resource utilization over-utilization 
of system resources in dre systems can yield an unstable 
system in contrast under-utilization of system resources 
increases system cost figure and figure compare the 
system resource utilization with and without hyarm 
figure shows that hyarm maintains system utilization close 
to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in 
input work load by transmitting video of higher or lower qos 
for qos-enabled or best-effort class of applications during 
over or under utilization of system resources 
figure shows that without hyarm network 
utilization was as high as during increase in workload 
conditions which is greater than the utilization set point of 
by as a result of over-utilization of resources qos of 
the received video such as average latency and jitter was 
affected significantly without hyarm system resources 
were either under-utilized or over-utilized both of which 
are undesirable in contrast with hyarm system resource 
utilization is always close to the desired set point even 
during fluctuations in application workload during 
sudden fluctuation in application workload system conditions 
may be temporarily undesirable but are restored to the 
desired condition within several sampling periods temporary 
over-utilization of resources is permissible in our multimedia 
system since the quality of the video may be degraded for 
a short period of time though application qos will be 
degraded significantly if poor quality video is transmitted for 
a longer period of time

rate of the received video respectively table shows that 
hyarm increases the resolution and frame video of 
qosenabled applications but decreases the resolution and frame 
rate of best effort applications during over utilization of 
system resources resolution and frame rate of lower priority 
applications are reduced to adapt to fluctuations in 
application workload and to maintain the utilization of resources 
at the specified set point 
it can be seen from figure and figure that hyarm 
reduces the latency and jitter of the received video 
significantly these figures show that the qos of qos-enabled 
applications is greatly improved by hyarm although 
application parameters such as frame rate and resolutions 
which affect the soft qos requirements of best-effort 
applications may be compromised the hard qos requirements 
such as latency and jitter of all applications are met 
hyarm responds to fluctuation in resource availability 
and or demand by constant monitoring of resource 
utilization as shown in figure when resources utilization 
increases above the desired set point hyarm lowers the 
utilization by reducing the qos of best-effort applications this 
adaptation ensures that enough resources are available for 
qos-enabled applications to meet their qos needs 
figures and show that the values of latency and jitter of 
the received video of the system with hyarm are nearly half 
of the corresponding value of the system without hyarm 
with hyarm values of these parameters are well below 
the specified bounds whereas without hyarm these value 
are significantly above the specified bounds due to 
overutilization of the network bandwidth which leads to network 
congestion and results in packet loss hyarm avoids this 
by reducing video parameters such as resolution frame-rate 
and or modifying the compression scheme used to compress 
the video 
our conclusions from analyzing the results described above 
are that applying adaptive middleware via hybrid control to 
dre system helps to improve application qos 
increase system resource utilization and provide better 
predictability lower latency and inter-frame delay to 
qosenabled applications these improvements are achieved largely 
due to monitoring of system resource utilization efficient 
system workload management and adaptive resource 
provisioning by means of hyarm s network cpu resource 
monitors application adapter and central controller 
respectively 
 related work 
a number of control theoretic approaches have been 
applied to dre systems recently these techniques aid in 
overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches 
that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly 
and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly 
to change a survey of these techniques is presented in 
one such approach is feedback control scheduling fcs 
 fcs algorithms dynamically adjust resource allocation 
by means of software feedback control loops fcs 
algorithms are modeled and designed using rigorous 
controltheoretic methodologies these algorithms provide robust 
and analytical performance assurances despite uncertainties 
in resource availability and or demand although existing 
fcs algorithms have shown promise these algorithms often 
assume that the system has continuous control variable s 
that can continuously be adjusted while this assumption 
holds for certain classes of systems there are many classes 
of dre systems such as avionics and total-ship computing 
environments that only support a finite a priori set of 
discrete configurations the control variables in such systems 
are therefore intrinsically discrete 
hyarm handles both continuous control variables such 
as picture resolution and discrete control variable such as 
discrete set of frame rates hyarm can therefore be applied 
to system that support continuous and or discrete set of 
control variables the dre multimedia system as described 
in section is an example dre system that offers both 
continuous picture resolution and discrete set frame-rate of 
control variables these variables are modified by hyarm 
to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved 
application qos

table comparison of video quality 
many distributed real-time and embedded dre systems 
demand end-to-end quality of service qos enforcement 
from their underlying platforms to operate correctly these 
systems increasingly run in open environments where 
resource availability is subject to dynamic change to meet 
end-to-end qos in dynamic environments dre systems can 
benefit from an adaptive middleware that monitors system 
resources performs efficient application workload 
management and enables efficient resource provisioning for 
executing applications 
this paper described hyarm an adaptive middleware 
that provides effective resource management to dre 
systems hyarm employs hybrid control techniques to 
provide the adaptive middleware capabilities such as resource 
monitoring and application adaptation that are key to 
providing the dynamic resource management capabilities for 
open dre systems we employed hyarm to a 
representative dre multimedia system that is implemented using 
real-time corba and corba a v streaming service 
we evaluated the performance of hyarm in a system 
composed of three distributed resources and two classes of 
applications with two applications each our empirical 
results indicate that hyarm ensures efficient resource 
utilization by maintaining the resource utilization of system 
resources within the specified utilization bounds qos 
requirements of qos-enabled applications are met at all times 
overall hyarm ensures efficient predictable and adaptive
