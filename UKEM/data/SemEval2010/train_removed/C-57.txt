abstract 
we define a new class of games congestion games with 
loaddependent failures cglfs which generalizes the well-known 
class of congestion games by incorporating the issue of 
resource failures into congestion games in a cglf agents 
share a common set of resources where each resource has a 
cost and a probability of failure each agent chooses a 
subset of the resources for the execution of his task in order to 
maximize his own utility the utility of an agent is the 
difference between his benefit from successful task completion 
and the sum of the costs over the resources he uses cglfs 
possess two novel features it is the first model to 
incorporate failures into congestion settings which results in a 
strict generalization of congestion games in addition it is 
the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such 
framework where the failure probability of each resource 
depends on the number of agents selecting this resource 
although as we show cglfs do not admit a potential 
function and in general do not have a pure strategy nash 
equilibrium our main theorem proves the existence of a pure 
strategy nash equilibrium in every cglf with identical 
resources and nondecreasing cost functions

 introduction 
we study the effects of resource failures in congestion 
settings this study is motivated by a variety of situations 
in multi-agent systems with unreliable components such as 
machines computers etc we define a model for congestion 
games with load-dependent failures cglfs which provides 
simple and natural description of such situations in this 
model we are given a finite set of identical resources service 
providers where each element possesses a failure 
probability describing the probability of unsuccessful completion of 
its assigned tasks as a nondecreasing function of its 
congestion there is a fixed number of agents each having 
a task which can be carried out by any of the resources 
for reliability reasons each agent may decide to assign his 
task simultaneously to a number of resources thus the 
congestion on the resources is not known in advance but 
is strategy-dependent each resource is associated with a 
cost which is a nonnegative function of the congestion 
experienced by this resource the objective of each agent is to 
maximize his own utility which is the difference between his 
benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the 
costs over the set of resources he uses the benefits of the 
agents from successful completion of their tasks are allowed 
to vary across the agents 
the resource cost function describes the cost suffered by 
an agent for selecting that resource as a function of the 
number of agents who have selected it thus it is natural 
to assume that these functions are nonnegative in addition 
in many real-life applications of our model the resource cost 
functions have a special structure in particular they can 
monotonically increase or decrease with the number of the 
users depending on the context the former case is 
motivated by situations where high congestion on a resource 
causes longer delay in its assigned tasks execution and as 
a result the cost of utilizing this resource might be higher 
a typical example of such situation is as follows assume 
we need to deliver an important package since there is no 
guarantee that a courier will reach the destination in time 
we might send several couriers to deliver the same package 
the time required by each courier to deliver the package 
increases with the congestion on his way in addition the 
payment to a courier is proportional to the time he spends 
in delivering the package thus the payment to the courier 
increases when the congestion increases the latter case 
 decreasing cost functions describes situations where a group 
of agents using a particular resource have an opportunity to 
share its cost among the group s members or the cost of 
 
using a resource decreases with the number of users 
according to some marketing policy 
our results 
we show that cglfs and in particular cglfs with 
nondecreasing cost functions do not admit a 
potential function therefore the cglf model can not be 
reduced to congestion games nevertheless if the 
failure probabilities are constant do not depend on the 
congestion then a potential function is guaranteed to 
exist 
we show that cglfs and in particular cglfs with 
decreasing cost functions do not possess pure 
strategy nash equilibria however as we show in our main 
result there exists a pure strategy nash 
equilibrium in any cglf with nondecreasing cost 
functions 
related work 
our model extends the well-known class of congestion games 
 in a congestion game every agent has to choose from a 
finite set of resources where the utility or cost of an agent 
from using a particular resource depends on the number of 
agents using it and his total utility cost is the sum of 
the utilities costs obtained from the resources he uses an 
important property of these games is the existence of pure 
strategy nash equilibria monderer and shapley 
introduced the notions of potential function and potential game 
and proved that the existence of a potential function implies 
the existence of a pure strategy nash equilibrium they 
observed that rosenthal proved his theorem on 
congestion games by constructing a potential function hence 
every congestion game is a potential game moreover they 
showed that every finite potential game is isomorphic to a 
congestion game hence the classes of finite potential games 
and congestion games coincide 
congestion games have been extensively studied and 
generalized in particular leyton-brown and tennenholtz 
extended the class of congestion games to the class of 
localeffect games in a local-effect game each agent s payoff is 
effected not only by the number of agents who have chosen 
the same resources as he has chosen but also by the number 
of agents who have chosen neighboring resources in a given 
graph structure monderer dealt with another type of 
generalization of congestion games in which the resource 
cost functions are player-specific ps-congestion games he 
defined ps-congestion games of type q q-congestion games 
where q is a positive number and showed that every game 
in strategic form is a q-congestion game for some q 
playerspecific resource cost functions were discussed for the first 
time by milchtaich he showed that simple and 
strategysymmetric ps-congestion games are not potential games 
but always possess a pure strategy nash equilibrium 
pscongestion games were generalized to weighted congestion 
games or id-congestion games in which the 
resource cost functions are not only player-specific but also 
depend on the identity of the users of the resource 
ackermann et al showed that weighted congestion games 
admit pure strategy nash equilibria if the strategy space of 
each player consists of the bases of a matroid on the set of 
resources 
much of the work on congestion games has been inspired 
by the fact that every such game has a pure strategy nash 
equilibrium in particular fabrikant et al studied 
the computational complexity of finding pure strategy nash 
equilibria in congestion games intensive study has also 
been devoted to quantify the inefficiency of equilibria in 
congestion games koutsoupias and papadimitriou 
proposed the worst-case ratio of the social welfare achieved 
by a nash equilibrium and by a socially optimal strategy 
profile dubbed the price of anarchy as a measure of the 
performance degradation caused by lack of coordination 
christodoulou and koutsoupias considered the price of 
anarchy of pure equilibria in congestion games with linear 
cost functions roughgarden and tardos used this 
approach to study the cost of selfish routing in networks with 
a continuum of users 
however the above settings do not take into 
consideration the possibility that resources may fail to execute their 
assigned tasks in the computer science context of 
congestion games where the alternatives of concern are machines 
computers communication lines etc which are obviously 
prone to failures this issue should not be ignored 
penn polukarov and tennenholtz were the first to 
incorporate the issue of failures into congestion settings 
they introduced a class of congestion games with failures 
 cgfs and proved that these games while not being 
isomorphic to congestion games always possess nash equilibria 
in pure strategies the cgf-model significantly differs from 
ours in a cgf the authors considered the delay associated 
with successful task completion where the delay for an agent 
is the minimum of the delays of his successful attempts and 
the aim of each agent is to minimize his expected delay in 
contrast with the cgf-model in our model we consider the 
total cost of the utilized resources where each agent wishes 
to maximize the difference between his benefit from a 
successful task completion and the sum of his costs over the 
resources he uses 
the above differences imply that cgfs and cglfs 
possess different properties in particular if in our model the 
resource failure probabilities were constant and known in 
advance then a potential function would exist this however 
does not hold for cgfs in cgfs the failure probabilities 
are constant but there is no potential function 
furthermore the procedures proposed by the authors in for 
the construction of a pure strategy nash equilibrium are 
not valid in our model even in the simple agent-symmetric 
case where all agents have the same benefit from successful 
completion of their tasks 
our work provides the first model of congestion settings 
with resource failures which considers the sum of 
congestiondependent costs over utilized resources and therefore does 
not extend the cgf-model but rather generalizes the classic 
model of congestion games moreover it is the first model 
to consider load-dependent failures in the above context 
 
organization 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 
we define our model in section we present our results 
in we show that cglfs in general do not have pure 
strategy nash equilibria in we focus on cglfs with 
nondecreasing cost functions nondecreasing cglfs we 
show that these games do not admit a potential function 
however in our main result we show the existence of pure 
strategy nash equilibria in nondecreasing cglfs section 
 is devoted to a short discussion many of the proofs are 
omitted from this conference version of the paper and will 
appear in the full version 
 the model 
the scenarios considered in this work consist of a finite set 
of agents where each agent has a task that can be carried 
out by any element of a set of identical resources service 
providers the agents simultaneously choose a subset of 
the resources in order to perform their tasks and their aim 
is to maximize their own expected payoff as described in 
the sequel 
let n be a set of n agents n ∈ n and let m be a set 
of m resources m ∈ n agent i ∈ n chooses a 
strategy σi ∈ σi which is a potentially empty subset of the 
resources that is σi is the power set of the set of 
resources σi p m given a subset s ⊆ n of the agents 
the set of strategy combinations of the members of s is 
denoted by σs ×i∈sσi and the set of strategy 
combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted by 
σ−s σ−s σn s ×i∈n sσi the set of pure strategy 
profiles of all the agents is denoted by σ σ σn 
each resource is associated with a cost c · and a 
failure probability f · each of which depends on the 
number of agents who use this resource we assume that the 
failure probabilities of the resources are independent let 
σ σ σn ∈ σ be a pure strategy profile the 
 m-dimensional congestion vector that corresponds to σ is 
hσ

e e∈m where hσ

˛ i ∈ n e ∈ σi 
˛ 
˛ the 
failure probability of a resource e is a monotone nondecreasing 
function f n → of the congestion 
experienced by e the cost of utilizing resource e is a function 
c n → r of the congestion experienced by e 
the outcome for agent i ∈ n is denoted by xi ∈ s f 
where s and f respectively indicate whether the task 
execution succeeded or failed we say that the execution of 
agent s i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully 
completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him 
the benefit of agent i from his outcome xi is denoted by 
vi xi where vi s vi a given nonnegative value and 
vi f 
the utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his 
outcome xi ui σ xi is the difference between his benefit from 
the outcome vi xi and the sum of the costs of the 
resources he has used

 pure strategy nash equilibria 
in cglfs 
in this section we present our results on cglfs we 
investigate the property of the non- existence of pure strategy 
nash equilibria in these games we show that this class of 
games does not in general possess pure strategy equilibria 
nevertheless if the resource cost functions are 
nondecreasing then such equilibria are guaranteed to exist despite the 
non-existence of a potential function 
 decreasing cost functions 
we start by showing that the class of cglfs and in 
particular the subclass of cglfs with decreasing cost 
functions does not in general possess nash equilibria in pure 
strategies 
consider a cglf with two agents n and two 
resources m e e the cost function of each resource 
is given by c x 
xx where x ∈ and the failure 
probabilities are f and f the benefits 
of the agents from successful task completion are v

table example for non-existence of pure strategy nash 
equilibria in cglfs 
it can be easily seen that for every pure strategy profile σ 
in this game there exist an agent i and a strategy σi ∈ σi 
such that ui σ−i σi ui σ that is every pure strategy 
profile in this game is not in equilibrium 
however if the cost functions in a given cglf do not 
decrease in the number of users then as we show in the 
main result of this paper a pure strategy nash equilibrium 
is guaranteed to exist 
 
 nondecreasing cost functions 
this section focuses on the subclass of cglfs with 
nondecreasing cost functions henceforth nondecreasing cglfs 
we show that nondecreasing cglfs do not in general 
admit a potential function therefore these games are not 
congestion games nevertheless we prove that all such games 
possess pure strategy nash equilibria 
 the non- existence of a potential function 
recall that monderer and shapley introduced the 
notions of potential function and potential game where 
potential game is defined to be a game that possesses a potential 
function a potential function is a real-valued function over 
the set of pure strategy profiles with the property that the 
gain or loss of an agent shifting to another strategy while 
the other agents strategies are kept unchanged equals to 
the corresponding increment of the potential function the 
authors showed that the classes of finite potential games 
and congestion games coincide 
here we show that the class of cglfs and in particular 
the subclass of nondecreasing cglfs does not admit a 
potential function and therefore is not included in the class of 
congestion games however for the special case of constant 
failure probabilities a potential function is guaranteed to 
exist to prove these statements we use the following 
characterization of potential games 
a path in σ is a sequence τ σ 
→ σ 
→ · · · such 
that for every k ≥ there exists a unique agent say agent 
i such that σk 
 σk− 
−i σi for some σi σk− 
i in σi a 
finite path τ σ 
→ σ 
→ · · · → σk 
 is closed if σ 
 σk 
 
it is a simple closed path if in addition σl 
 σk 
for every 
 ≤ l k ≤ k − the length of a simple closed path is 
defined to be the number of distinct points in it that is the 
length of τ σ 
→ σ 
→ · · · → σk 
 is k 
theorem let g be a game in strategic form with 
a vector u u un of utility functions for a finite 
path τ σ 
→ σ 
→ · · · → σk 
 let u τ 
pk 
k uik σk 
 − 
uik σk− 
 where ik is the unique deviator at step k then 
g is a potential game if and only if u τ for every 
simple closed path τ of length 
load-dependent failures 
based on theorem we present the following 
counterexample that demonstrates the non-existence of a potential 
function in cglfs 
we consider the following agent-symmetric game g in 
which two agents n wish to assign a task to two 
resources m e e the benefit from a successful task 
completion of each agent equals v and the failure 
probability function strictly increases with the congestion consider 
the simple closed path of length which is formed by 
α ∅ e β e e 
γ e e e δ ∅ e e

 − f 
´ 
v − c 
 e u − f v − c u − f v − c 
u − f v − c u − f f v − c − c 
table example for non-existence of potentials in cglfs 
therefore 
u α − u β u β − u γ u γ − u δ 
 u δ − u α v − f f − f 
thus by theorem nondecreasing cglfs do not 
admit potentials as a result they are not congestion games 
however as presented in the next section the special case 
in which the failure probabilities are constant always 
possesses a potential function 
constant failure probabilities 
we show below that cglfs with constant failure 
probabilities always possess a potential function this follows from 
the fact that the expected benefit revenue of each agent in 
this case does not depend on the choices of the other agents 
in addition for each agent the sum of the costs over his 
chosen subset of resources equals the payoff of an agent 
choosing the same strategy in the corresponding congestion game 
assume we are given a game g with constant failure 
probabilities let τ α → β → γ → δ → α be an arbitrary 
simple closed path of length let i and j denote the active 
agents deviators in τ and z ∈ σ− i j be a fixed 
strategy profile of the other agents let α xi xj z β 
 yi xj z γ yi yj z δ xi yj z where xi yi ∈ σi 
and xj yj ∈ σj then

 as 
a sum of a telescope series the remaining sum equals by 
applying theorem to congestion games which are known 
to possess a potential function thus by theorem g is a 
potential game 
 
we note that the above result holds also for the more 
general settings with non-identical resources having 
different failure probabilities and cost functions and general cost 
functions not necessarily monotone and or nonnegative 
 the existence of a pure strategy nash 
equilibrium 
in the previous section we have shown that cglfs and 
in particular nondecreasing cglfs do not admit a 
potential function but this fact in general does not contradict 
the existence of an equilibrium in pure strategies in this 
section we present and prove the main result of this 
paper theorem which shows the existence of pure strategy 
nash equilibria in nondecreasing cglfs 
theorem every nondecreasing cglf possesses a nash 
equilibrium in pure strategies 
the proof of theorem is based on lemmas and 
 which are presented in the sequel we start with some 
definitions and observations that are needed for their proofs 
in particular we present the notions of a- d- and s-stability 
and show that a strategy profile is in equilibrium if and only 
if it is a- d- and s- stable furthermore we prove the 
existence of such a profile in any given nondecreasing cglf 
definition for any strategy profile σ ∈ σ and for any 
agent i ∈ n the operation of adding precisely one resource 
to his strategy σi is called an a-move of i from σ 
similarly the operation of dropping a single resource is called a 
d-move and the operation of switching one resource with 
another is called an s-move 
clearly if agent i deviates from strategy σi to strategy σi 
by applying a single a- d- or s-move then max σi σi 
 σi σi and vice versa if max σi σi σi σi 
 then σi is obtained from σi by applying exactly one such 
move for simplicity of exposition for any pair of sets a 
and b let µ a b max a b b a 
the following lemma implies that any strategy profile in 
which no agent wishes unilaterally to apply a single a- 
dor s-move is a nash equilibrium more precisely we show 
that if there exists an agent who benefits from a unilateral 
deviation from a given strategy profile then there exists a 
single a- d- or s-move which is profitable for him as well 
lemma given a nondecreasing cglf let σ ∈ σ be a 
strategy profile which is not in equilibrium and let i ∈ n 
such that ∃xi ∈ σi for which ui σ−i xi ui σ then 
there exists yi ∈ σi such that ui σ−i yi ui σ and µ yi σi 
 
therefore to prove the existence of a pure strategy nash 
equilibrium it suffices to look for a strategy profile for which 
no agent wishes to unilaterally apply an a- d- or s-move 
based on the above observation we define a- d- and 
sstability as follows 
definition a strategy profile σ is said to be a-stable 
 resp d-stable s-stable if there are no agents with a 
profitable a- resp d- s- move from σ similarly we 
define a strategy profile σ to be ds-stable if there are no 
agents with a profitable d- or s-move from σ 
the set of all ds-stable strategy profiles is denoted by 
σ 
 obviously the profile ∅ ∅ is ds-stable so σ 
is not empty our goal is to find a ds-stable profile for 
which no profitable a-move exists implying this profile is 
in equilibrium to describe how we achieve this we define 
the notions of light heavy resources and nearly- even 
strategy profiles which play a central role in the proof of 
our main result 
definition given a strategy profile σ resource e is 
called σ-light if hσ 
e ∈ arg mine∈m hσ 
e and σ-heavy otherwise 
a strategy profile σ with no heavy resources will be termed 
even a strategy profile σ satisfying hσ 
e − hσ 
e ≤ for all 
e e ∈ m will be termed nearly-even 
obviously every even strategy profile is nearly-even in 
addition in a nearly-even strategy profile all heavy resources 
 if exist have the same congestion we also observe that the 
profile ∅ ∅ is even and ds-stable so the subset of 
even ds-stable strategy profiles is not empty 
based on the above observations we define two types of 
an a-move that are used in the sequel suppose σ ∈ σ 
is a nearly-even ds-stable strategy profile for each agent 
i ∈ n let ei ∈ arg mine∈m σi hσ 
e that is ei is a 
lightest resource not chosen previously by i then if there 
exists any profitable a-move for agent i then the a-move 
with ei is profitable for i as well this is since if agent i 
wishes to unilaterally add a resource say a ∈ m σi then 
ui σ−i σi ∪ a ui σ hence

if no agent wishes to change his strategy in this 
manner i e ui σ ≥ ui σ−i σi ∪ ei for all i ∈ n then by the 
above ui σ ≥ ui σ−i σi ∪ a for all i ∈ n and a ∈ m σi 
hence σ is a-stable and by lemma σ is a nash 
equilibrium strategy profile otherwise let n σ denote the subset 
of all agents for which there exists ei such that a unilateral 
addition of ei is profitable let a ∈ arg minei i∈n σ hσ 
ei 
 let 
also i ∈ n σ be the agent for which ei a if a is σ-light 
then let σ σ−i σi ∪ a in this case we say that σ is 
obtained from σ by a one-step addition of resource a and a 
is called an added resource if a is σ-heavy then there exists 
a σ-light resource b and an agent j such that a ∈ σj and 
b ∈ σj then let σ 
 
σ− i j σi ∪ a σj a ∪ b 
´ 
 
in this case we say that σ is obtained from σ by a two-step 
addition of resource b and b is called an added resource 
we notice that in both cases the congestion of each 
resource in σ is the same as in σ except for the added 
resource for which its congestion in σ increased by thus 
since the added resource is σ-light and σ is nearly-even σ 
is nearly-even then the following lemma implies the 
sstability of σ 
 
lemma in a nondecreasing cglf every nearly-even 
strategy profile is s-stable 
coupled with lemma the following lemma shows that 
if σ is a nearly-even and ds-stable strategy profile and σ is 
obtained from σ by a one- or two-step addition of resource 
a then the only potential cause for a non-ds-stability of σ 
is the existence of an agent k ∈ n with σk σk who wishes 
to drop the added resource a 
lemma let σ be a nearly-even ds-stable strategy 
profile of a given nondecreasing cglf and let σ be obtained 
from σ by a one- or two-step addition of resource a then 
there are no profitable d-moves for any agent i ∈ n with 
σi σi for an agent i ∈ n with σi σi the only possible 
profitable d-move if exists is to drop the added resource a 
we are now ready to prove our main result - theorem 
 let us briefly describe the idea behind the proof by 
lemma it suffices to prove the existence of a strategy 
profile which is a- d- and s-stable we start with the set 
of even and ds-stable strategy profiles which is obviously 
not empty in this set we consider the subset of strategy 
profiles with maximum congestion and maximum sum of the 
agents utilities assuming on the contrary that every 
dsstable profile admits a profitable a-move we show the 
existence of a strategy profile x in the above subset such that a 
 one-step addition of some resource a to x results in a 
dsstable strategy then by a finite series of one- or two-step 
addition operations we obtain an even ds-stable strategy 
profile with strictly higher congestion on the resources 
contradicting the choice of x the full proof is presented below 
proof of theorem let σ 
⊆ σ 
be the subset of 
all even ds-stable strategy profiles observe that since 
 ∅ ∅ is an even ds-stable strategy profile then σ 
is not empty and minσ∈σ

˛ e ∈ m e is σ−heavy

then σ 
could also be defined as

with hσ 
being the common congestion 
now let σ

those profiles with maximum congestion on the resources 
that is

 arg max 
σ∈σ

consider first the simple case in which maxσ∈σ hσ 
 
obviously in this case σ

 x ∅ ∅ 
we show below that by performing a finite series of 
 onestep addition operations on x we obtain an even 
dsstable strategy profile y with higher congestion that is with 
hy 
 hx 
 in contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 let z ∈ σ 
be 
a nearly-even not necessarily even ds-stable profile such 
that mine∈m hz 
e and note that the profile x satisfies 
the above conditions let n z be the subset of agents for 
which a profitable a-move exists and let i ∈ n z 
obviously there exists a z-light resource a such that ui z−i zi ∪ 
 a ui z otherwise arg mine∈m hz 
e ⊆ zi in 
contradiction to mine∈m hz 
e consider the strategy profile 
z z−i zi ∪ a which is obtained from z by a one-step 
addition of resource a by agent i since z is nearly-even and 
a is z-light we can easily see that z is nearly-even then 
lemma implies that z is s-stable since i is the only agent 
using resource a in z by lemma no profitable d-moves 
are available thus z is a ds-stable strategy profile 
therefore since the number of resources is finite there is a finite 
series of one-step addition operations on x ∅ ∅ that 
leads to strategy profile y ∈ σ 
with hy 
 hx 
 in 
contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 
we turn now to consider the other case where maxσ∈σ hσ 
≥ in this case we select from σ 
a strategy profile x 
as described below and use it to contradict our contrary 
assumption specifically we show that there exists x ∈ σ 
such that for all j ∈ n 
vjf hx 
 xj − 
≥ 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
let x be a strategy profile which is obtained from x by 
a one-step addition of some resource a ∈ m by some 
agent i ∈ n x note that x is nearly-even then 
is derived from and essentially equivalent to the inequality 
uj x ≥ uj x−j xj a for all a ∈ xj that is after 
performing an a-move with a by i there is no profitable 
d-move with a then by lemmas and x is ds-stable 
following the same lines as above we construct a procedure 
that initializes at x and achieves a strategy profile y ∈ σ 
with hy 
 hx 
 in contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 
now let us confirm the existence of x ∈ σ 
that 
satisfies let x ∈ σ 
and let m x be the subset of all 
resources for which there exists a profitable one-step 
addition first we show that holds for all j ∈ n such that 
xj ∩m x ∅ that is for all those agents with one of their 
resources being desired by another agent 
let a ∈ m x and let x be the strategy profile that is 
obtained from x by the one-step addition of a by agent i 
assume on the contrary that there is an agent j with a ∈ xj 
such that 
vjf hx 
 xj − 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
let x x−j xj a below we demonstrate that x 
is a ds-stable strategy profile and since x and x 
correspond to the same congestion vector we conclude that x 
lies in σ 
 in addition we show that un x un x 
contradicting the fact that x ∈ σ 
 
to show that x ∈ σ 
we note that x is an even strategy 
profile and thus no s-moves may be performed for x in 
addition since hx 
 hx 
and x ∈ σ 
 there are no profitable 
d-moves for any agent k i j it remains to show that 
there are no profitable d-moves for agents i and j as well 
 
since ui x ui x we get 
vif hx 
 xi 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
⇒ vif hx 
 xi − 
 vif hx 
 xi 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
which implies ui x ui x−i xi b for all b ∈ xi 
thus there are no profitable d-moves for agent i by the 
ds-stability of x for agent j and for all b ∈ xj we have 
uj x ≥ uj x−j xj b ⇒ vjf hx 
 xj − 
≥ 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
then 
vjf hx 
 xj − 
 vjf hx 
 xj 
 vjf hx 
 xj − 
≥ 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
⇒ uj x uj x−j xj b for all b ∈ xi therefore x 
is ds-stable and lies in σ 
 
to show that un x the group utility of x satisfies 
un x un x we note that hx 
 hx 
 and thus uk x 
uk x for all k ∈ n i j therefore we have to show 
that ui x uj x ui x uj x or ui x − ui x 
uj x − uj x observe that 
ui x ui x ⇒ vif hx 
 xi 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
and 
uj x uj x ⇒ vjf hx 
 xj − 
 
c hx 
 
 − f hx 
 
which yields 
vif hx 
 xi 
 vjf hx 
 xj − 
 
thus ui x − ui x 
 
 
 − f hx

 uj x − uj x 
therefore x lies in σ 
and satisfies un x un x in 
contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 
hence if x ∈ σ 
then holds for all j ∈ n such that 
xj ∩m x ∅ now let us see that there exists x ∈ σ 
such 
that holds for all the agents for that choose an agent 
i ∈ arg mink∈n vif hx 
 xk 
 if there exists a ∈ xi ∩ m x 
then i satisfies implying by the choice of agent i that 
the above obviously yields the correctness of for any 
agent k ∈ n otherwise if no resource in xi lies in m x 
then let a ∈ xi and a ∈ m x since a ∈ xi a ∈ xi 
and hx 
a hx 
a then there exists agent j such that a ∈ xj 
and a ∈ xj one can easily check that the strategy 
profile x 
 
x− i j xi a ∪ a xj a ∪ a 
´ 
lies 
in σ 
 thus x satisfies for agent i and therefore for 
any agent k ∈ n 
now let x ∈ σ 
satisfy we show below that by 
performing a finite series of one- and two-step addition 
operations on x we can achieve a strategy profile y that lies 
in σ 
 such that hy

 in contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 let 
z ∈ σ

strategy profile such that

for all i ∈ n and for all z-light resource b ∈ zi we note that 
for profile x ∈ σ 
⊆ σ 
 with all resources being x-light 
conditions and are equivalent let z be obtained 
from z by a one- or two-step addition of a z-light resource 
a obviously z is nearly-even in addition hz 
e ≥ hz 
e for 
all e ∈ m and mine∈m hz 
e ≥ mine∈m hz 
e to complete the 
proof we need to show that z is ds-stable and in addition 
that if mine∈m hz 
e mine∈m hz 
e then z has property 
the ds-stability of z follows directly from lemmas and 
and from with respect to z it remains to prove property 
 for z with mine∈m hz 
e mine∈m hz 
e using with 
respect to z for any agent k with zk zk and for any

as required now let us consider the rest of the agents 
assume z is obtained by the one-step addition of a by agent 
i in this case i is the only agent with zi zi the required 
property for agent i follows directly from ui z ui z in 
the case of a two-step addition let z 
 
z− i j zi ∪ b

and note that since hz

particular for all z -light resources then 
c hz

 − f hz 
b

for any z -light resource e 
 
now since hz

thus since the number of resources is finite there is a finite 
series of one- and two-step addition operations on x that 
leads to strategy profile y ∈ σ 
with hy

 in 
contradiction to x ∈ σ 
 this completes the proof 
 discussion 
in this paper we introduce and investigate congestion 
settings with unreliable resources in which the probability of a 
resource s failure depends on the congestion experienced by 
this resource we defined a class of congestion games with 
load-dependent failures cglfs which generalizes the 
wellknown class of congestion games we study the existence of 
pure strategy nash equilibria and potential functions in the 
presented class of games we show that these games do not 
in general possess pure strategy equilibria nevertheless 
if the resource cost functions are nondecreasing then such 
equilibria are guaranteed to exist despite the non-existence 
of a potential function 
the cglf-model can be modified to the case where the 
agents pay only for non-faulty resources they selected both 
the model discussed in this paper and the modified one are 
reasonable in the full version we will show that the 
modified model leads to similar results in particular we can 
show the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium for 
nondecreasing cglfs also in the modified model 
in future research we plan to consider various extensions 
of cglfs in particular we plan to consider cglfs where 
the resources may have different costs and failure 
probabilities as well as cglfs in which the resource failure 
probabilities are mutually dependent in addition it is of 
interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of 
pure strategy nash equilibrium as well as discuss the social 
 in efficiency of the equilibria
