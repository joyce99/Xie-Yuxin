abstract 
bids submitted in auctions are usually treated as enforceable 
commitments in most bidding and auction theory literature in reality 
bidders often withdraw winning bids before the transaction when 
it is in their best interests to do so given a bid withdrawal in a 
combinatorial auction finding an alternative repair solution of 
adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the 
remaining winning bids in the original solution may be difficult or even 
impossible we have called this the bid-taker s exposure 
problem when faced with such unreliable bidders it is preferable for 
the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that 
is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible 
withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue 
in this paper we propose an approach to addressing the 
bidtaker s exposure problem firstly we use the weighted super 
solutions framework from the field of constraint programming 
to solve the problem of finding a robust solution a weighted super 
solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn 
can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by 
making limited changes secondly we introduce an auction model 
that uses a form of leveled commitment contract which 
we have called mutual bid bonds to improve solution reparability 
by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker we 
then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in 
different economically motivated auction scenarios for different 
constraints on the revenue of repair solutions we also demonstrate 
experimentally that fewer winning bids partake in robust solutions 
thereby reducing any associated overhead in dealing with extra 
bidders robust solutions can also provide a means of selectively 
discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner

 introduction 
a combinatorial auction ca provides an efficient means of 
allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst bidders whose 
perceived valuations for combinations of items differ such 
auctions are gaining in popularity and there is a proliferation in their 
usage across various industries such as telecoms b b procurement 
and transportation 
revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such 
auctions but another desirable attribute is solution robustness in terms 
of combinatorial auctions a robust solution is one that can 
withstand bid withdrawal a break by making changes easily to form 
a repair solution of adequate revenue a brittle solution to a ca 
is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if 
a winning bid is withdrawn in such situations the bid-taker may 
be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other 
bidders these bidders may associate a higher value for these items 
if they were combined with items already awarded to others hence 
the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form 
of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that 
results in sufficient revenue we have called this the bid-taker s 
exposure problem that bears similarities to the exposure 
problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit 
auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items 
however reallocating items may be regarded as disruptive to a 
solution in many real-life scenarios consider a scenario where 
procurement for a business is conducted using a ca it would be 
highly undesirable to retract contracts from a group of suppliers 
because of the failure of a third party a robust solution that is 
tolerant of such breaks is preferable robustness may be regarded as a 
preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by 
sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability we 
assume a probabilistic approach whereby the bid-taker has 
knowledge of the reliability of bidders from which the likelihood of an 
incomplete transaction may be inferred 
repair solutions are required for bids that are seen as brittle 
 i e likely to break repairs may also be required for sets of 
bids deemed brittle we propose the use of the weighted super 
 
solutions wss framework for constraint programming that 
is ideal for establishing such robust solutions as we shall see 
this framework can enforce constraints on solutions so that 
possible breakages are reparable 
this paper is organized as follows section presents the 
winner determination problem wdp for combinatorial auctions 
outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how 
simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue 
losses for risk-averse bid-takers this motivates the use of robust 
solutions and section introduces a constraint programming cp 
framework weighted super solutions that finds such 
solutions we then propose an auction model in section that enhances 
reparability by introducing mandatory mutual bid bonds that may 
be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract 
section presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach 
presented in this paper in the context of a number of well-known 
combinatorial auction distributions with very encouraging results 
section discusses possible extensions and questions raised by our 
research that deserve future work finally in section a number 
of concluding remarks are made 
 combinatorial auctions 
before presenting the technical details of our solution to the 
bid-taker s exposure problem we shall present a brief survey 
of combinatorial auctions and existing techniques for handling bid 
withdrawal 
combinatorial auctions involve a single bid-taker allocating 
multiple distinguishable items amongst a group of bidders the 
bidtaker has a set of m items for sale m m and 
bidders submit a set of bids b b b bn a bid is a tuple 
bj sj pj where sj ⊆ m is a subset of the items for sale and 
pj ≥ is a price the wdp for a ca is to label all bids as either 
winning or losing so as to maximize the revenue from winning bids 
without allocating any item to more than one bid the following is 
the integer programming formulation for the wdp 
max 
n 
j 
pjxj s t 
j i∈sj 
xj ≤ ∀i ∈ m xj ∈ 
this problem is np-complete and inapproximable 
and is otherwise known as the set packing problem the above 
problem formulation assumes the notion of free disposal this 
means that the optimal solution need not necessarily sell all of the 
items if the auction rules stipulate that all items must be sold the 
problem becomes a set partition problem the wdp has been 
extensively studied in recent years the fastest search algorithms 
that find optimal solutions e g cabob can in practice 
solve very large problems involving thousands of bids very quickly 
 the problem of bid withdrawal 
we assume an auction protocol with a three stage process 
involving the submission of bids winner determination and finally 
a transaction phase we are interested in bid withdrawals that 
occur between the announcement of winning bids and the end of the 
transaction phase all bids are valid until the transaction is 
complete so we anticipate an expedient transaction process 
 
 
in some instances the transaction period may be so lengthy that 
consideration of non-winning bids as still being valid may not be 
fair breaks that occur during a lengthy transaction phase are more 
difficult to remedy and may require a subsequent auction for 
example if the item is a service contract for a given period of time and 
the break occurs after partial fulfilment of this contract the other 
an example of a winning bid withdrawal occurred in an fcc 
spectrum auction withdrawals or breaks may occur for 
various reasons bid withdrawal may be instigated by the bid-taker 
when quality of service agreements are broken or payment 
deadlines are not met we refer to bid withdrawal by the bid-taker as 
item withdrawal in this paper to distinguish between the actions 
of a bidder and the bid-taker harstad and rothkopf outlined 
several possibilities for breaks in single item auctions that include 
 an erroneous initial valuation bid 
 unexpected events outside the winning bidder s control 
 a desire to have the second-best bid honored 
 information obtained or events that occurred after the auction 
but before the transaction that reduces the value of an item 
 the revelation of competing bidders valuations infers reduced 
profitability a problem known as the winner s curse 
kastner et al examined how to handle perturbations given 
a solution whilst minimizing necessary changes to that solution 
these perturbations may include bid withdrawals change of 
valuation items of a bid or the submission of a new bid they looked at 
the problem of finding incremental solutions to restructure a 
supply chain whose formation is determined using combinatorial 
auctions following a perturbation in the optimal solution they 
proceed to impose involuntary item withdrawals from winning 
bidders they formulated an incremental integer linear program ilp 
that sought to maximize the valuation of the repair solution whilst 
preserving the previous solution as much as possible 
 being proactive against bid withdrawal 
when a bid is withdrawn there may be constraints on how the 
solution can be repaired if the bid-taker was freely able to revoke 
the awarding of items to other bidders then the solution could be 
repaired easily by reassigning all the items to the optimal solution 
without the withdrawn bid alternatively the bidder who reneged 
upon a bid may have all his other bids disqualified and the items 
could be reassigned based on the optimum solution without that 
bidder present however the bid-taker is often unable to freely 
reassign the items already awarded to other bidders when items 
cannot be withdrawn from winning bidders following the failure of 
another bidder to honor his bid repair solutions are restricted to the 
set of bids whose items only include those in the bid s that were 
reneged upon we are free to award items to any of the previously 
unsuccessful bids when finding a repair solution 
when faced with uncertainty over the reliability of bidders a 
possible approach is to maximize expected revenue this approach 
does not make allowances for risk-averse bid-takers who may view 
a small possibility of very low revenue as unacceptable 
consider the example in table and the optimal expected 
revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn there 
are three submitted bids for items a and b the third being a 
combination bid for the pair of items at a value of the optimal 
solution has a value of with the first and second bids as 
winners when we consider the probabilities of failure in the fourth 
column the problem of which solution to choose becomes more 
difficult 
computing the expected revenue for the solution with the first 
and second bids winning the items denoted gives 
 × × × × × × × 
bidders valuations for the item may have decreased in a non-linear 
fashion 
 
table example combinatorial auction

x 
x 
x 
if a single bid is withdrawn there is probability of of a revenue 
of given the fact that we cannot withdraw an item from the 
other winning bidder the expected revenue for is 
 × × 
we can therefore surmise that the second solution is preferable to 
the first based on expected revenue 
determining the maximum expected revenue in the presence of 
such uncertainty becomes computationally infeasible however as 
the number of brittle bids grows a wdp needs to be solved for all 
possible combinations of bids that may fail the possible loss in 
revenue for breaks is also not tightly bounded using this approach 
therefore a large loss may be possible for a small number of breaks 
consider the previous example where the bid amount for x 
becomes the expected revenue of becomes 
greater than that of there are some bid-takers 
who may prefer the latter solution because the revenue is never less 
than but the former solution returns revenue of only with 
probability a risk-averse bid-taker may not tolerate such a 
possibility preferring to sacrifice revenue for reduced risk 
if we modify our repair search so that a solution of at least a 
given revenue is guaranteed the search for a repair solution 
becomes a satisfiability test rather than an optimization problem the 
approaches described above are in contrast to that which we 
propose in the next section our approach can be seen as preventative 
in that we find an initial allocation of items to bidders which is 
robust to bid withdrawal possible losses in revenue are bounded by 
a fixed percentage of the true optimal allocation perturbations to 
the original solution are also limited so as to minimize disruption 
we regard this as the ideal approach for real-world combinatorial 
auctions 
definition robust solution for a ca a robust 
solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of 
successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or 
equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most 
β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution 
constraints on acceptable revenue e g being a minimum 
percentage of the optimum are defined in the problem model and are 
thus satisfied by all solutions the maximum cost of repair β may 
be a fixed value that may be thought of as a fund for 
compensating winning bidders whose items are withdrawn from them when 
creating a repair solution alternatively β may be a function of 
the bids that were withdrawn section will give an example of 
such a mechanism in the following section we describe an ideal 
constraint-based framework for the establishment of such robust 
solutions 
 finding robust solutions 
in constraint programming cp a constraint satisfaction 
problem csp is modeled as a set of n variables x x xn 
a set of domains d d x d xn where d xi is 
the set of finite possible values for variable xi and a set c 
 c cm of constraints each restricting the assignments of 
some subset of the variables in x constraint satisfaction involves 
finding values for each of the problem variables such that all 
constraints are satisfied its main advantages are its declarative nature 
and flexibility in tackling problems with arbitrary side constraints 
constraint optimization seeks to find a solution to a csp that 
optimizes some objective function a common technique for solving 
constraint optimization problems is to use branch-and-bound 
techniques that avoid exploring sub-trees that are known not to contain 
a better solution than the best found so far an initial bound can be 
determined by finding a solution that satisfies all constraints in c 
or by using some heuristic methods 
a classical super solution ss is a solution to a csp in which 
if a small number of variables lose their values repair solutions 
are guaranteed with only a few changes thus providing solution 
robustness it is a generalization of both fault tolerance in 
cp and supermodels in propositional satisfiability sat 
an a b -super solution is one in which if at most a variables lose 
their values a repair solution can be found by changing at most b 
other variables 
super solutions for combinatorial auctions minimize the number 
of bids whose status needs to be changed when forming a repair 
solution only a particular set of variables in the solution may 
be subject to change and these are said to be members of the 
breakset for each combination of brittle assignments in the break-set a 
repair-set is required that comprises the set of variables whose 
values must change to provide another solution the cardinality of the 
repair set is used to measure the cost of repair in reality 
changing some variable assignments in a repair solution incurs a lower 
cost than others thereby motivating the use of a different metric for 
determining the legality of repair sets 
the weighted super solution wss framework considers 
the cost of repair required rather than simply the number of 
assignments modified to form an alternative solution for cas this 
may be a measure of the compensation penalties paid to winning 
bidders to break existing agreements robust solutions are 
particularly desirable for applications where unreliability is a problem 
and potential breakages may incur severe penalties weighted 
super solutions offer a means of expressing which variables are 
easily re-assigned and those that incur a heavy cost hebrard et 
al describe how some variables may fail such as machines in a 
job-shop problem and others may not a wss generalizes this 
approach so that there is a probability of failure associated with each 
assignment and sets of variables whose assignments have 
probabilities of failure greater than or equal to a threshold value α require 
repair solutions 
a wss measures the cost of repairing or reassigning other 
variables using inertia as a metric inertia is a measure of a variable s 
aversion to change and depends on its current assignment future 
assignment and the breakage variable s 
it may be desirable to reassign items to different bidders in order 
to find a repair solution of satisfactory revenue compensation may 
have to be paid to bidders who lose items during the formation of a 
repair solution the inertia of a bid reflects the cost of changing its 
state for winning bids this may reflect the necessary compensation 
penalty for the bid-taker to break the agreement if such breaches 
are permitted whereas for previously losing bids this is a free 
operation the total amount of compensation payable to bidders may 
depend upon other factors such as the cause of the break there is 
a limit to how much these overall repair costs should be and this is 
given by the value β this value may not be known in advance and 
 
algorithm wss int level double α double β boolean 
begin 
if level number of variables then return true 
choose unassigned variable x 
foreach value v in the domain of x do 
assign x v 
if problem is consistent then 
foreach combination of brittle assignments a do 
if ¬reparable a β then return false 
if wss level then return true 
unassign x 
return false 
end 
may depend upon the break therefore β may be viewed as the 
fund used to compensate winning bidders for the unilateral 
withdrawal of their bids by the bid-taker in summary an α β -wss 
allows any set of variables whose probability of breaking is greater 
than or equal to α be repaired with changes to the original robust 
solution with a cost of at most β 
the depth-first search for a wss see pseudo-code description 
in algorithm maintains arc-consistency at each node of the 
tree as search progresses the reparability of each previous 
assignment is verified at each node by extending a partial repair 
solution to the same depth as the current partial solution this may 
be thought of as maintaining concurrent search trees for repairs 
a repair solution is provided for every possible set of break 
variables a the wss algorithm attempts to extend the current partial 
assignment by choosing a variable and assigning it a value 
backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons we cannot extend 
the assignment to satisfy the given constraints or the current 
partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose 
cost of repair is less than β should a break occur the procedure 
reparable searches for partial repair solutions using 
backtracking and attempts to extend the last repair found just as in 
 b super solutions the differences being that a repair is provided 
for a set of breakage variables rather than a single variable and the 
cost of repair is considered a summation operator is used to 
determine the overall cost of repair if a fixed bound upon the size of 
any potential break-set can be formed the wss algorithm is 
npcomplete for a more detailed description of the wss search 
algorithm the reader is referred to since a complete description of 
the algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper 
example we shall step through the example given in 
table when searching for a wss each bid is represented by a 
single variable with domain values of and the former representing 
bid-failure and the latter bid-success the probability of failure of 
the variables are when they are assigned to and 
otherwise the problem is initially solved using an ilp solver such as 
lp solve or cplex and the optimal revenue is found to be 
 a fixed percentage of this revenue can be used as a threshold 
value for a robust solution and its repairs the bid-taker wishes to 
have a robust solution so that if a single winning bid is withdrawn 
a repair solution can be formed without withdrawing items from 
any other winning bidder this example may be seen as searching 
for a -weighted super solution β is because no funds are 
available to compensate the withdrawal of items from winning 
bidders the bid-taker is willing to compromise on revenue but only 
by say of the optimal value 
bids and cannot both succeed since they both require item 
a so a constraint is added precluding the assignment in which both 
variables take the value similarly bids and cannot both win 
so another constraint is added between these two variables 
therefore in this example the set of csp variables is v x x x 
whose domains are all the constraints are x x ≤ 
x x ≤ and xi∈v aixi ≥ where ai reflects the 
relevant bid-amounts for the respective bid variables in order to find a 
robust solution of optimal revenue we seek to maximize the sum of 
these amounts max xi∈v aixi 
when all variables are set to see figure a branch this is 
not a solution because the minimum revenue of has not been 
met so we try assigning bid to branch this is a valid 
solution but this variable is brittle because there is a chance that 
this bid may be withdrawn see table therefore we need to 
determine if a repair can be formed should it break the search for a 
repair begins at the first node see figure b notice that value 
has been removed from bid because this search tree is simulating 
the withdrawal of this bid when bid is set to branch the 
maximum revenue solution in the remaining subtree has revenue of 
only therefore search is discontinued at that node of the tree 
bid and bid are both assigned to branches and and 
the total cost of both these changes is still because no 
compensation needs to be paid for bids that change from losing to winning 
with bid now losing branch this gives a repair solution of 
 hence is reparable and therefore a wss we continue 
our search in figure a however because we are seeking a robust 
solution of optimal revenue 
when bid is assigned to branch we seek a partial repair 
for this variable breaking branch is not considered since it offers 
insufficient revenue the repair search sets bid to in a separate 
search tree not shown and control is returned to the search for 
a wss bid is set to branch but this solution would not 
produce sufficient revenue so bid is then set to branch we 
then attempt to extend the repair for bid not shown this fails 
because the repair for bid cannot assign bid to because the 
cost of repairing such an assignment would be ∞ given that the 
auction rules do not permit the withdrawal of items from winning 
bids a repair for bid breaking is therefore not possible because 
items have already been awarded to bid a repair solution with 
bid assigned to does not produce sufficient revenue when bid 
is assigned to the inability to withdraw items from winning bids 
implies that is an irreparable solution when the minimum 
tolerable revenue is greater than the italicized comments and 
dashed line in figure a illustrate the search path for a wss if 
both of these bids were deemed reparable 
section introduces an alternative auction model that will allow 
the bid-taker to receive compensation for breakages and in turn use 
this payment to compensate other bidders for withdrawal of items 
from winning bids this will enable the reallocation of items and 
permit the establishment of as a second wss for this 
example 
 mutual bid bonds a 
backtracking mechanism 
some auction solutions are inherently brittle and it may be 
impossible to find a robust solution if we can alter the rules of an 
auction so that the bid-taker can retract items from winning 
bidders then the reparability of solutions to such auctions may be 
improved in this section we propose an auction model that permits 
bid and item withdrawal by the bidders and bid-taker respectively 
we propose a model that incorporates mutual bid bonds to enable 
solution reparability for the bid-taker a form of insurance against

 b search for a repair for bid breakage 
figure search tree for a wss without item withdrawal 
the winner s curse for the bidder whilst also compensating bidders 
in the case of item withdrawal from winning bids we propose that 
such winner s curse bid-taker s exposure insurance comprise 
a fixed percentage κ of the bid amount for all bids such mutual 
bid bonds are mandatory for each bid in our model 
 the conditions 
attached to the bid bonds are that the bid-taker be allowed to annul 
winning bids item withdrawal when repairing breaks elsewhere 
in the solution in the interests of fairness compensation is paid 
to bidders from whom items are withdrawn and is equivalent to the 
penalty that would have been imposed on the bidder should he have 
withdrawn the bid 
combinatorial auctions impose a heavy computational burden 
on the bidder so it is important that the hedging of risk should be 
a simple and transparent operation for the bidder so as not to 
further increase this burden unnecessarily we also contend that it 
is imperative that the bidder knows the potential penalty for 
withdrawal in advance of bid submission this information is essential 
for bidders when determining how aggressive they should be in 
their bidding strategy bid bonds are commonplace in procurement 
for construction projects usually they are mandatory for all bids 
are a fixed percentage κ of the bid amount and are unidirectional 
in that item withdrawal by the bid-taker is not permitted mutual 
bid bonds may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract 
in which both parties may break the contract for the same fixed 
penalty such contracts permit unilateral decommitment for 
prespecified penalties sandholm et al showed that this can increase 
the expected payoffs of all parties and enables deals that would be 
impossible under full commitment 
in practice a bid bond typically ranges between and of the 
 
making the insurance optional may be beneficial in some 
instances if a bidder does not agree to the insurance it may be 
inferred that he may have accurately determined the valuation for the 
items and therefore less likely to fall victim to the winner s curse 
the probability of such a bid being withdrawn may be less so a 
repair solution may be deemed unnecessary for this bid on the other 
hand it decreases the reparability of solutions 
bid amount if the decommitment penalties are the same 
for both parties in all bids κ does not influence the reparability of 
a given set of bids it merely influences the levels of penalties and 
compensation transacted by agents low values of κ incur low bid 
withdrawal penalties and simulate a dictatorial bid-taker who does 
not adequately compensate bidders for item withdrawal andersson 
and sandholm found that myopic agents reach a higher social 
welfare quicker if they act selfishly rather than cooperatively when 
penalties in leveled commitment contracts are low increased levels 
of bid withdrawal are likely when the penalties are low also 
high values of κ tend towards full-commitment and reduce the 
advantages of such winner s curse bid-taker s exposure 
insurance the penalties paid are used to fund a reassignment of 
items to form a repair solution of sufficient revenue by 
compensating previously successful bidders for withdrawal of the items from 
them 
example consider the example given in table once more 
where the bids also comprise a mutual bid bond of of the bid 
amount if a bid is withdrawn the bidder forfeits this amount and 
the bid-taker can then compensate winning bidders whose items are 
withdrawn when trying to form a repair solution later the search 
for repair solutions for breaks to bid and bid appear in figures 
 a and b respectively 
 
when bid breaks there is a compensation penalty paid to the 
bid-taker equal to that can be used to fund a reassignment of the 
items we therefore set β to and this becomes the maximum 
expenditure allowed to withdraw items from winning bidders β 
may also be viewed as the size of the fund available to facilitate 
backtracking by the bid-taker when we extend the partial repair 
for bid so that bid loses an item branch the overall cost of 
repair increases to due to this item withdrawal by the bid-taker 
 
the actual implementation of wss search checks previous 
solutions to see if they can repair breaks before searching for a new 
repair solution is a solution that has already been found 
so the search for a repair in this example is not strictly necessary 
but is described for pedagogical reasons

robust solution of revenue as opposed to as was previously 
the case 
 experiments 
we have used the combinatorial auction test suite cats 
to generate sample auction data we generated instances of 
problems in which there are items for sale and - bids 
that may be dominated in some instances 
 such dominated bids 
can participate in repair solutions although they do not feature in 
optimal solutions cats uses economically motivated bidding 
patterns to generate auction data in various scenarios to motivate the 
research presented in this paper we use sensitivity analysis to 
examine the brittleness of optimal solutions and hence determine the 
types of auctions most likely to benefit from a robust solution we 
then establish robust solutions for cas using the wss framework 
 sensitivity analysis for the wdp 
we have performed sensitivity analysis of the following four 
distributions airport take-off landing slots matching electronic 
components arbitrary property spectrum-rights regions 
and transportation paths these distributions were chosen 
because they describe a broad array of bidding patterns in different 
application domains 
the method used is as follows we first of all determined the 
optimal solution using lp solve a mixed integer linear program 
solver we then simulated a single bid withdrawal and re-solved 
the problem with the other winning bids remaining fixed i e there 
were no involuntary dropouts the optimal repair solution was 
then determined this process is repeated for all winning bids in 
the overall optimal solution thus assuming that all bids are brittle 
figure shows the average revenue of such repair solutions as a 
percentage of the optimum also shown is the average worst-case 
scenario over auctions we also implemented an auction rule 
that disallows bids from the reneging bidder participate in a repair 
 
figure a illustrates how the paths distribution is inherently 
the most robust distribution since when any winning bid is 
withdrawn the solution can be repaired to achieve over of the 
 
the cats flags included int prices with the bid alpha parameter 
set to 
 
we assumed that all bids in a given xor bid with the same 
dummy item were from the same bidder 
optimal revenue on average for auctions with more than bids 
there are some cases however when such withdrawals result in 
solutions whose revenue is significantly lower than optimum even 
in auctions with as many as bids there are occasions when a 
single bid withdrawal can result in a drop in revenue of over 
although the average worst-case drop in revenue is only 
figure b shows how the matching distribution is more brittle on 
average than paths and also has an inferior worst-case revenue on 
average this trend continues as the regions-npv figure c 
and arbitrary-npv figure d distributions are more 
brittle still these distributions are clearly sensitive to bid withdrawal 
when no other winning bids in the solution may be involuntarily 
withdrawn by the bid-taker 
 robust solutions using wss 
in this section we focus upon both the arbitrary-npv and 
regions-npv distributions because the sensitivity analysis 
indicated that these types of auctions produce optimal solutions that 
tend to be most brittle and therefore stand to benefit most from 
solution robustness we ignore the auctions with bids because 
the sensitivity analysis has indicated that these auctions are 
inherently robust with a very low average drop in revenue following a bid 
withdrawal they would also be very computationally expensive 
given the extra complexity of finding robust solutions 
a pure cp approach needs to be augmented with global 
constraints that incorporate operations research techniques to increase 
pruning sufficiently so that thousands of bids may be examined 
global constraints exploit special-purpose filtering algorithms to 
improve performance there are a number of ways to speed 
up the search for a weighted super solution in a ca although this 
is not the main focus of our current work polynomial matching 
algorithms may be used in auctions whose bid length is short such 
as those for airport landing take-off slots for example the integer 
programming formulation of the wdp stipulates that a bid either 
loses or wins if we relax this constraint so that bids can partially 
win this corresponds to the linear relaxation of the problem and is 
solvable in polynomial time at each node of the search tree we 
can quickly solve the linear relaxation of the remaining problem in 
the subtree below the current node to establish an upper bound on 
remaining revenue if this upper bound plus revenue in the parent 
tree is less than the current lower bound on revenue search at that 
node can cease the continuous lp relaxation thus provides a 
vital speed-up in the search for weighted super solutions which we 
have exploited in our implementation the lp formulation is as

additional techniques that are outlined in can aid the 
scalability of a cp approach but our main aim in these experiments is 
to examine the robustness of various auction distributions and 
consider the tradeoff between robustness and revenue the wss solver 
we have developed is an extension of the super solution solver 
presented in this solver is in turn based upon the efc 
constraint solver 
combinatorial auctions are easily modeled as a constraint 
optimization problems we have chosen the branch-on-bids 
formulation because in tests it worked faster than a branch-on-items 
formulation for the arbitrary-npv and regions-npv 
distributions all variables are binary and our search mechanism uses a 
reverse lexicographic value ordering heuristic this complements our 
dynamic variable ordering heuristic that selects the most promising 
unassigned variable as the next one in the search tree we use the 
product of the solution of the lp relaxation and the degree of a 
variable to determine the likelihood of its participation in a robust 
solution high values in the lp solution are a strong indication of 
variables most likely to form a high revenue solution whilst the a 
variable s degree reflects the number of other bids that overlap in 
terms of desired items bids for large numbers of items tend to be 
more robust which is why we weight our robust solution search in 
this manner we found this heuristic to be slightly more effective 
than the lp solution alone as the number of bids in the auction 
increases however there is an increase in the inherent robustness 
of solutions so the degree of a variable loses significance as the 
auction size increases 
 results 
our experiments simulate three different constraints on repair 
solutions the first is that no winning bids are withdrawn by the 
bid-taker and a repair solution must return a revenue of at least 
of the optimal overall solution secondly we relaxed the revenue 
constraint to of optimum thirdly we allowed backtracking 
by the bid-taker on winning bids using mutual bid bonds but 
maintaining the revenue constraint at of optimum 
prior to finding a robust solution we solved the wdp optimally 
using lp solve we then set the minimum tolerable revenue 
for a solution to be then of the revenue of this 
optimal solution we assumed that all bids were brittle thus a repair 
solution is required for every bid in the solution initially we 
assume that no backtracking was permitted on assignments of items 
to other winning bids given a bid withdrawal elsewhere in the 
solution table shows the percentage of optimal solutions that are 
robust for minimum revenue constraints for repair solutions of 
and of optimal revenue relaxing the revenue constraint on 
repair solutions to of the optimum revenue greatly increases the 
number of optimal solutions that are robust we also conducted 
experiments on the same auctions in which backtracking by the 
bid-taker is permitted using mutual bid bonds this significantly 
improves the reparability of optimal solutions whilst still 
maintaining repair solutions of of optimum an interesting feature 
of the arbitrary-npv distribution is that optimal solutions can 
become more brittle as the number of bids increases the reason 
for this is that optimal solutions for larger auctions have more 
winning bids some of the optimal solutions for the smallest auctions 
with bids have only one winning bidder if this bid is 
withdrawn it is usually easy to find a new repair solution within of 
the previous optimal revenue also repair solutions for bids that 
contain a small number of items may be made difficult by the fact 
that a reduced number of bids cover only a subset of those items a 
mitigating factor is that such bids form a smaller percentage of the 
revenue of the optimal solution on average 
we also implemented a rule stipulating that any losing bids from

a withdrawing bidder cannot participate in a repair solution this 
acts as a disincentive for strategic withdrawal and was also used 
previously in the sensitivity analysis in some auctions a robust 
solution may not exist table shows the percentage of auctions that 
support robust solutions for the arbitrary-npv and regions 
-npv distributions it is clear that finding robust solutions for the 
former distribution is particularly difficult for auctions with and 
 bids when revenue constraints are of optimum this 
difficulty was previously alluded to by the low percentage of optimal 
solutions that were robust for these auctions relaxing the revenue 
constraint helps increase the percentage of auctions in which robust 
solutions are achievable to and respectively this 
improves the reparability of all solutions thereby increasing the 
average revenue of the optimal robust solution it is somewhat 
counterintuitive to expect a reduction in reparability of auction solutions as 
the number of bids increases because there tends to be an increased 
number of solutions above a revenue threshold in larger auctions 
the mbb auction model performs very well however and ensures 
that robust solutions are achievable for such inherently brittle 
auctions without sacrificing over of optimal revenue to achieve 
repair solutions 
figure shows the average revenue of the optimal robust 
solution as a percentage of the overall optimum repair solutions found 
for a wss provide a lower bound on possible revenue following a 
bid withdrawal note that in some instances it is possible for a 
repair solution to have higher revenue than the original solution 
when backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker is disallowed 
this can only happen when the repair solution includes two or more 
bids that were not in the original otherwise the repair bids would 
participate in the optimal robust solution in place of the bid that 
was withdrawn a wss guarantees minimum levels of revenue for 
repair solutions but this is not to say that repair solutions cannot be 
improved upon it is possible to use an incremental algorithm to

determine an optimal repair solution following a break whilst safe 
in the knowledge that in advance of any possible bid withdrawal 
we can establish a lower bound on the revenue of a repair kastner 
et al have provided such an incremental ilp formulation 
mutual bid bonds facilitate backtracking by the bid-taker on 
already assigned items this improves the reparability of all 
possible solutions thus increasing the revenue of the optimal robust 
solution on average figure shows the increase in revenue of 
robust solutions in such instances the revenues of repair 
solutions are bounded by at least of the optimum in our 
experiments thereby allowing a direct comparison with robust solutions 
already found using the same revenue constraint but not providing 
for backtracking it is immediately obvious that such a mechanism 
can significantly increase revenue whilst still maintaining solution 
robustness 
table shows the number of winning bids participating in 
optimal and optimal robust solutions given the three different 
constraints on repairing solutions listed at the beginning of this 
section as the number of bids increases more of the optimal overall 
solutions are robust this leads to a convergence in the number of 
winning bids the numbers in brackets are derived from the 
sensitivity analysis of optimal solutions that reveals the fact that almost 
all optimal solutions for auctions of bids are robust we can 
therefore infer that the average number of winning bids in 
revenuemaximizing robust solutions converges towards that of the optimal 
overall solutions 
a notable side-effect of robust solutions is that fewer bids 
participate in the solutions it can be clearly seen from table that when 
revenue constraints on repair solutions are tight there are fewer 
winning bids in the optimal robust solution on average this is 
particularly pronounced for smaller auctions in both distributions 
this can win benefits for the bid-taker such as reduced overheads in 
dealing with fewer suppliers although mbbs aid solution

bility the number of bids in the solutions increases on average 
this is to be expected because a greater fraction of these solutions 
are in fact optimal as we saw in table 
 discussion and future work 
bidding strategies can become complex in 
non-incentive-compatible mechanisms where winner determination is no longer 
necessarily optimal the perceived reparability of a bid may influence the 
bid amount with reparable bids reaching a lower equilibrium point 
and perceived irreparable bids being more aggressive 
penalty payments for bid withdrawal also create an incentive for 
more aggressive bidding by providing a form of insurance against 
the winner s curse if a winning bidder s revised valuation for 
a set of items drops by more than the penalty for withdrawal of 
the bid then it is in his best interests to forfeit the item s and pay 
the penalty should the auction rules state that the bid-taker will 
refuse to sell the items to any of the remaining bidders in the event 
of a withdrawal then insurance against potential losses will 
stimulate more aggressive bidding however in our case we are seeking 
to repair the solution with the given bids a side-effect of such a 
policy is to offset the increased aggressiveness by incentivizing 
reduced valuations in expectation that another bidder s successful bid 
is withdrawn harstad and rothkopf examined the conditions 
required to ensure an equilibrium position in which bidding was at 
least as aggressive as if no bid withdrawal was permitted given this 
countervailing incentive to under-estimate a valuation three 
major results arose from their study of bid withdrawal in a single item 
auction 
 equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal for 
sufficiently small probabilities of an award to the second 
highest bidder in the event of a bid withdrawal 
 equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if 
the number of bidders is large enough 
 for many distributions of costs and estimates equilibrium 
bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the variability 
of the estimating distribution is sufficiently large 
it is important that mutual bid bonds do not result in depressed 
bidding in equilibrium an analysis of the resultant behavior of 
bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item 
and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a 
repair solution after a break elsewhere harstad and rothkopf have 
analyzed bidder aggressiveness using a strictly game-theoretic 
model in which the only reason for bid withdrawal is the winner s 
curse they assumed all bidders were risk-neutral but surmised 
that it is entirely possible for the bid-taker to collect a risk premium 
from risk-averse bidders with the offer of such insurance 
combinatorial auctions with mutual bid bonds add an extra incentive to 
bid aggressively because of the possibility of being compensated 
for having a winning bid withdrawn by a bid-taker this is militated 
against by the increased probability of not having items withdrawn 
in a repair solution we leave an in-depth analysis of the sufficient 
conditions for more aggressive bidding for future work 
whilst the wss framework provides ample flexibility and 
expressiveness scalability becomes a problem for larger auctions 
although solutions to larger auctions tend to be naturally more 
robust some bid-takers in such auctions may require robustness a 
possible extension of our work in this paper may be to examine the 
feasibility of reformulating integer linear programs so that the 
solutions are robust hebrard et al examined reformulation of 
csps for finding super solutions alternatively it may be 
possible to use a top-down approach by looking at the k-best solutions 
sequentially in terms of revenue and performing sensitivity 
analysis upon each solution until a robust one is found in procurement 
settings the principle of free disposal is often discounted and all 
items must be sold this reduces the number of potential solutions 
and thereby reduces the reparability of each solution the impact 
of such a constraint on revenue of robust solutions is also left for 
future work 
there is another interesting direction this work may take namely 
robust mechanism design porter et al introduced the notion of 
fault tolerant mechanism design in which agents have private 
information regarding costs for task completion but also their 
probabilities of failure when the bid-taker has combinatorial 
valuations for task completions it may be desirable to assign the same 
task to multiple agents to ensure solution robustness it is desirable 
to minimize such potentially redundant task assignments but not to 
the detriment of completed task valuations this problem could be 
modeled using the wss framework in a similar manner to that of 
combinatorial auctions 
in the case where no robust solutions are found it is possible 
to optimize robustness instead of revenue by finding a solution 
of at least a given revenue that minimizes the probability of an 
irreparable break in this manner the least brittle solution of adequate 
revenue may be chosen 
 conclusion 
fairness is often cited as a reason for choosing the optimal 
solution in terms of revenue only robust solutions militate against 
bids deemed brittle therefore bidders must earn a reputation for 
being reliable to relax the reparability constraint attached to their 
bids this may be seen as being fair to long-standing business 
partners whose reliability is unquestioned internet-based auctions 
are often seen as unwelcome price-gouging exercises by suppliers 
in many sectors traditional business partnerships are 
being severed by increased competition amongst suppliers quality 
of service can suffer because of the increased focus on short-term 
profitability to the detriment of the bid-taker in the long-term 
robust solutions can provide a means of selectively discriminating 
against distrusted bidders in a measured manner as 
combinatorial auction deployment moves from large value auctions with a 
small pool of trusted bidders e g spectrum-rights sales towards 
lower value auctions with potentially unknown bidders e g 
supply chain management solution robustness becomes more 
relevant as well as being used to ensure that the bid-taker is not 
left vulnerable to bid withdrawal it may also be used to cement 
relationships with preferred possibly incumbent suppliers 
 
we have shown that it is possible to attain robust solutions for 
cas with only a small loss in revenue we have also illustrated 
how such solutions tend to have fewer winning bids than overall 
optimal solutions thereby reducing any overheads associated with 
dealing with more bidders we have also demonstrated that 
introducing mutual bid bonds a form of leveled commitment contract 
can significantly increase the revenue of optimal robust solutions 
by improving reparability we contend that robust solutions 
using such a mechanism can allow a bid-taker to offer the possibility 
of bid withdrawal to bidders whilst remaining confident about 
postrepair revenue and also facilitating increased bidder aggressiveness
