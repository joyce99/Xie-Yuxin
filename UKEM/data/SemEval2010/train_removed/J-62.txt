 introduction 
social choice theory centers around the general problem of 
selecting a single outcome out of a set a of alternative 
outcomes based on the individual preferences of a set p of 
players a method for aggregating player preferences to select 
one outcome is called a social choice function in this paper 
we assume that the range a is finite and that each player s 
preference is expressed by a valuation function which 
assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing 
the benefit the player derives from that outcome the 
ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a 
valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by 
outcomes 
a major difficulty connected with social choice functions 
is that players can not be required to tell the truth about 
their preferences since each player seeks to maximize his 
own benefit he may find it in his interest to misrepresent 
his valuation function an important approach for dealing 
with this problem is to augment a given social choice 
function with a payment function which assigns to each player 
a positive or negative payment as a function of all of the 
individual preferences by carefully choosing the payment 
function one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth 
a social choice function augmented with a payment function 
is called a mechanism 
and the mechanism is said to 
implement the social choice function a mechanism is truthful 
 or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy if 
each player s best strategy knowing the preferences of the 
others is always to declare his own true preferences a 
social choice function is truthfully implementable or truthful 
if it has a truthful implementation the property of 
truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy 
incentive compatibility this framework leads naturally to 
the question which social choice functions are truthful 
this question is of the following general type given a 
class of functions here social choice functions and a 
property that holds for some of them here truthfulness 
characterize the property the definition of the property itself 
provides a characterization so what more is needed here 
are some useful notions of characterization 
 recognition algorithm give an algorithm which given 
an appropriate representation of a function in the class 
determines whether the function has the property 
 parametric representation give an explicit parametrized 
family of functions and show that each function in the 
 
the usual definition of mechanism is more general than this 
 see chapter c or the mechanisms we consider 
here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms 
 
family has the property and that every function with 
the property is in the family 
a third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties 
of functions a function g is a subfunction of function f or 
f contains g if g is obtained by restricting the domain of 
f a property p of functions is hereditary if it is preserved 
under taking subfunctions truthfulness is easily seen to be 
hereditary 
 sets of obstructions for a hereditary property p a 
function g that does not have the property is an 
obstruction to the property in the sense that any function 
containing g doesn t have the property an obstruction 
is minimal if every proper subfunction has the 
property a set of obstructions is complete if every function 
that does not have the property contains one of them 
as a subfunction the set of all functions that don t 
satisfy p is a complete but trivial and uninteresting 
set of obstructions one seeks a set of small ideally 
minimal obstructions 
we are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms 
for the property of truthfulness but there are significant 
results concerning parametric representations and obstruction 
characterizations of truthfulness it turns out that the 
domain of the function i e the set of allowed valuation 
matrices is crucial for functions with unrestricted domain i e 
whose domain is the set of all real matrices there are very 
good characterizations of truthfulness for general domains 
however the picture is far from complete typically the 
domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of 
constraints for example an order constraint requires that 
one specified entry in some row be larger than another in 
the same row a range constraint places an upper or lower 
bound on an entry and a zero constraint forces an entry to 
be these are all examples of linear inequality constraints 
on the matrix entries 
building on work of roberts lavi mu alem and 
nisan defined a condition called weak monotonicity 
 wmon independently in the context of multi-unit 
auctions bikhchandani chatterji and sen identified the 
same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal 
utilities ndmu the definition of w-mon can be formulated 
in terms of obstructions for some specified simple set f of 
functions each having domains of size a function satisfies 
w-mon if it contains no function from f the functions 
in f are not truthful and therefore w-mon is a 
necessary condition for truthfulness lavi mu alem and nisan 
 showed that w-mon is also sufficient for truthfulness 
for social choice functions whose domain is order-based i e 
defined by order constraints and zero constraints and gui 
muller and vohra extended this to other domains the 
domain constraints considered in both papers are special 
cases of linear inequality constraints and it is natural to 
ask whether w-mon is sufficient for any domain defined by 
such constraints lavi mu alem and nisan conjectured 
that w-mon suffices for convex domains the main result 
of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture 
theorem for any social choice function having 
convex domain and finite range weak monotonicity is necessary 
and sufficient for truthfulness 
using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms 
of obstructions each having domain size this provides a 
complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within 
the class of social choice functions with convex domains 
the two hypotheses on the social choice function that 
the domain is convex and that the range is finite can not 
be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 
 related work 
there is a simple and natural parametrized set of 
truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers roberts 
 showed that for functions with unrestricted domain 
every truthful function is an affine maximizer thus providing 
a parametrized representation for truthful functions with 
unrestricted domain there are many known examples of 
truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine 
maximizers see and each of these 
examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that 
there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all 
social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying 
these restrictions are affine maximizers lavi mu alem and 
nisan obtained a result in this direction by showing that 
for order-based domains under certain technical 
assumptions every truthful social choice function is almost an 
affine maximizer 
there are a number of results about truthfulness that 
can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations 
although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed 
for a player i a set of valuation matrices is said to be 
i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for 
row i call a social choice function i-local if its domain is 
ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i the following 
easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature 
proposition the social choice function f is truthful 
if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful 
this implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions 
comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness 
this set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful 
functions but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions 
rochet rozenshtrom and gui muller and vohra 
 identified a necessary and sufficient condition for 
truthfulness see lemma below called the nonnegative cycle 
property this condition can be viewed as providing a 
minimal complete set of non-truthful functions as is required 
by proposition each function in the set is local 
furthermore it is one-to-one in particular its domain has size at 
most the number of possible outcomes a 
as this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal 
non-truthful functions this provides the optimal obstruction 
characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of 
all social choice functions but by restricting attention to 
interesting subclasses of social choice functions one may hope 
to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within 
that class 
the condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can 
be defined by a set of obstructions each of which is a local 
function of domain size exactly thus the results of lavi 
mu alem and nisan and of gui muller and vohra 
give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within 
certain subclasses of social choice functions theorem 
extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions 
 
 weak monotonicity and the nonnegative 
cycle property 
by proposition a function is truthful if and only if each 
of its local subfunctions is truthful therefore to get a set 
of obstructions for truthfulness it suffices to obtain such a 
set for local functions 
the domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that 
are fixed on all rows but row i fix such a function f and 
let d ⊆ ra 
be the set of allowed choices for row i since 
f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from d we 
can view f as a function from d to a therefore f is a 
social choice function having one player we refer to such a 
function as a single player function 
associated to any single player function f with domain d 
we define an edge-weighted directed graph hf whose vertex 
set is the image of f for convenience we assume that f 
is surjective and so this image is a for each a b ∈ a 
x ∈ f− 
 a there is an edge ex a b from a to b with weight 
x a − x b the weight of a set of edges is just the sum of 
the weights of the edges we say that f satisfies 
 the nonnegative cycle property if every directed cycle 
has nonnegative weight 
 the nonnegative two-cycle property if every directed 
cycle between two vertices has nonnegative weight 
we say a local function g satisfies nonnegative cycle 
property nonnegative two-cycle property if its associated single 
player function f does 
the graph hf has a possibly infinite number of edges 
between any two vertices we define gf to be the 
edgeweighted directed graph with exactly one edge from a to b 
whose weight δab is the infimum possibly −∞ of all of the 
edge weights ex a b for x ∈ f− 
 a it is easy to see that hf 
has the nonnegative cycle property nonnegative two-cycle 
property if and only if gf does gf is called the outcome 
graph of f 
the weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can 
be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the 
condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative 
two-cycle property the following result was obtained by 
rochet in a slightly different form and rediscovered by 
rozenshtrom and gui muller and vohra 
lemma a local social choice function is truthful if and 
only if it has the nonnegative cycle property thus a social 
choice function is truthful if and only if every local 
subfunction satisfies the nonnegative cycle property 
in light of this theorem follows from 
theorem for any surjective single player function f 
d −→ a where d is a convex subset of ra 
and a is finite 
the nonnegative two-cycle property implies the nonnegative 
cycle property 
this is the result we will prove 
 overview of the proof of theorem 
let d ⊆ ra 
be convex and let f d −→ a be a single 
player function such that gf has no negative two-cycles we 
want to conclude that gf has no negative cycles for two 
vertices a b let δ 
ab denote the minimum weight of any path 
from a to b clearly δ 
ab ≤ δab our proof shows that the 
δ 
-weight of every cycle is exactly from which theorem 
follows 
there seems to be no direct way to compute δ 
and so we 
proceed indirectly based on geometric considerations we 
identify a subset of paths in gf called admissible paths and 
a subset of admissible paths called straight paths we prove 
that for any two outcomes a b there is a straight path from 
a to b lemma and corollary and all straight paths 
from a to b have the same weight which we denote ρab 
 theorem we show that ρab ≤ δab lemma and that 
the ρ-weight of every cycle is the key step to this proof 
is showing that the ρ-weight of every directed triangle is 
 lemma 
it turns out that ρ is equal to δ 
 corollary although 
this equality is not needed in the proof of theorem 
to expand on the above summary we give the definitions 
of an admissible path and a straight path these are 
somewhat technical and rely on the geometry of f we first 
observe that without loss of generality we can assume that 
d is topologically closed section in section for each 
a ∈ a we enlarge the set f− 
 a to a closed convex set 
da ⊆ d in such a way that for a b ∈ a with a b da and 
db have disjoint interiors we define an admissible path to 
be a sequence of outcomes a ak such that each of the 
sets ij daj ∩ daj is nonempty section an 
admissible path is straight if there is a straight line that meets one 
point from each of the sets i ik− in order section 
finally we mention how the hypotheses of convex domain 
and finite range are used in the proof both hypotheses are 
needed to show the existence of a straight path from a 
to b for all a b lemma that the ρ-weight of a directed 
triangle is lemma the convex domain hypothesis is 
also needed for the convexity of the sets da section the 
finite range hypothesis is also needed to reduce theorem to 
the case that d is closed section and to prove that every 
straight path from a to b has the same δ-weight theorem 
 
 reduction to closed domain 
we first reduce the theorem to the case that d is closed 
write dc 
for the closure of d since a is finite dc 
 
∪a∈a f− 
 a c 
 thus for each v ∈ dc 
− d there is an 
a a v ∈ a such that v ∈ f− 
 a c 
 extend f to the 
function g on dc 
by defining g v a v for v ∈ dc 
− 
d and g v f v for v ∈ d it is easy to check that 
δab g δab f for all a b ∈ a and therefore it suffices to 
show that the nonnegative two-cycle property for g implies 
the nonnegative cycle property for g 
henceforth we assume d is convex and closed 
 a dissection of the domain 
in this section we construct a family of closed convex sets 
 da a ∈ a with disjoint interiors whose union is d and 
satisfying f− 
 a ⊆ da for each a ∈ a 
let ra v ∀b ∈ a v a − v b ≥ δab ra is a closed 
polyhedron containing f− 
 a the next proposition 
implies that any two of these polyhedra intersect only on their 
boundary 
proposition let a b ∈ a if v ∈ ra ∩rb then v a −

figure a -dimensional domain with outcomes 
proof v ∈ ra implies v a − v b ≥ δab and v ∈ rb 
implies v b −v a ≥ δba which by the nonnegative two-cycle 
property implies v a − v b ≤ δab thus v a − v b δab 
and by symmetry v b − v a δba 
finally we restrict the collection of sets ra a ∈ a 
to the domain d by defining da ra ∩ d for each a ∈ 
a clearly da is closed and convex and contains f− 
 a 
therefore

 paths and d-sequences 
a path of size k is a sequence −→a a ak with each 
ai ∈ a possibly with repetition we call −→a an a 
ak path for a path −→a we write −→a for the size of −→a −→a is 
simple if the ai s are distinct 
for b c ∈ a we write pbc for the set of b c -paths and

with each ui ∈ d possibly with repetition we call −→u a 
 u uk -sequence for a d-sequence −→u we write ord u for 
the order of −→u for v w ∈ d we write svw 
for the set of 
 v w -sequences 
a compatible pair is a pair −→a −→u where −→a is a path 
and −→u is a d-sequence satisfying ord −→u −→a and for 
each i ∈ k both ui− and ui belong to dai 
we write c −→a for the set of d-sequences −→u that are 
compatible with −→a we say that −→a is admissible if c −→a

to illustrate these definitions figure gives the 
dissection of a domain a -dimensional plane into five regions

with both path a b c e and path a b d e d-sequence 
 v w u y z is compatible with a unique path a b d e 
d-sequence x w p y z is compatible with a unique path

admissible paths however path a c d or path b e is not 
admissible

proposition δ −→a ∆−→a −→u and δ −→a ∆−→a −→u it

 linear d-sequences and straight 
paths 
for v w ∈ d we write vw for the closed line segment 
joining v and w 
a d-sequence −→u of order k is linear provided that there 
is a sequence of real numbers λ ≤ λ ≤ ≤ λk 
such that ui − λi u λiuk in particular each ui 
belongs to u uk for v w ∈ d we write lvw 
for the set of 
linear v w -sequences 
for b c ∈ a and v w ∈ d we write lcvw 
bc for the set of 
compatible pairs −→a −→u such that −→a ∈ pbc and −→u ∈ lvw 
 
for a path −→a we write l −→a for the set of linear 
sequences compatible with −→a we say that −→a is straight if 
l −→a ∅ 
for example in figure d-sequence v w x y z is 
linear while v w u y z x w p y z and x v w y z are 
not hence path a b c e and a b d e are both straight 
however path b a d e is not straight 
 
lemma let b c ∈ a and v ∈ db w ∈ dc there is 
a simple path −→a and d-sequence −→u such that −→a −→u ∈ 
lcvw 
bc furthermore for any such path −→a δ −→a ≤ v b − 
v c 
proof by the convexity of d any sequence of points on 
vw is a d-sequence 
if b c singleton path −→a b and d-sequence −→u 
 v w are obviously compatible δ −→a v b − v c 
so assume b c if db ∩dc ∩vw ∅ we pick an arbitrary 
x from this set and let −→a b c ∈ spbc −→u v x w ∈ 
lvw 
 again it is easy to check the compatibility of −→a −→u 
since v ∈ db v b − v c ≥ δbc δ −→a 
for the remaining case b c and db ∩dc ∩vw ∅ notice 
v w otherwise v w ∈ db ∩ dc ∩ vw so we can define 
λx for every point x on vw to be the unique number in 
such that x − λx v λxw for convenience we write 
x ≤ y for λx ≤ λy 
let ia da ∩ vw for each a ∈ a since d ∪a∈ada we 
have vw ∪a∈aia moreover by the convexity of da and 
vw ia is a possibly trivial closed interval 
we begin by considering the case that ib and ic are each 
a single point that is ib v and ic w 
let s be a minimal subset of a satisfying ∪s∈sis vw 
for each s ∈ s is is maximal i e not contained in any 
other it for t ∈ s in particular the intervals is s ∈ 
s have all left endpoints distinct and all right endpoints 
distinct and the order of the left endpoints is the same as 
that of the right endpoints let k s and index s 
as a ak− in the order defined by the right endpoints 
denote the interval iai by li ri thus l l lk− 
r r rk− and the fact that these intervals cover 
vw implies l v rk− w and for all ≤ i ≤ k − 
li ≤ ri which further implies li ri now we define 
the path −→a a a ak− ak with a b ak c 
and a a ak− as above define the linear d-sequence 
−→u u u uk by u u v uk w and for 
 ≤ i ≤ k− ui ri it follows immediately that −→a −→u ∈ 
lcvw 
bc neither b nor c is in s since lb rb and lc rc thus 
−→a is simple 
finally to show δ −→a ≤ v b − v c we note 
v b − v c v a − v ak

for two outcomes d e ∈ a let us define fde z z d −z e 
for all z ∈ d it suffices to show faiai ri ≤ faiai v for 
 ≤ i ≤ k − 
fact for d e ∈ a fde z is a linear function of z 
furthermore if x ∈ dd and y ∈ de with x y then 
fde x x d − x e ≥ δde ≥ −δed ≥ − y e − y d 
fde y therefore fde z is monotonically nonincreasing along 
the line 
←→ 
xy as z moves in the direction from x to y 
applying this fact with d ai e ai x li and y ri 
gives the desired conclusion this completes the proof for 
the case that ib v and ic w 
for general ib ic rb lc otherwise db ∩ dc ∩ vw ib ∩ 
ic ∅ let v rb and w lc clearly we can apply the 
above conclusion to v ∈ db w ∈ dc and get a compatible 
pair −→a −→u ∈ lcv w 
bc with −→a simple and δ −→a ≤ v b − 
v c define the linear d-sequence −→u by u v uk w 
and ui ui for i ∈ k − −→a −→u ∈ lcvw 
bc is evident 
moreover applying the above fact with d b e c x v 
and y w we get v b − v c ≥ v b − v c ≥ δ −→a 
corollary for any b c ∈ a there is a straight b 
c path 
the main result of this section theorem says that for 
any b c ∈ a every straight b c -path has the same δ-weight 
to prove this we first fix v ∈ db and w ∈ dc and show 
 lemma that every straight b c -path compatible with 
some linear v w -sequence has the same δ-weight ρbc v w 
we then show in theorem that ρbc v w is the same for 
all choices of v ∈ db and w ∈ dc 
lemma for b c ∈ a there is a function ρbc db ×

proof let −→a −→u −→a −→u ∈ lcvw

compatible with −→u satisfying δ −→a 
 δ −→a and δ −→a 
 δ −→a 
lemma implies δ −→a 
 δ −→a 
 which will complete the 
proof 
let −→a ord −→u k and −→a ord −→u l we 
select −→u to be any linear v w -sequence u u ut such 
that −→u and −→u are both subsequences of −→u i e there 
are indices i i · · · ik t and j 
j · · · jl t such that −→u ui ui uik and 
−→u uj uj ujl we now construct a b c -path 
−→a 
compatible with −→u such that δ −→a 
 δ −→a an 
analogous construction gives −→a 
compatible with −→u such 
that δ −→a 
 δ −→a this will complete the proof

j ar where 
r is the unique index satisfying ir− j ≤ ir since both

we are now ready for the main theorem of the section 
theorem ρbc is a constant map on db × dc thus 
for any b c ∈ a every straight b c -path has the same 
δweight 
proof for a path −→a v w is compatible with −→a if 
there is a linear v w -sequence compatible with −→a we 
write cp −→a for the set of pairs v w compatible with 
−→a ρbc is constant on cp −→a because for each v w ∈ 
cp −→a ρbc v w δ −→a by lemma we also haves 
−→a ∈spbc 
cp −→a db ×dc since a is finite spbc the set 
of simple paths from b to c is finite as well 
 
next we prove that for any path −→a cp −→a is closed 
let vn 
 wn 
 n ∈ n be a convergent sequence in cp −→a 
and let v w be the limit we want to show that v w ∈ 
cp −→a for each n ∈ n since vn 
 wn 
 ∈ cp −→a there is 
a linear vn 
 wn 
 -sequence un 
compatible with −→a i e there 
are λn 
 ≤ λn

j − λn 
j vn 
 λn 
j wn 
 j k since for each 
n λn 
 λn 
 λn 
 λn 
k belongs to the closed bounded set 
 k 
we can choose an infinite subset i ⊆ n such that the 
sequence λn 
 n ∈ i converges let λ λ λ λk be 
the limit clearly λ ≤ λ ≤ · · · ≤ λk 
define the linear v w -sequence −→u by uj − λj v 
λj w j k then for each j ∈ k uj is 
the limit of the sequence un 
j n ∈ i for j each un 
j 
belongs to the closed set daj so uj ∈ daj similarly for j 
k each un 
j belongs to the closed set daj so uj ∈ daj 
hence −→a −→u is compatible implying v w ∈ cp −→a 
now we have db × dc covered by finitely many closed 
subsets on each of them ρbc is a constant 
suppose for contradiction that there are v w v w ∈ 
db × dc such that ρbc v w ρbc v w 
l − λ v λv − λ w λw λ ∈ 
is a line segment in db ×dc by the convexity of db dc let 
l x y ∈ l ρbc x y ρbc v w 
and l l − l clearly v w ∈ l v w ∈ l let

since it is well known and easy to prove that a line segment

closed sets 
summarizing corollary lemma and theorem we 
have 
corollary for any b c ∈ a there is a real number 
ρbc with the property that there is at least one straight 
 b c -path of δ-weight ρbc and every straight b c -path 
has δ-weight ρbc 
 proof of theorem 
lemma ρbc ≤ δbc for all b c ∈ a 
proof for contradiction suppose ρbc − δbc 
by the definition of δbc there exists v ∈ f− 
 b ⊆ db with 
v b − v c δbc ρbc pick an arbitrary w ∈ dc 
by lemma there is a compatible pair −→a −→u ∈ lcvw 
bc 
with δ −→a ≤ v b − v c since −→a is a straight b c -path 
ρbc δ −→a ≤ v b − v c leading to a contradiction 
define another edge-weighted complete directed graph gf 
on vertex set a where the weight of arc a b is ρab 
immediately from lemma the weight of every directed cycle in 
gf is bounded below by its weight in gf to prove theorem 
 it suffices to show the zero cycle property of gf i e 
every directed cycle has weight zero we begin by considering 
two-cycles 
lemma ρbc ρcb for all b c ∈ a 
proof let −→a be a straight b c -path compatible with 
linear sequence −→u let −→a be the reverse of −→a and −→u the 
reverse of −→u obviously −→a −→u is compatible as well and 
thus −→a is a straight c b -path therefore

where the final equality uses proposition 
next for three cycles we first consider those compatible 
with linear triples 
lemma if there are collinear points u ∈ da v ∈ db 
w ∈ dc a b c ∈ a ρab ρbc ρca 
proof first we prove for the case where v is between u 
and w from lemma there are compatible pairs −→a −→u ∈ 
lcuv 
ab −→a −→u ∈ lcvw 
bc let −→a ord −→u k and 
 −→a ord −→u l we paste −→a and −→a together as 
−→a a a a ak− ak a al c 
−→u and −→u as

therefore ρac δ −→a δ −→a δ −→a ρab ρbc 
moreover ρac −ρca by lemma so we get ρab ρbc 
ρca 
now suppose w is between u and v by the above 
argument we have ρac ρcb ρba and by lemma 
ρab ρbc ρca −ρba − ρcb − ρac 
the case that u is between v and w is similar 
now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property 
lemma ρab ρbc ρca for all a b c ∈ a 
proof let s a b c ρab ρbc ρca and 
for contradiction suppose s ∅ s is finite for each 
a ∈ a choose va ∈ da arbitrarily and let t be the convex 
hull of va a ∈ a for each a b c ∈ s let rabc 
da × db × dc ∩ t 
 clearly each rabc is nonempty and 
compact moreover by lemma no u v w ∈ rabc is 
collinear 
define f d 
→ r by f u v w v−u w−v u−w 
for a b c ∈ s the restriction of f to the compact set rabc 
attains a minimum m a b c at some point u v w ∈ rabc 
by the continuity of f i e there exists a triangle ∆uvw of 
minimum perimeter within t with u ∈ da v ∈ db w ∈ dc 
choose a 
 b 
 c 
 ∈ s so that m a 
 b 
 c 
 is minimum 
and let u 
 v 
 w 
 ∈ ra b c be a triple achieving it pick 
an arbitrary point p in the interior of ∆u 
v 
w 
 by the 
convexity of domain d there is d ∈ a such that p ∈ dd 
 
consider triangles ∆u 
pw 
 ∆w 
pv 
and ∆v 
pu 
 since 
each of them has perimeter less than that of ∆u 
v 
w 
and 
all three triangles are contained in t by the minimality of 
∆u

ρa d ρdc ρc a 
ρc d ρdb ρb c 
ρb d ρda ρa b 
summing up the three equalities 
 ρa d ρdc ρc d ρdb ρb d ρda 
 ρc a ρb c ρa b 
which yields a contradiction 
ρa b ρb c ρc a 
with the zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties the 
zero cycle property of gf is immediate as noted earlier 
this completes the proof of theorem 
theorem every directed cycle of gf has weight zero 
proof clearly zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties 
imply triangle equality ρab ρbc ρac for all a b c ∈ a for 
a directed cycle c a a aka by inductively applying 
triangle equality we have 
pk− 
i ρaiai ρa ak therefore 
the weight of c is

ρaiai ρaka ρa ak ρaka 
as final remarks we note that our result implies the 
following strengthenings of theorem 
corollary for any b c ∈ a every admissible b 
c path has the same δ-weight ρbc 
proof first notice that for any b c ∈ a if db ∩dc ∅ 
δbc ρbc to see this pick v ∈ db ∩ dc arbitrarily 
obviously path −→a b c is compatible with linear sequence 
−→u v v v and is thus a straight b c -path hence 
ρbc δ −→a δbc 
now for any b c ∈ a and any b c -path −→a with c −→a

 counterexamples to stronger 
forms of theorem 
theorem applies to social choice functions with convex 
domain and finite range we now show that neither of these 
hypotheses can be omitted our examples are single player 
functions 
the first example illustrates that convexity can not be 
omitted we present an untruthful single player social choice 
function with three outcomes a b c satisfying w-mon on a 
path-connected but non-convex domain the domain is the 
boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x − y 
 − and z − x and the open line segment 
zx is assigned outcome a y and the open line segment xy 
is assigned outcome b and z and the open line segment 
yz is assigned outcome c clearly δab −δba δbc 
−δcb δca −δac − w-mon the nonnegative 
twocycle property holds since there is a negative cycle δab 
δbc δca − by lemma this is not a truthful choice 
function 
we now show that the hypothesis of finite range can not 
be omitted we construct a family of single player social 
choice functions each having a convex domain and an infinite 
number of outcomes and satisfying weak monotonicity but 
not truthfulness 
our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and 
an n × n matrix m satisfying the following properties 
m is non-singular m is positive semidefinite there 
are distinct i i ik ∈ n satisfying 
k− x 
j 
 m ij ij − m ij ij m ik ik − m ik i 
here is an example matrix with n and i i i

let e e en denote the standard basis of rn 
 let 
sn denote the convex hull of e e en which is the 
set of vectors in rn 
with nonnegative coordinates that sum 
to the range of our social choice function will be the 
set sn and the domain d will be indexed by sn that is 
d yλ λ ∈ sn where yλ is defined below the function 
f maps yλ to λ 
next we specify yλ by definition d must be a set of 
functions from sn to r for λ ∈ sn the domain element 
yλ sn −→ r is defined by yλ α λt 
mα the 
nonsingularity of m guarantees that yλ yµ for λ µ ∈ sn 
it is easy to see that d is a convex subset of the set of all 
functions from sn to r 
the outcome graph gf is an infinite graph whose vertex 
set is the outcome set a sn for outcomes λ µ ∈ a the 
edge weight δλµ is equal to 
δλµ inf v λ − v µ f v λ 
 yλ λ − yλ µ λt 
mλ − λt 
mµ λt 
m λ − µ 
we claim that gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle 
property w-mon but has a negative cycle and hence is not 
truthful 
for outcomes λ µ ∈ a 
δλµ δµλ λt 
m λ−µ µt 
m µ−λ λ−µ t 
m λ−µ 
 
which is nonnegative since m is positive semidefinite hence 
the nonnegative two-cycle property holds next we show 
that gf has a negative cycle let i i ik be a 
sequence of indices satisfying property of m we claim 
ei ei eik ei is a negative cycle since

 m ij ij − m ij ij m ik ik − m ik i 
which completes the proof 
finally we point out that the third property imposed on 
the matrix m has the following interpretation let r m 
 r r rn be the set of row vectors of m and let hm be 
the single player social choice function with domain r m 
and range n mapping ri to i property is 
equivalent to the condition that the outcome graph ghm has a 
negative cycle by lemma this is equivalent to the 
condition that hm is untruthful 
 future work 
as stated in the introduction the goal underlying the 
work in this paper is to obtain useful and general 
characterizations of truthfulness 
let us say that a set d of p × a real valuation matrices 
is a wm-domain if any social choice function on d 
satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful in this paper we showed 
that for finite a any convex d is a wm-domain typically 
the domains of social choice functions considered in 
mechanism design are convex but there are interesting examples 
with non-convex domains e g combinatorial auctions with 
unknown single-minded bidders it is intriguing to find the 
most general conditions under which a set d of real 
matrices is a wm-domain we believe that convexity is the main 
part of the story i e a wm-domain is after excluding some 
exceptional cases essentially a convex set 
turning to parametric representations let us say a set 
d of p × a matrices is an am-domain if any truthful 
social choice function with domain d is an affine maximizer 
roberts theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an 
am-domain what are the most general conditions under 
which a set d of real matrices is an am-domain
