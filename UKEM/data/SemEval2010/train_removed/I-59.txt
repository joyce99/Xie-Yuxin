abstract 
recommender systems are used in various domains to 
generate personalized information based on personal user data 
the ability to preserve the privacy of all participants is an 
essential requirement of the underlying information filtering 
architectures because the deployed recommender systems 
have to be accepted by privacy-aware users as well as 
information and service providers existing approaches neglect 
to address privacy in this multilateral way 
we have developed an approach for privacy-preserving 
recommender systems based on multi-agent system 
technology which enables applications to generate 
recommendations via various filtering techniques while preserving the 
privacy of all participants we describe the main modules of 
our solution as well as an application we have implemented 
based on this approach

 introduction 
information filtering if systems aim at countering 
information overload by extracting information that is 
relevant for a given user out of a large body of information 
available via an information provider in contrast to 
information retrieval ir systems where relevant information 
is extracted based on search queries if architectures 
generate personalized information based on user profiles 
containing for each given user personal data preferences and 
rated items the provided body of information is usually 
structured and collected in provider profiles filtering 
techniques operate on these profiles in order to generate 
recommendations of items that are probably relevant for a given 
user or in order to determine users with similar interests 
or both depending on the respective goal the resulting 
systems constitute recommender systems matchmaker 
systems or a combination thereof 
the aspect of privacy is an essential issue in all if systems 
generating personalized information obviously requires the 
use of personal data according to surveys indicating major 
privacy concerns of users in the context of recommender 
systems and e-commerce in general users can be 
expected to be less reluctant to provide personal information 
if they trust the system to be privacy-preserving with regard 
to personal data similar considerations also apply to the 
information provider who may want to control the 
dissemination of the provided information and to the provider of the 
filtering techniques who may not want the details of the 
utilized filtering algorithms to become common knowledge a 
privacy-preserving if system should therefore balance these 
requirements and protect the privacy of all parties involved 
in a multilateral way while addressing general requirements 
regarding performance security and quality of the 
recommendations as well as described in the following section 
there are several approaches with similar goals but none of 
these provide a generic approach in which the privacy of all 
parties is preserved 
we have developed an agent-based approach for 
privacypreserving if which has been utilized for realizing a 
combined recommender matchmaker system as part of an 
application supporting users in planning entertainment-related 
activities in this paper we focus on the recommender 
system functionality our approach is based on multi-agent 
system mas technology because fundamental features of 
agents such as autonomy adaptability and the ability to 
communicate are essential requirements of our approach in 
other words the realized approach does not merely 
constitute a solution for privacy-preserving if within a mas 
context but rather utilizes a mas architecture in order to 
realize a solution for privacy-preserving if which could not 
be realized easily otherwise 
the paper is structured as follows section describes 
related work section describes the general ideas of our 
approach in section we describe essential details of the 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
modules of our approach and their implementation in 
section we evaluate the approach mainly via the realized 
application section concludes the paper with an outlook 
and outlines further work 
 related work 
there is a large amount of work in related areas such as 
private information retrieval privacy-preserving data 
mining and other privacy-preserving protocols 
most of which is based on secure multi-party computation 
 we have ruled out secure multi-party computation 
approaches mainly because of their complexity and because 
the algorithm that is computed securely is not considered to 
be private in these approaches 
various enforcement mechanisms have been suggested 
that are applicable in the context of privacy-preserving 
information filtering such as enterprise privacy policies 
or hippocratic databases both of which annotate user 
data with additional meta-information specifying how the 
data is to be handled on the provider side these approaches 
ultimately assume that the provider actually intends to 
protect the privacy of the user data and offer support for this 
task but they are not intended to prevent the provider 
from acting in a malicious manner trusted computing as 
specified by the trusted computing group aims at 
realizing trusted systems by increasing the security of open 
systems to a level comparable with the level of security that 
is achievable in closed systems it is based on a 
combination of tamper-proof hardware and various software 
components some example applications including peer-to-peer 
networks distributed firewalls and distributed computing 
in general are listed in 
there are some approaches for privacy-preserving 
recommender systems based on distributed collaborative filtering 
in which recommendations are generated via a public model 
aggregating the distributed user profiles without containing 
explicit information about user profiles themselves this 
is achieved via secure multi-party computation or via 
random perturbation of the user data in 
various approaches are integrated within a single architecture 
in an agent-based approach is described in which user 
agents representing similar users are discovered via a 
transitive traversal of user agents privacy is preserved through 
pseudonymous interaction between the agents and through 
adding obfuscating data to personal information more 
recent related approaches are described in 
in an agent-based architecture for privacy-preserving 
demographic filtering is described which may be 
generalized in order to support other kinds of filtering techniques 
while in some aspects similar to our approach this 
architecture addresses at least two aspects inadequately namely 
the protection of the filter against manipulation attempts 
and the prevention of collusions between the filter and the 
provider 
 privacy-preserving 
information filtering 
we identify three main abstract entities participating in 
an information filtering process within a distributed system 
a user entity a provider entity and a filter entity whereas 
in some applications the provider and filter entities 
explicitly trust each other because they are deployed by the same 
party our solution is applicable more generically because it 
does not require any trust between the main abstract 
entities in this paper we focus on aspects related to the 
information filtering process itself and omit all aspects 
related to information collection and processing i e the stages 
in which profiles are generated and maintained mainly 
because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy as 
they involve fewer different entities 
 requirements 
our solution aims at meeting the following requirements 
with regard to privacy 
 user privacy no linkable information about user 
profiles should be acquired permanently by any other 
entity or external party including other user entities 
single user profile items however may be acquired 
permanently if they are unlinkable i e if they 
cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other 
user profile items temporary acquisition of private 
information is permitted as well sets of 
recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider 
but they should not be linkable to a specific user 
these concessions simplify the resulting protocol and 
allow the provider to obtain recommendations and 
single unlinkable user profile items and thus to determine 
frequently requested information and optimize the 
offered information accordingly 
 provider privacy no information about provider 
profiles with the exception of the recommendations 
should be acquired permanently by other entities or 
external parties again temporary acquisition of 
private information is permitted additionally the 
propagation of provider information is entirely under the 
control of the provider thus the provider is enabled 
to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale 
extraction of information 
 filter privacy details of the algorithms applied by 
the filtering techniques should not be acquired 
permanently by any other entity or external party general 
information about the algorithm may be provided by 
the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach 
a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering 
technique 
in addition general requirements regarding the quality 
of the recommendations as well as security aspects 
performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be 
addressed as well while minor trade-offs may be acceptable 
the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular 
recommender systems with regard to these requirements 
 outline of the solution 
the basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these 
privacy-related requirements in recommender systems is 
implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private 
information see for the original approach user and 
provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to 
the filter entity the filter entity provides the 
recommendations and subsequently deletes all private information thus 
fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition 
of private information 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the entities whose private information is propagated have 
to be certain that the respective information is actually 
acquired temporarily only trust in this regard may be 
established in two main ways 
 trusted software the respective entity itself is trusted 
to remove the respective information as specified 
 trusted environment the respective entity operates 
in an environment that is trusted to control the 
communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent 
that the removal of the respective information may 
be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the 
entity itself additionally the environment itself is 
trusted not to act in a malicious manner e g it is 
trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective 
information itself 
in both cases trust may be established in various ways 
reputation-based mechanisms additional trusted third 
parties certifying entities or environments or trusted 
computing mechanisms may be used our approach is based on a 
trusted environment realized via trusted computing 
mechanisms because we see this solution as the most generic 
and realistic approach this decision is discussed briefly in 
section 
we are now able to specify the abstract information 
filtering protocol as shown in figure the filter entity deploys a 
temporary filter entity tfe operating in a trusted 
environment the user entity deploys an additional relay entity 
operating in the same environment through mechanisms 
provided by this environment the relay entity is able to 
control the communication of the tfe and the provider entity 
is able to control the communication of both relay entity 
and the tfe thus it is possible to ensure that the 
controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations 
but no other private information in the first stage steps 
 to of figure the relay entity establishes control of 
the tfe and thus prevents it from propagating user profile 
information user profile data is propagated without 
participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the 
tfe via the relay entity in the second stage steps to 
 of figure the provider entity establishes control of 
both relay and tfe and thus prevents them from 
propagating provider profile information provider profile data is 
propagated from the provider entity to the tfe via the 
relay entity in the third stage steps to of figure 
the tfe returns the recommendations via the relay entity 
and the controlled entities are terminated taken together 
these steps ensure that all private information is acquired 
temporarily only by the other main entities the problems 
of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and 
ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed 
in the following section 
our approach requires each entity in the distributed 
architecture to have the following five main abilities the ability 
to perform certain well-defined tasks such as carrying out a 
filtering process with a high degree of autonomy i e largely 
independent of other entities e g because the respective 
entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner 
the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined 
environment the ability to communicate with other entities 
the ability to achieve protection against external 
manipulation attempts and the ability to control and restrict the 
communication of other entities 
figure the abstract privacy-preserving 
information filtering protocol all communication across 
the environments indicated by dashed lines is 
prevented with the exception of communication with 
the controlling entity 
mas architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a 
distributed system characterized by these features because 
they provide agents constituting entities that are actually 
characterized by autonomy mobility and the ability to 
communicate as well as agent platforms as environments 
providing means to realize the security of agents in this 
context the issue of malicious hosts i e hosts attacking 
agents has to be addressed explicitly furthermore existing 
mas architectures generally do not allow agents to control 
the communication of other agents it is possible however 
to expand a mas architecture and to provide designated 
agents with this ability for these reasons our solution is 
based on a fipa -compliant mas architecture the 
entities introduced above are mapped directly to agents and 
the trusted environment in which they exist is realized in 
the form of agent platforms 
in addition to the mas architecture itself which is 
assumed as given our solution consists of the following five 
main modules 
 the controller module described in section 
provides functionality for controlling the communication 
capabilities of agents 
 the transparent persistence module facilitates 
the use of different data storage mechanisms and 
provides a uniform interface for accessing persistent 
information which may be utilized for monitoring critical 
interactions involving potentially private information 
e g as part of queries its description is outside the 
scope of this paper 
 the recommender module details of which are 
described in section provides recommender system 
functionality 
 the matchmaker module provides matchmaker 
system functionality it additionally utilizes social 
aspects of mas technology its description is outside the 
scope of this paper 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 finally a separate module described in section 
provides exemplary filtering techniques in order 
to show that various restrictions imposed on filtering 
techniques by our approach may actually be fulfilled 
the trusted environment introduced above encompasses 
the mas architecture itself and the controller module 
which have to be trusted to act in a non-malicious manner 
in order to rule out the possibility of malicious hosts 
 main modules and 
implementation 
in this section we describe the main modules of our 
approach and outline the implementation while we have 
chosen a specific architecture for the implementation the 
specification of the module is applicable to any fipa-compliant 
mas architecture a module basically encompasses 
ontologies functionality provided by agents via agent services and 
internal functionality throughout this paper m kx 
denotes a message m encrypted via a non-specified symmetric 
encryption scheme with a secret key kx used for 
encryption and decryption which is initially known only to 
participant x a key kxy is a key shared by participants 
x and y a cryptographic hash function is used at 
various points of the protocol i e a function returning a hash 
value h x for given data x that is both preimage-resistant 
and collision-resistant 
 we denote a set of hash values for 
a data set x x xn as h x h x h xn 
whereas h x denotes a single hash value of a data set 
 controller module 
as noted above the ability to control the communication 
of agents is generally not a feature of existing mas 
architectures 
but at the same time a central requirement of our 
approach for privacy-preserving information filtering the 
required functionality cannot be realized based on regular 
agent services or components because an agent on a 
platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of 
other agents in any way therefore we add additional 
infrastructure providing the required functionality to the mas 
architecture itself resulting in an agent environment with 
extended functionality and responsibilities 
controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is 
realized by restricting via rules in a manner similar to a 
firewall but with the consent of the respective agent its 
incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms 
or agents on external platforms as well as other possible 
communication channels such as the file system consent 
is required because otherwise the overall security would be 
compromised as attackers could arbitrarily block various 
communication channels our approach does not require 
controlling the communication between agents on the same 
platform and therefore this aspect is not addressed 
consequently all rules addressing communication capabilities 
have to be enforced across entire platforms because 
otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 
 
in the implementation we have used the advanced 
encryption standard aes as the symmetric encryption scheme 
and sha- as the cryptographic hash function 
 
a recent survey on agent environments concludes that 
aspects related to agent environments are often neglected 
and does not indicate any existing work in this particular 
area 
on the same platform as a relay for communicating with 
agents residing on external platforms various agent services 
provide functionality for adding and revoking control of 
platforms including functionality required in complex scenarios 
where controlled agents in turn control further platforms 
the implementation of the actual control mechanism 
depends on the actual mas architecture in our 
implementation we have utilized methods provided via the java 
security manager as part of the java security model thus 
the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security 
policies thereby granting or denying other agents access to 
resources required for communication with other agents as 
well as communication in general such as files or sockets for 
tcp ip-based communication 
 recommender module 
the recommender module is mainly responsible for 
carrying out information filtering processes according to the 
protocol described in table the participating entities are 
realized as agents and the interactions as agent services we 
assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are 
available within the respective mas architecture two 
issues have to be addressed in this module the relevant parts 
of the provider profile have to be retrieved without 
compromising the user s privacy and the recommendations have to 
be propagated in a privacy-preserving way 
our solution is based on a threat model in which no main 
abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity 
to act in an honest manner each entity has to assume that 
other entities may attempt to obtain private information 
either while following the specified protocol or even by 
deviating from the protocol according to we classify the 
former case as honest-but-curious behavior as an example 
the tfe may propagate recommendations as specified but 
may additionally attempt to propagate private information 
and the latter case as malicious behavior as an example the 
filter may attempt to propagate private information instead 
of the recommendations 
 retrieving the provider profile 
as outlined above the relay agent relays data between 
the tfe agent and the provider agent these agents are 
not allowed to communicate directly because the tfe agent 
cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner unlike the 
user profile which is usually rather small the provider 
profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole 
efficiently a typical example is a user profile containing 
ratings of about movies while the provider profile 
contains some movies retrieving only the relevant part 
of the provider profile however is problematic because it 
has to be done without leaking sensitive information about 
the user profile therefore the relay agent has to analyze all 
queries on the provider profile and reject potentially critical 
queries such as queries containing a set of user profile items 
because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile 
items is assumed to be uncritical we extend the 
information filtering protocol as follows the relevant parts of the 
provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous 
interactions between the relay and the provider if the mas 
architecture used for the implementation does not provide 
an infrastructure for anonymous agent communication this 
feature has to be provided explicitly the most 
straightforward way is to use additional relay agents deployed via 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
table the basic information filtering protocol 
with participants u user agent p provider 
agent f tfe agent r relay agent based on the 
abstract protocol shown in figure up denotes the 
user profile with up up upn pp denotes the 
provider profile and rec denotes the set of 
recommendations with rec rec recm

the main relay agent and used once for a single anonymous 
interaction obviously unlinkability is only achieved if 
multiple instances of the protocol are executed simultaneously 
between the provider and different users because agents 
on controlled platforms are unable to communicate 
anonymously with the respective controlling agent control has to 
be established after the anonymous interactions have been 
completed to prevent the uncontrolled relay agents from 
propagating provider profile data the respective data is 
encrypted and the key is provided only after control has been 
established therefore the second phase of the protocol 
described in table is replaced as described in table 
additionally the relay agent may allow other interactions 
as long as no user profile items are used within the queries 
in this case the relay agent has to ensure that the provider 
does not obtain any information exceeding the information 
deducible via the recommendations themselves the 
clusterbased filtering technique described in section is an 
example for a filtering technique operating in this manner 
 recommendation propagation 
the propagation of the recommendations is even more 
problematic mainly because more participants are involved 
recommendations have to be propagated from the tfe 
agent via the relay and provider agent to the user agent no 
participant should be able to alter the recommendations or 
use them for the propagation of private information 
therefore every participant in this chain has to obtain and verify 
the recommendations in unencrypted form prior to the next 
agent in the chain i e the relay agent has to verify the 
recommendations before the provider obtains them and so on 
therefore the final phase of the protocol described in table 
 is replaced as described in table it basically consists of 
two parts step to and step to step each of 
which provide a solution for a problem related to the 
prisoners problem in which two participants the prisoners 
intend to exchange a message via a third untrusted 
participant the warden who may read the message but must not 
be able to alter it in an undetectable manner there are 
various solutions for protocols addressing the prisoners

lem the more obvious of these however such as protocols 
based on the use of digital signatures introduce additional 
threats e g via the possibility of additional subliminal 
channels in order to minimize the risk of possible threats 
we have decided to use a protocol that only requires a 
symmetric encryption scheme 
the first part of the final phase is carried out as follows 
in order to prevent the relay from altering 
recommendations they are propagated by the filter together with an 
encrypted hash in step thus the relay is able to verify 
the recommendations before they are propagated further 
the relay however may suspect the data propagated as 
the encrypted hash to contain private information instead 
of the actual hash value therefore the encrypted hash is 
encrypted again and propagated together with a hash on 
the respective key in step in step the key kp f 
is revealed to the relay allowing the relay to validate the 
encrypted hash in step the key kr is revealed to the 
provider allowing the provider to decrypt the data received 
in step and thus to obtain h rec propagating the 
hash of the key kr prevents the relay from altering the 
recommendations to rec after step which would be 
undetectable otherwise because the relay could choose a key 
kr so that h rec kpf kr h rec kpf kr 
 
the encryption scheme used for encrypting the hash has to 
be secure against known-plaintext attacks because 
otherwise the relay may be able to obtain kp f after step and 
subsequently alter the recommendations in an undetectable 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
way additionally the encryption scheme must not be 
commutative for similar reasons 
the remaining protocol steps are interactions between 
relay provider and user agent the interactions of step 
to step ensure via the same mechanisms used in step 
 to that the provider is able to analyze the 
recommendations before the user obtains them but at the same 
time prevent the provider from altering the 
recommendations additionally the recommendations are not processed 
at once but rather one at a time to prevent the provider 
from withholding all recommendations 
upon completion of the protocol both user and provider 
have obtained a set of recommendations if the user wants 
these recommendations to be unlinkable to himself the user 
agent has to carry out the entire protocol anonymously 
again the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use 
additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are 
used once for a single information filtering process 
 exemplary filtering techniques 
the filtering technique applied by the tfe agent cannot 
be chosen freely all collaboration-based approaches such 
as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles 
of a set of users are not applicable because the provider 
profile does not contain user profile data unless this data 
has been collected externally instead these approaches 
are realized via the matchmaker module which is outside 
the scope of this paper learning-based approaches are not 
applicable because the tfe agent cannot propagate any 
acquired data to the filter which effectively means that the 
filter is incapable of learning filtering techniques that are 
actually applicable are feature-based approaches such as 
content-based filtering in which profile items are compared 
via their attributes and knowledge-based filtering in which 
domain-specific knowledge is applied in order to match user 
and provider profile items an overview of different classes 
and hybrid combinations of filtering techniques is given in 
 we have implemented two generic content-based 
filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach 
a direct content-based filtering technique based on the 
class of item-based top-n recommendation algorithms is 
used in cases where the user profile contains items that are 
also contained in the provider profile in a preprocessing 
stage i e prior to the actual information filtering processes 
a model is generated containing the k most similar items for 
each provider profile item while computationally rather 
complex this approach is feasible because it has to be done 
only once and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way 
via interactions between the provider agent and a tfe 
agent the resulting model is stored by the provider agent 
and can be seen as an additional part of the provider 
profile in the actual information filtering process the k most 
similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item 
via queries on the model as described in section this 
is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous 
communication recommendations are generated by selecting 
the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not 
already contained within the user profile 
as an alternative approach applicable when the user 
profile contains information in addition to provider profile 
items we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider 
profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an 
agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach each cluster is 
represented by a centroid item and the cluster elements are 
either sub-clusters or on the lowest level the items 
themselves in the information filtering stage the relevant items 
are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in 
the following manner the cluster items of the highest level 
are retrieved independent of the user profile by 
comparing these items with the user profile data the most relevant 
sub-clusters are determined and retrieved in a subsequent 
iteration this process is repeated until the lowest level 
is reached which contains the items themselves as 
recommendations throughout the process user profile items are 
never propagated to the provider as such the 
information deducible about the user profile does not exceed the 
information deducible via the recommendations themselves 
 because essentially only a chain of cluster centroids leading 
to the recommendations is retrieved and therefore it is not 
regarded as privacy-critical 
 implementation 
we have implemented the approach for privacy-preserving 
if based on jiac iv a fipa-compliant mas 
architecture jiac iv integrates fundamental aspects of 
autonomous agents regarding pro-activeness intelligence 
communication capabilities and mobility by providing a scalable 
component-based architecture additionally jiac iv offers 
components realizing management and security 
functionality and provides a methodology for agent-oriented 
software engineering jiac iv stands out among mas 
architectures as the only security-certified architecture since it 
has been certified by the german federal office for 
information security according to the eal of the common criteria 
for information technology security standard jiac iv 
offers several security features in the areas of access control 
for agent services secure communication between agents 
and low-level security based on java security policies 
and thus provides all security-related functionality required 
for our approach 
we have extended the jiac iv architecture by adding the 
mechanisms for communication control described in section 
 regarding the issue of malicious hosts we currently 
assume all providers of agent platforms to be trusted we 
are additionally developing a solution that is actually based 
on a trusted computing infrastructure 
 evaluation 
for the evaluation of our approach we have examined 
whether and to which extent the requirements mainly 
regarding privacy performance and quality are actually met 
privacy aspects are directly addressed by the modules and 
protocols described above and therefore not evaluated 
further here performance is a critical issue mainly because of 
the overhead caused by creating additional agents and agent 
platforms for controlling communication and by the 
additional interactions within the recommender module 
overall a single information filtering process takes about ten 
times longer than a non-privacy-preserving information 
filtering process leading to the same results which is a 
considerable overhead but still acceptable under certain conditions 
as described in the following section 
 the smart event assistant 
as a proof of concept and in order to evaluate 
performance and quality under real-life conditions we have

 figure shows a screenshot of the

the functionality provided by our approach 
recommendations are generated in two ways a push 
service delivers new recommendations to the user in regular 
intervals e g once per day via email or sms because the 
user is not online during these interactions they are less 
critical with regard to performance and the protracted 
duration of the information filtering process is acceptable in 
this case recommendations generated for the intelligent 
day planner however have to be delivered with very little 
latency because the process is triggered by the user who 
expects to receive results promptly in this scenario the 
overall performance is substantially improved by setting up 
the relay agent and the tfe agent oÔ¨Ñine i e prior to the

part of the provider profile because the user is only 
interested in items such as movies available within a certain 
time period and related to specific locations such as 
screenings at cinemas in a specific city the relevant part of the 
provider profile is usually small enough to be propagated 
entirely because these additional parameters are not seen 
as privacy-critical as they are not based on the user 
profile but rather constitute a short-term information need 
the relevant part of the provider profile may be propagated 
as a whole with no need for complex interactions taken 
together these improvements result in a filtering process 
that takes about three times as long as the respective 
nonprivacy-preserving filtering process which we regard as an 
acceptable trade-off for the increased level of privacy table 
 shows the results of the performance evaluation in more 
detail in these scenarios a direct content-based filtering 
technique similar to the one described in section is 
applied because equivalent filtering techniques have been 
applied successfully in regular recommender systems there 
are no negative consequences with regard to the quality of 
the recommendations 
 alternative approaches 
as described in section our solution is based on 
trusted computing there are more straightforward ways 
to realize privacy-preserving if e g by utilizing a 
centralized architecture in which the privacy-preserving 
providerside functionality is realized as trusted software based on 
trusted computing however we consider these approaches 
to be unsuitable because they are far less generic whenever 
some part of the respective software is patched upgraded or 
replaced the entire system has to be analyzed again in order 
to determine its trustworthiness a process that is 
problematic in itself due to its complexity in our solution only a 
comparatively small part of the overall system is based on 
trusted computing because agent platforms can be utilized 
for a large variety of tasks and because we see trusted 
computing as the most promising approach to realize secure and 
trusted agent environments it seems reasonable to assume 
that these respective mechanisms will be generally available 
in the future independent of specific solutions such as the 
one described here

 conclusion further work 
we have developed an agent-based approach for 
privacypreserving recommender systems by utilizing 
fundamental features of agents such as autonomy adaptability and 
the ability to communicate by extending the capabilities 
of agent platform managers regarding control of agent 
communication by providing a privacy-preserving protocol for 
information filtering processes and by utilizing suitable 
filtering techniques we have been able to realize an approach 
which actually preserves privacy in information filtering 
architectures in a multilateral way as a proof of concept we 
have used the approach within an application supporting 
users in planning entertainment-related activities 
we envision various areas of future work to achieve 
complete user privacy the protocol should be extended in order 
to keep the recommendations themselves private as well 
generally the feedback we have obtained from users of the 
smart event assistant indicates that most users are 
indifferent to privacy in the context of entertainment-related 
personal information therefore we intend to utilize the 
approach to realize a recommender system in a more 
privacysensitive domain such as health or finance which would 
enable us to better evaluate user acceptance
