 introduction 
recently global networks have attracted widespread study 
the emergence of popular scalable shared networks with 
self-interested entities - such as peer-to-peer systems over 
the internet and mobile wireless communication ad-hoc 
networks - poses fundamental challenges 
naturally the study of such giant decentralized systems 
involves aspects of game theory in particular the 
subfield of mechanism design deals with the construction 
of mechanisms for a given social goal the challenge is to 
design rules for interaction such that selfish behavior of the 
agents will result in the desired social goal 
algorithmic mechanism design amd focuses on 
efficiently computable constructions distributed 
algorithmic mechanism design damd studies mechanism design 
in inherently decentralized settings the standard 
model assumes rational agents with quasi-linear utilities and 
private information playing dominant strategies 
the solution concept of dominant strategies - in which 
each player has a best response strategy regardless of the 
strategy played by any other player - is well suited to the 
assumption of private information in which each player is 
not assumed to have knowledge or beliefs regarding the other 
players the appropriateness of this set-up stems from the 
strength of the solution concept which complements the 
weak information assumption many mechanisms have been 
constructed using this set-up e g most 
of these apply to severely-restricted cases e g single-item 
auctions with no externalities in which a player s 
preference is described by only one parameter single-parameter 
domains 
to date vickrey-clarke-groves vcg mechanisms are 
the only known general method for designing dominant 
strategy mechanisms for general domains of preferences 
however in distributed settings without available subsidies from 
outside sources vcg mechanisms cannot be accepted as 
valid solutions due to a serious lack of budget balance 
additionally for some domains of preferences vcg mechanisms 
and weighted vcg mechanisms are faced with 
computational hardness further limitations of the set-up 
are discussed in subsection 
in most distributed environments players can take 
advantage of the network structure to collect and distribute 
information about other players this paper thus studies 
the effects of relaxing the private information assumption 
 
one model that has been extensively studied recently is 
the peer-to-peer p p network a p p network is a 
distributed network with no centralized authority in which the 
participants share their individual resources e g 
processing power storage capacity bandwidth and content the 
aggregation of such resources provides inexpensive 
computational platforms the most popular p p networks are 
those for sharing media files such as napster gnutella and 
kazaa recent work on p p incentives include 
micropayment methods and reputation-based methods 
the following description of a p p network scenario 
illustrates the relevance of our relaxed informational assumption 
example consider a peer-to-peer network for file 
sharing whenever agent b uploads a file from agent a all peers 
along the routing path know that b has loaded the file they 
can record this information about agent b in addition they 
can distribute this information 
however it is impossible to record all the information 
everywhere first such duplication induces huge costs 
second as agents dynamically enter and exit from the network 
the information might not be always available and so it is 
seems natural to consider environments in which the 
information is locally recorded that is the information is recorded 
in the closest neighborhood with some probability p 
in this paper we shall see that if the information is 
available with some probability then this enables us to 
implement a wider range of social goals as a result cooperation 
is achieved independent of agents belief this demonstrates 
that in some computational contexts our approach is far less 
demanding than the bayesian approach that assumes that 
players types are drawn according to some identified 
probability density function 
 implementations in complete information 
set-ups 
in complete information environments each agent is 
informed about everyone else that is each agent observes his 
own preference and the preferences of all other agents 
however no outsider can observe this information specifically 
neither the mechanism designer nor the court many 
positive results were shown for such arguably realistic settings 
for recent surveys see 
moore and repullo implement a large class of social goals 
using sequential mechanisms with a small number of rounds 
 the concept they used is subgame-perfect 
implementations spe 
the spe-implementability concept seems natural for the 
following reasons the designed mechanisms usually have 
non-artificial constructs and a small strategy space as 
a result it is straightforward for a player to compute his 
strategy 
second sequential mechanisms avoid 
simultaneous moves and thus can be considered for distributed 
networks third the constructed mechanisms are often 
decentralized i e lacking a centralized authority or designer 
 
interestingly in real life players do not always use their 
subgame perfect strategies one such widely studied case is the 
ultimatum bargaining -person game in this simple game 
the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain 
known sum of money and the responder either agrees or 
refuses in the latter case both players earn zero somewhat 
surprisingly experiments show that the responder often 
rejects the suggested offer even if it is bounded away from 
zero and the game is played only once see e g 
and budget-balanced i e transfers always sum up to zero 
this happens essentially if there are at least three players 
and a direct network link between any two agents finally 
moore and repullo observed that they actually use a 
relaxed complete information assumption it is only required 
that for every player there exists only one other player who 
is informed about him 
 implementations in partially informed 
set-ups and our results 
the complete information assumption is realistic for small 
groups of players but not in general in this paper we 
consider players that are informed about each other with 
some probability more formally we say that agent b is 
p-informed about agent a if b knows the type of a with 
probability p 
for such partially-informed environments we show how to 
use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly 
dominated strategies we demonstrate this concept through 
some motivating examples that i seem natural in distributed 
settings and ii cannot be implemented in dominant 
strategies even if there is an authorized center with a direct 
connection to every agent or even if players have single-parameter 
domains 
 we first show how the subgame perfect techniques of 
moore and repullo can be applied to p-informed 
environments and further adjusted to the concept of 
iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies 
 for large enough p 
 we then suggest a certificate based challenging method 
that is more natural in computerized p-informed 
environments and different from the one introduced by 
moore and repullo for p ∈ 
 we consider implementations in various network 
structures 
as a case study we apply our methods to derive 
simplified peer-to-peer network for file sharing with no 
payments in equilibrium our approach is agent file -specific 
 web-cache budget-balanced and economically efficient 
mechanism 
our mechanisms use reasonable punishments that inversely 
depend on p and so if the fines are large then small p is 
enough to induce cooperation essentially large p implies a 
large amount of recorded information 
 malicious agents 
decentralized mechanisms often utilize punishing outcomes 
as a result malicious players might cause severe harm to 
others we suggest a quantified notion of malicious player 
who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm 
caused to others suggests several categories to classify 
non-cooperating players our approach is similar to and 
the references therein who considered independently such 
players in different context we show a simple 
decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and 
in particular do not use their punishing actions in 
equilibrium 
 
 dominant strategy implementations 
in this subsection we shall refer to some recent results 
demonstrating that the set-up of private information with 
the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general 
first roberts classical impossibility result shows that if 
players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 
 different outcomes then every dominant-strategy 
mechanism must be weighted vcg with the social goal that 
maximizes the weighted welfare for slightly-restricted 
preference domains it is not known how to turn efficiently 
computable algorithms into dominant strategy mechanisms 
this was observed and analyzed in recently 
extends roberts result to some leading examples they 
showed that under mild assumptions any dominant 
strategy mechanism for variety of combinatorial auctions over 
multi-dimensional domains must be almost weighted vcg 
additionally it turns out that the dominant strategy 
requirement implies that the social goal must be monotone 
 this condition is very restrictive as 
many desired natural goals are non-monotone 
 
several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant 
strategy concept however most 
of these positive results either apply to severely restricted 
cases e g single-parameter players or amount to vcg 
or almost vcg mechanisms e g recently 
considered implementations for generalized single-parameter 
players 
organization of this paper in section we illustrate 
the concepts of subgame perfect and iterative elimination 
of weakly dominated strategies in completely-informed and 
partially-informed environments in section we show a 
mechanism for peer-to-peer file sharing networks in section 
 we apply our methods to derive a web cache mechanism 
future work is briefly discussed in section 
 motivating examples 
in this section we examine the concepts of subgame perfect 
and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies for 
completely informed and p-informed environments we also 
present the notion of q-maliciousness and some other related 
considerations through two illustrative examples 
 the fair assignment problem 
our first example is an adjustment to computerized 
context of an ancient procedure to ensure that the wealthiest 
man in athens would sponsor a theatrical production known 
as the choregia in the fair assignment problem alice 
and bob are two workers and there is a new task to be 
performed their goal is to assign the task to the least loaded 
worker without any monetary transfers the informational 
assumption is that alice and bob know both loads and the 
duration of the new task 
 
e g minimizing the makespan within a factor of and 
rawls rule over some multi-dimensional domains 
 
in first glance one might ask why the completely informed 
agents could not simply sign a contract specifying the 
desired goal such a contract is sometimes infeasible due to 
fact that the true state cannot be observed by outsiders 
especially not the court 
claim the fair assignment goal cannot be implemented 
in dominant strategies 
 basic mechanism 
the following simple mechanism implements this goal in 
subgame perfect equilibrium 
 stage alice either agrees to perform the new task 
or refuses 
 stage if she refuses bob has to choose between 
- a performing the task himself 
- b exchanging his load with alice and 
performing the new task as well 
let lt 
a lt 
b be the true loads of alice and bob and let 
t be the load of the new task assume that load 
exchanging takes zero time and cost we shall see that the 
basic mechanism achieves the goal in a subgame perfect 
equilibrium intuitively this means that in equilibrium each 
player will choose his best action at each point he might 
reach assuming similar behavior of others and thus every 
spe is a nash equilibrium 
claim the task is assigned to the least loaded 
worker in subgame perfect equilibrium 
proof by backward induction argument look forward 
and reason backward consider the following cases 
 lt 
b ≤ lt 
a if stage is reached then bob will not 
exchange 
 lt 
a lt 
b lt 
a t if stage is reached bob will 
exchange and this is what alice prefers 
 lt 
a t ≤ lt 
b if stage is reached then bob would 
exchange as a result it is strictly preferable by alice 
to perform the task 
note that the basic mechanism does not use monetary 
transfers at all and is decentralized in the sense that no third 
party is needed to run the procedure the goal is achieved in 
equilibrium ties are broken in favor of alice however in 
the second case exchange do occur in an equilibrium point 
recall the unrealistic assumption that load exchange takes 
zero time and cost introducing fines the next mechanism 
overcomes this drawback 
 elicitation mechanism 
in this subsection we shall see a centralized mechanism for 
the fair assignment goal without load exchange in 
equilibrium the additional assumptions are as follows the cost 
performing a load of duration d is exactly d we assume 
that the duration t of the new task is t the payoffs 
 
proof assume that there exists a mechanism that 
implements this goal in dominant strategies then by the 
revelation principle there exists a mechanism that implements 
this goal for which the dominant strategy of each player is 
to report his true load clearly truthfully reporting cannot 
be a dominant strategy for this goal if monetary transfers 
are not available as players would prefer to report higher 
loads 
 
of the utility maximizers agents are quasilinear the 
following mechanism is an adaptation of moore and repullo s 
elicitation mechanism 
 
 stage elicitation of alice s load 
alice announces la 
bob announces la ≤ la 
if la la bob agrees goto the next stage 
otherwise bob challenges alice is assigned the 
task 
she then has to choose between 
- a transferring her original load to bob and 
paying him la − · min la − la 
alice pays to the mechanism 
bob pays the fine of t to the mechanism 
- b no load transfer alice pays to bob stop 
 stage the elicitation of bob s load is similar to 
stage switching the roles of alice and bob 
 stage if la lb alice is assigned the task 
otherwise bob stop 
observe that alice is assigned the task and fined with 
whenever bob challenges we shall see that the bonus of 
is paid to a challenging player only in out of equilibria cases 
claim if the mechanism stops at stage then the 
payoff of each agent is at least −t and at most 
proposition it is a subgame perfect equilibrium of the 
elicitation mechanism to report the true load and to 
challenge with the true load only if the other agent overreports 
proof assume w l o g that the elicitation of alice s load 
is done after bob s and that stage is reached if alice 
truly reports la lt 
a bob strictly prefers to agree 
otherwise if bob challenges alice would always strictly prefer 
to transfer as in this case bob would perform her load for 
smaller cost as a result bob would pay t to the 
mechanism this punishing outcome is less preferable than the 
normal outcome of stage achieved had he agreed 
if alice misreports la lt 
a then bob can ensure himself 
the bonus which is always strictly preferable than reaching 
stage by challenging with la lt 
a and so whenever 
bob gets the bonus alice gains the worst of all payoffs 
reporting a lower load la lt 
a is not beneficial for alice 
in this case bob would strictly prefer to agree and not to 
announce la la as he limited to challenge with a smaller 
load than what she announces thus such misreporting can 
only increase the possibility that she is assigned the task 
and so there is no incentive for alice to do so 
all together alice would prefer to report the truth in this 
stage and so stage would not abnormally end by stop 
and similarly stage 
observe that the elicitation mechanism is almost balanced 
in all outcomes no money comes in or out except for the 
non-equilibrium outcome a in which both players pay to 
the mechanism 
 
in if an agent misreport his type then it is always 
beneficial to the other agent to challenge in particular 
even if the agent reports a lower load 
 elicitation mechanism for partially informed 
agents 
in this subsection we consider partially informed agents 
formally 
definition an agent a is p-informed about agent b 
if a knows the type of b with probability p independently 
of what b knows 
it turns out that a version of the elicitation mechanism 
works for this relaxed information assumption if we use the 
concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated 
strategies 
 we replace the fixed fine of in the elicitation 
mechanism with the fine 
βp max l 
 − p 
 p − 
t 
and assume the bounds lt 
a lt 
b ≤ l 
proposition if all agents are p-informed p 
the elicitation mechanism βp implements the fair 
assignment goal with the concept of iterative elimination of weakly 
dominated strategies the strategy of each player is to report 
the true load and to challenge with the true load if the other 
agent overreport 
proof assume w l o g that the elicitation of alice s load 
is done after bob s and that stage is reached first 
observe that underreporting the true value is a dominated 
strategy whether bob is not informed and mistakenly 
challenges with a lower load as βp ≥ l or not or even 
if t is very small now we shall see that overreporting her 
value is a dominated strategy as well 
alice s expected payoff gained by misreporting ≤ 
p payoff if she lies and bob is informed − p max 
payoff if bob is not informed ≤ 
p −t − βp p −t − p −t − βp ≤ 
p min payoff of true report if bob is informed − p 
 min payoff if bob is not informed ≤ 
alice s expected payoff if she truly reports 
the term −t−βp in the left hand side is due to the fact 
that if bob is informed he will always prefer to challenge 
in the right hand side if he is informed then challenging is 
a dominated strategy and if he is not informed the worst 
harm he can make is to challenge thus in stage alice will 
report her true load this implies that challenging without 
being informed is a dominated strategy for bob 
this argument can be reasoned also for the first stage 
when bob reports his value bob knows the maximum payoff 
he can gain is at most zero since he cannot expect to get the 
bonus in the next stage 
 extensions 
the elicitation mechanism for partially informed agents is 
rather general as in we need the capability to judge 
between two distinct declarations in the elicitation rounds 
 
a strategy si of player i is weakly dominated if there exists 
si such that i the payoff gained by si is at least as high as 
the payoff gained by si for all strategies of the other players 
and all preferences and ii there exist a preference and a 
combination of strategies for the other players such that the 
payoff gained by si is strictly higher than the payoff gained 
by si 
 
and upper and lower bounds based on the possible payoffs 
derived from the last stage in addition for p-informed 
environments some structure is needed to ensure that 
underbidding is a dominated strategy 
the choregia-type mechanisms can be applied to more 
than players with the same number of stages the player in 
the first stage can simply points out the name of the 
wealthiest agent similarly the elicitation mechanisms can be 
extended in a straightforward manner these mechanisms can 
be budget-balanced as some player might replace the role 
of the designer and collect the fines as observed in 
open problem design a decentralized budget balanced 
mechanism with reasonable fines for independently p-informed 
n players where p ≤ − 
 
n− 
 seller and buyer scenario 
a player might cause severe harm to others by choosing a 
non-equilibrium outcome in the mechanism for the fair 
assignment goal an agent might maliciously challenge even 
if the other agent truly reports his load in this subsection 
we consider such malicious scenarios for the ease of 
exposition we present a second example we demonstrate that 
equilibria remain unchanged even if players are malicious 
in the seller-buyer example there is one item to be traded 
and two possible future states the goal is to sell the item for 
the average low price pl ls lb 
 
in state l and the higher 
price ph hs hb 
 
in the other state h where ls is seller s 
cost and lb is buyer s value in state l and similarly hs hb in 
h the players fix the prices without knowing what will be 
the future state assume that ls hs lb hb and that 
trade can occur in both prices that is pl ph ∈ hs lb 
only the players can observe the realization of the true 
state the payoffs are of the form ub xv−tb us ts −xvs 
where the binary variable x indicates if trade occurred and 
tb ts are the transfers consider the following decentralized 
trade mechanism 
 stage if seller reports h goto stage otherwise 
trade at the low price pl stop 
 stage the buyer has to choose between 
- a trade at the high price ph 
- b no trade and seller pays ∆ to the buyer 
claim let ∆ lb−ph the unique subgame perfect 
equilibrium of the trade mechanism is to report the true state 
in stage and trading if stage is reached 
note that the outcome b is never chosen in equilibrium 
 trade mechanism for malicious agents 
the buyer might maliciously punish the seller by 
choosing the outcome b when the true state is h the following 
notion quantifies the consideration that a player is not 
indifferent to the private surpluses of others 
definition a player is q-malicious if his payoff equals 
 − q his private surplus − q summation of others 
surpluses q ∈ 
this definition appeared independently in in different 
context we shall see that the traders would avoid such bad 
behavior if they are q-malicious where q that is if 
their non-indifference impact is bounded by 
equilibria outcomes remain unchanged and so cooperation is 
achieved as in the original case of non-malicious players 
consider the trade mechanism with pl − q hs q lb 
ph q hs − q lb ∆ − q hb − lb − note that 
pl ph for q 
claim if q then the unique subgame perfect 
equilibrium for q-malicious players remains unchanged 
proof by backward induction we consider two cases 
in state h the q-malicious buyer would prefer to trade if 
 − q hb − ph q hs − ph − q ∆ q ∆ indeed 
 − q hb qhs ∆ ph trivially the seller prefers to 
trade at the higher price − q pl − hs q pl − hb 
 − q ph − hs q ph − hb 
in state l the buyer prefers the no trade outcome as 
 −q lb −ph q ls −ph ∆ the seller prefers to trade 
at a low price as − q pl − ls q pl − lb −∆ 
 discussion 
no mechanism can nash-implement this trading goal if 
the only possible outcomes are trade at pl and trade at ph 
to see this it is enough to consider normal forms as any 
extensive form mechanism can be presented as a normal one 
consider a matrix representation where the seller is the row 
player and the buyer is the column player in which every 
entry includes an outcome suppose there is equilibrium entry 
for the state l the associate column must be all pl 
otherwise the seller would have an incentive to deviate similarly 
the associate row of the h equilibrium entry must be all ph 
 otherwise the buyer would deviate a contradiction 
the buyer prefers pl and seller ph and so the preferences 
are identical in both states hence reporting preferences 
over outcomes is not enough - players must supply 
additional information this is captured by outcome b in 
the trade mechanism 
intuitively if a goal is not nash-implementable we need 
to add more outcomes the drawback is that some new 
additional equilibria must be ruled out e g additional 
nash equilibrium for the trade mechanism is trade at pl 
 b that is the seller chooses to trade at low price at either 
states and the buyer always chooses the no trade option that 
fines the seller if the second stage is reached such buyer s 
threat is not credible because if the mechanism is played 
only once and stage is reached in state h the buyer would 
strictly decrease his payoff if he chooses b clearly this is 
not a subgame perfect equilibrium although each extensive 
game-form is strategically equivalent to a normal form one 
the extensive form representation places more structure and 
so it seems plausible that the subgame perfect equilibrium 
will be played 
 
formally this goal is not maskin monotonic a necessary 
condition for nash-implementability 
 
a similar argument applies for the fair assignment 
problem 
 
interestingly it is a straight forward to construct a 
sequential mechanism with unique spe and additional ne with a 
strictly larger payoff for every player 
 
 peer-to-peer networks 
in this section we describe a simplified peer-to-peer 
network for file sharing without payments in equilibrium using 
a certificate-based challenging method in this challenging 
method - as opposed to - an agent that challenges cannot 
harm other agents unless he provides a valid certificate 
in general if agent b copied a file f from agent a then 
agent a knows that agent b holds a copy of the file we 
denote such information as a certificate b f we shall omit 
cryptographic details such a certificate can be recorded 
and distributed along the network and so we can treat each 
agent holding the certificate as an informed agent 
assumptions we assume an homogeneous system with 
files of equal size the benefit each agent gains by holding 
a copy of any file is v the only cost each agent has is 
the uploading cost c induced while transferring a file to 
an immediate neighbor all other costs are negligible e g 
storing the certificates forwarding messages providing 
acknowledgements digital signatures etc let upa downa 
be the numbers of agent a uploads and downloads if he 
always cooperates we assume that each agent a enters the 
system if upa · c downa · v 
each agent has a quasilinear utility and only cares about 
his current bandwidth usage in particular he ignores future 
scenarios e g whether forwarding or dropping of a packet 
might affect future demand 
 basic mechanism 
we start with a mechanism for a network with p-informed 
agents b a a we assume that b is directly connected 
to a and a 
if b has the certificate a f then he can apply directly 
to a and request the file if he refuses then b can go to 
court the following basic sequential mechanism is 
applicable whenever agent b is not informed and still would like to 
download the file if it exists in the network note that this 
goal cannot be implemented in dominant strategies 
without payments similar to claim when the type of each 
agent here is the set of files he holds define ta b to be the 
monetary amount that agent a should transfer to b 
 stage agent b requests the file f from a 
- if a replies yes then b downloads the file from 
a stop 
- otherwise agent b sends a s no reply to agent 
a 
 if a declares agree then goto the next stage 
 else a sends a certificate a f to agent b 
· if the certificate is correct then ta a 
βp stop 
· else ta a c stop 
stage agent b requests the file f from a switch 
the roles of the agents a a 
claim the basic mechanism is budget-balanced 
 transfers always sum to zero and decentralized 
theorem let βp c 
p 
 p ∈ a strategy that 
survives iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies 
is to reply yes if ai holds the file and to challenge only 
with a valid certificate as a result b downloads the file if 
some agent holds it in equilibrium there are no payments 
or transfers in equilibrium 
proof clearly if the mechanism ends without 
challenging −c ≤ u ai ≤ and so challenging with an invalid 
certificate is always a dominated strategy now when stage 
 is reached a is the last to report if he has the file if a 
has the file it is a weakly undominated strategy to misreport 
whether a is informed or not 
a s expected payoff gained by misreporting no ≤ 
p · −βp − p · −c ≤ a s payoff if she reports 
yes 
this argument can be reasoned also for stage when 
a reports whether he has the file a knows that a will 
report yes if and only if she has the file in the next stage 
and so the maximum payoff he can gain is at most zero since 
he cannot expect to get a bonus 
 chain networks 
in a chain network agent b is directly connected to a 
and ai is directly connected to agent ai assume that we 
have an acknowledgment protocol to confirm the receipt of 
a particular message to avoid message dropping we add 
the fine βp to be paid by an agent who hasn t properly 
forwarded a message the chain mechanism follows 
 stage i agent b forwards a request for the file f to 
ai through ak k≤i 
 if ai reports yes then b downloads f from ai 
stop 
 otherwise ai reports no 
if aj sends a certificate ak f to b j k ≤ i then 
- if certificate ak f is correct then t ak aj 
βp stop 
- else t aj ak c stop 
if ai reports that he has no copy of the file then any agent 
in between might challenge using digital signatures and 
acknowledgements observe that every agent must forward 
each message even if it contains a certificate showing that 
he himself has misreported 
we use the same fine βp as in the basic mechanism 
because the protocol might end at stage clearly the former 
analysis still applies since the actual p increases with the 
number of players 
 network mechanism 
in this subsection we consider general network structures 
we need the assumption that there is a ping protocol that 
checks whether a neighbor agent is on-line or not that is 
an on-line agent cannot hide himself to limit the amount 
of information to be recorded we assume that an agent is 
committed to keep any downloaded file to at least one hour 
and so certificates are valid for a limited amount of time we 
assume that each agent has a digitally signed listing of his 
current immediate neighbors as in real p p file sharing 
applications we restrict each request for a file to be forwarded 
at most r times that is downloads are possible only inside 
a neighborhood of radius r 
 
the network mechanism utilizes the chain mechanism in 
the following way when agent b requests a file from agent 
a at most r − far then a sends to b the list of his 
neighbors and the output of the ping protocol to all of these 
neighbors as a result b can explore the network 
remark in this mechanism we assumed that the 
environment is p-informed an important design issue that it 
is not addressed here is the incentives for the information 
propagation phase 
 web cache 
web caches are widely used tool to improve overall 
system efficiency by allowing fast local access they were listed 
in as a challenging application of distributed 
algorithmic mechanism design 
nisan considered a single cache shared by strategic 
agents in this problem agent i gains the value vt 
i if a 
particular item is loaded to the local shared cache the 
efficient goal is to load the item if and only if σvt 
i ≥ c 
where c is the loading cost this goal reduces to the public 
project problem analyzed by clarke however it is well 
known that this mechanism is not budget-balanced e g if 
the valuation of each player is c then everyone pays zero 
in this section we suggest informational and 
environmental assumptions for which we describe a decentralized 
budgetbalanced efficient mechanism we consider environments 
for which future demand of each agent depends on past 
demand the underlying informational and environmental 
requirements are as follows 
 an agent can read the content of a message only if he 
is the target node even if he has to forward the 
message as an intermediate node of some routing path 
an agent cannot initiate a message on behalf of other 
agents 
 an acknowledgement protocol is available so that 
every agent can provide a certificate indicating that he 
handled a certain message properly 
 negligible costs we assume p-informed agents where 
p is such that the agent s induced cost for keeping 
records of information is negligible we also assume 
that the cost incurred by sending and forwarding 
messages is negligible 
 let qi t denotes the number of loading requests agent 
i initiated for the item during the time slot t we 
assume that vt 
i t the value for caching the item in 
the beginning of slot t depends only on most recent 
slot formally vt 
i t max vi qi t − c where 
vi · is a non-decreasing real function in addition 
vi · is a common knowledge among the players 
 the network is homogeneous in the sense that if 
agent j happens to handle k requests initiated by agent 
i during the time slot t then qi t kα where α 
depends on the routing protocol and the environment 
 α might be smaller than if each request is flooded 
several times we assume that the only way agent i 
can affect the true qi t is by superficially increasing 
his demand for the cached item but not the other way 
 that is agent s loss incurred by giving up a necessary 
request for the item is not negligible 
the first requirement is to avoid free riding and also to 
avoid the case that an agent superficially increases the 
demand of others and as a result decreases his own demand 
the second requirement is to avoid the case that an agent 
who gets a routing request for the item records it and then 
drops it the third is to ensure that the environment stays 
well informed in addition if the forwarding cost is 
negligible each agent cooperates and forwards messages as he would 
not like to decrease the future demand that monotonically 
depends on the current time slot as assumed in the forth 
requirement of some other agent given that the payments 
are increasing with the declared values the forth and fifth 
requirements ensure that the agent would not increase his 
demand superficially and so qi t is the true demand 
the following web-cache mechanism implements the 
efficient goal that shares the cost proportionally for simplicity 
it is described for two players and w l o g vt 
i t equals the 
number of requests initiated by i and observed by any 
informed j that is α and vi qi t − qi t −

 a strategy that survives iterative elimination of weakly 
dominated strategies is to report the truth and to challenge 
only when the agent is informed the mechanism is efficient 
budget-balanced exhibits consumer sovereignty no positive 
transfer and individual rationality 
 
proof challenging without being informed that is 
without providing enough valid records is always dominated 
strategy in this mechanism now assume w l o g alice is

the last to report her value alice s expected payoff gained 
by underreporting ≤ 
p · −c − βp − p · c p · − p · ≤ alice s 
expected payoff if she honestly reports 
the right hand side equals zero as the participation costs 
are negligible reasoning back bob cannot expect to get 
the bonus and so misreporting is dominated strategy for 
him 
 concluding remarks 
in this paper we have seen a new partial informational 
assumption and we have demonstrated its suitability to 
networks in which computational agents can easily collect 
and distribute information we then described some 
mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly 
dominated strategies some issues for future work include 
 as we have seen the implementation issue in p-informed 
environments is straightforward - it is easy to construct 
incentive compatible mechanisms even for 
non-singleparameter cases the challenge is to find more realistic 
scenarios in which the partial informational 
assumption is applicable 
 mechanisms for information propagation and 
maintenance in our examples we choose p such that the 
maintenance cost over time is negligible however 
the dynamics of the general case is delicate an agent 
can use the recorded information to eliminate data 
that is not likely to be needed in order to decrease 
his maintenance costs as a result the probability 
that the environment is informed decreases and 
selfish agents would not cooperate incentives for 
information propagation should be considered as well e g 
for p p networks for file sharing 
 it seems that some social choice goals cannot be 
implemented if each player is at least n-malicious where 
n is the number of players it would be interesting to 
identify these cases
