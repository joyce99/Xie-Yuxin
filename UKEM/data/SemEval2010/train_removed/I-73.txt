abstract 
in open mas it is often a problem to achieve agents 
interoperability the heterogeneity of its components turns the 
establishment of interaction or cooperation among them into a 
non trivial task since agents may use different internal models 
and the decision about trust other agents is a crucial condition to 
the formation of agents cooperation in this paper we propose the 
use of an ontology to deal with this issue we experiment this idea 
by enhancing the art reputation model with semantic data 
obtained from this ontology this data is used during interaction 
among heterogeneous agents when exchanging reputation values 
and may be used for agents that use different reputation models 
categories and subject descriptors

 introduction 
open multiagent systems mas are composed of autonomous 
distributed agents that may enter and leave the agent society at 
their will because open systems have no centralized control over 
the development of its parts since agents are considered as 
autonomous entities we cannot assume that there is a way to 
control their internal behavior these features are interesting to 
obtain flexible and adaptive systems but they also create new risks 
about the reliability and the robustness of the system solutions to 
this problem have been proposed by the way of trust models 
where agents are endowed with a model of other agents that 
allows them to decide if they can or cannot trust another agent 
such trust decision is very important because it is an essential 
condition to the formation of agents cooperation the trust 
decision processes use the concept of reputation as the basis of a 
decision reputation is a subject that has been studied in several 
works with different approaches but also with 
different semantics attached to the reputation concept casare and 
sichman proposed a functional ontology of reputation 
 fore and some directions about how it could be used to allow 
the interoperability among different agent reputation models this 
paper describes how the fore can be applied to allow 
interoperability among agents that have different reputation 
models an outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a 
testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models 
the art testbed 
 the functional ontology of 
reputation fore 
in the last years several computational models of reputation have 
been proposed as an example of research 
produced in the mas field we refer to three of them a cognitive 
reputation model a typology of reputation and the 
reputation model used in the regret system each model 
includes its own specific concepts that may not exist in other 
models or exist with a different name for instance image and 
reputation are two central concepts in the cognitive reputation 
model these concepts do not exist in the typology of reputation 
or in the regret model in the typology of reputation we can find 
some similar concepts such as direct reputation and indirect 
reputation but there are some slight semantic differences in the 
same way the regret model includes four kinds of reputation 
 direct witness neighborhood and system that overlap with the 
concepts of other models but that are not exactly the same 
the functional ontology of reputation fore was defined as a 
common semantic basis that subsumes the concepts of the main 
reputation models the fore includes as its kernel the following 
concepts reputation nature roles involved in reputation formation 
and propagation information sources for reputation evaluation of 
reputation and reputation maintenance the ontology concept 
reputationnature is composed of concepts such as 
individualreputation groupreputation and productreputation 
reputation formation and propagation involves several roles 
played by the entities or agents that participate in those processes 
the ontology defines the concepts reputationprocess and 
reputationrole moreover reputation can be classified according 
to the origin of beliefs and opinions that can derive from several 
sources the ontology defines the concept reputationtype which 
can be primaryreputation or secondaryreputation 
primaryreputation is composed of concepts observedreputation 
and directreputation and the concept secondaryreputation is 
composed of concepts such as propagatedreputation and 
collectivereputation more details about the fore can be found 
on 
 mapping the agent reputation 
models to the fore 
visser et al suggest three different ways to support semantic 
integration of different sources of information a centralized 
approach where each source of information is related to one 
common domain ontology a decentralized approach where every 
source of information is related to its own ontology and a hybrid 
approach where every source of information has its own ontology 
and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common 
ontology this latter organizes the common global vocabulary in 
order to support the source ontologies comparison casare and 
sichman used the hybrid approach to show that the fore 
serves as a common ontology for several reputation models 
therefore considering the ontologies which describe the agent 
reputation models we can define a mapping between these 
ontologies and the fore whenever the ontologies use a common 
vocabulary also the information concerning the mappings 
between the agent reputation models and the fore can be directly 
inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the 
integration of a given reputation model ontology and the fore in 
an ontology tool with reasoning engine 
for instance a mapping between the cognitive reputation model 
ontology and the fore relates the concepts image and reputation 
to primaryreputation and secondaryreputation from fore 
respectively also a mapping between the typology of 
reputation and the fore relates the concepts direct reputation 
and indirect reputation to primaryreputation and 
secondaryreputation from fore respectively nevertheless the 
concepts direct trust and witness reputation from the regret 
system reputation model are mapped to primaryreputation and 
propagatedreputation from fore since propagatedreputation is 
a sub-concept of secondaryreputation it can be inferred that 
witness reputation is also mapped to secondaryreputation 
 experimental scenarios using 
the art testbed 
to exemplify the use of mappings from last section we define a 
scenario where several agents are implemented using different 
agent reputation models this scenario includes the agents 
interaction during the simulation of the game defined by art 
in order to describe the ways interoperability is possible between 
different trust models using the fore 
 the art testbed 
the art testbed provides a simulation engine on which several 
agents using different trust models may run the simulation 
consists in a game where the agents have to decide to trust or not 
other agents the game s domain is art appraisal in which agents 
are required to evaluate the value of paintings based on 
information exchanged among other agents during agents 
interaction the information can be an opinion transaction when 
an agent asks other agents to help it in its evaluation of a painting 
or a reputation transaction when the information required is 
about the reputation of another agent a target for a given era 
more details about the art testbed can be found in 
the art common reputation model was enhanced with semantic 
data obtained from fore a general agent architecture for 
interoperability was defined to allow agents to reason about 
the information received from reputation interactions this 
architecture contains two main modules the reputation mapping 
module rmm which is responsible for mapping concepts 
between an agent reputation model and fore and the reputation 
reasoning module rrm which is responsible for deal with 
information about reputation according to the agent reputation 
model 
 reputation transaction scenarios 
while including the fore to the art common reputation model 
we have incremented it to allow richer interactions that involve 
reputation transaction in this section we describe scenarios 
concerning reputation transactions in the context of art testbed 
but the first is valid for any kind of reputation transaction and the 
second is specific for the art domain 
 general scenario 
suppose that agents a b and c are implemented according to the 
aforementioned general agent architecture with the enhanced art 
common reputation model using different reputation models 
agent a uses the typology of reputation model agent b uses the 
cognitive reputation model and agent c uses the regret system 
model consider the interaction about reputation where agents a 
and b receive from agent c information about the reputation of 
agent y a big picture of this interaction is showed in figure

figure interaction about reputation 
the information witness reputation from agent c is treated by its 
rmm and is sent as propagatedreputation to both agents the 
corresponding information in agent a reputation model is 
propagated reputation and in agent b reputation model is 
reputation the way agents a and b make use of the information 
depends on their internal reputation model and their rrm 
implementation

 art scenario 
considering the same agents a and b and the art appraisal domain 
of art another interesting scenario describes the following 
situation agent a asks to agent b information about agents it 
knows that have skill on some specific painting era in this case 
agent a wants information concerning the direct reputation agent 
b has about agents that have skill on an specific era such as 
cubism following the same steps of the previous scenario agent 
a message is prepared in its rrm using information from its 
internal model a big picture of this interaction is in figure

agent b response to agent a is processed in its rrm and it is

the pair agent value is composed of all agents and associated 
reputation values whose agent b knows their expertise about 
cubism by its own opinion this response is forwarded to the 
rmm in order to be translated to the enriched common model and 
to be sent to agent a after receiving the information sent by 
agent b agent a processes it in its rmm and translates it to its 
own reputation model to be analyzed by its rrm 
 conclusion 
in this paper we present a proposal for reducing the 
incompatibility between reputation models by using a general 
agent architecture for reputation interaction which relies on a 
functional ontology of reputation fore used as a globally 
shared reputation model a reputation mapping module allows 
agents to translate information from their internal reputation 
model into the shared model and vice versa the art testbed has 
been enriched to use the ontology during agent transactions some 
scenarios were described to illustrate our proposal and they seem 
to be a promising way to improve the process of building 
reputation just using existing technologies
