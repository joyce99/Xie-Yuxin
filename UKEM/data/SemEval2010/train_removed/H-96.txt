abstract 
implicit relevance feedback irf is the process by which a search 
system unobtrusively gathers evidence on searcher interests from their 
interaction with the system irf is a new method of gathering 
information on user interest and if irf is to be used in operational ir 
systems it is important to establish when it performs well and when it 
performs poorly in this paper we investigate how the use and 
effectiveness of irf is affected by three factors search task 
complexity the search experience of the user and the stage in the 
search our findings suggest that all three of these factors contribute 
to the utility of irf

 introduction 
information retrieval ir systems are designed to help searchers 
solve problems in the traditional interaction metaphor employed by 
web search systems such as yahoo and msn search the system 
generally only supports the retrieval of potentially relevant documents 
from the collection however it is also possible to offer support to 
searchers for different search activities such as selecting the terms to 
present to the system or choosing which search strategy to adopt 
 both of which can be problematic for searchers 
as the quality of the query submitted to the system directly affects the 
quality of search results the issue of how to improve search queries 
has been studied extensively in ir research techniques such as 
relevance feedback rf have been proposed as a way in which 
the ir system can support the iterative development of a search query 
by suggesting alternative terms for query modification however in 
practice rf techniques have been underutilised as they place an 
increased cognitive burden on searchers to directly indicate relevant 
results 
implicit relevance feedback irf has been proposed as a way in 
which search queries can be improved by passively observing 
searchers as they interact irf has been implemented either through 
the use of surrogate measures based on interaction with documents 
 such as reading time scrolling or document retention or using 
interaction with browse-based result interfaces irf has been 
shown to display mixed effectiveness because the factors that are good 
indicators of user interest are often erratic and the inferences drawn 
from user interaction are not always valid 
in this paper we present a study into the use and effectiveness of irf 
in an online search environment the study aims to investigate the 
factors that affect irf in particular three research questions i is the 
use of and perceived quality of terms generated by irf affected by the 
search task ii is the use of and perceived quality of terms generated 
by irf affected by the level of search experience of system users iii 
is irf equally used and does it generate terms that are equally useful 
at all search stages this study aims to establish when and under what 
circumstances irf performs well in terms of its use and the query 
modification terms selected as a result of its use 
the main experiment from which the data are taken was designed to 
test techniques for selecting query modification terms and techniques 
for displaying retrieval results in this paper we use data derived 
from that experiment to study factors affecting the utility of irf 
 study 
in this section we describe the user study conducted to address our 
research questions 
 systems 
our study used two systems both of which suggested new query terms 
to the user one system suggested terms based on the user s 
interaction irf the other used explicit rf erf asking the user to 
explicitly indicate relevant material both systems used the same term 
suggestion algorithm and used a common interface 
 interface overview 
in both systems retrieved documents are represented at the interface 
by their full-text and a variety of smaller query-relevant 
representations created at retrieval time we used the web as the test 
collection in this study and google 
as the underlying search engine 
document representations include the document title and a summary 
of the document a list of top-ranking sentences trs extracted from 
the top documents retrieved scored in relation to the query a sentence 
in the document summary and each summary sentence in the context 
it occurs in the document i e with the preceding and following 
sentence each summary sentence and top-ranking sentence is 
regarded as a representation of the document the default display 
contains the list of top-ranking sentences and the list of the first ten 
document titles interacting with a representation guides searchers to a 
different representation from the same document e g moving the 
mouse over a document title displays a summary of the document 
this presentation of progressively more information from documents 
to aid relevance assessments has been shown to be effective in earlier 
work in appendix a we show the complete interface to the 
irf system with the document representations marked and in 
appendix b we show a fragment from the erf interface with the 
checkboxes used by searchers to indicate relevant information both 
systems provide an interactive query expansion feature by suggesting 
new query terms to the user the searcher has the responsibility for 
choosing which if any of these terms to add to the query the 
searcher can also add or remove terms from the query at will 
 explicit rf system 
this version of the system implements explicit rf next to each 
document representation are checkboxes that allow searchers to mark 
individual representations as relevant marking a representation is an 
indication that its contents are relevant only the representations 
marked relevant by the user are used for suggesting new query terms 
this system was used as a baseline against which the irf system 
could be compared 
 implicit rf system 
this system makes inferences about searcher interests based on the 
information with which they interact as described in section 
interacting with a representation highlights a new representation from 
the same document to the searcher this is a way they can find out 
more information from a potentially interesting source to the implicit 
rf system each interaction with a representation is interpreted as an 
implicit indication of interest in that representation interacting with a 
representation is assumed to be an indication that its contents are 
relevant the query modification terms are selected using the same 
algorithm as in the explicit rf system therefore the only difference 
between the systems is how relevance is communicated to the system 
the results of the main experiment indicated that these two 
systems were comparable in terms of effectiveness 
 tasks 
search tasks were designed to encourage realistic search behaviour by 
our subjects the tasks were phrased in the form of simulated work 
task situations i e short search scenarios that were designed to 
reflect real-life search situations and allow subjects to develop 
personal assessments of relevance we devised six search topics i e 
applying to university allergies in the workplace art galleries in 
rome third generation mobile phones internet music piracy and 
petrol prices based on pilot testing with a small representative group 
of subjects these subjects were not involved in the main experiment 
for each topic three versions of each work task situation were 
devised each version differing in their predicted level of task 
complexity as described in task complexity is a variable that 
affects subject perceptions of a task and their interactive behaviour 
e g subjects perform more filtering activities with highly complex 
search tasks by developing tasks of different complexity we can 
assess how the nature of the task affects the subjects interactive 
behaviour and hence the evidence supplied to irf algorithms task 
complexity was varied according to the methodology described in 
specifically by varying the number of potential information sources 
and types of information required to complete a task in our pilot 
tests and in a posteriori analysis of the main experiment results we 
verified that subjects reporting of individual task complexity matched 
our estimation of the complexity of the task 
subjects attempted three search tasks one high complexity one 
moderate complexity and one low complexity 
 they were asked to 
read the task place themselves in the situation it described and find 
the information they felt was required to complete the task figure 
shows the task statements for three levels of task complexity for one 
of the six search topics 
hc task high complexity 
whilst having dinner with an american colleague they comment on the 
high price of petrol in the uk compared to other countries despite large 
volumes coming from the same source unaware of any major differences 
you decide to find out how and why petrol prices vary worldwide 
mc task moderate complexity 
whilst out for dinner one night one of your friends guests is complaining 
about the price of petrol and the factors that cause it throughout the night 
they seem to be complaining about everything they can reducing the 
credibility of their earlier statements so you decide to research which 
factors actually are important in determining the price of petrol in the uk 
lc task low complexity 
while out for dinner one night your friend complains about the rising 
price of petrol however as you have not been driving for long you are 
unaware of any major changes in price you decide to find out how the 
price of petrol has changed in the uk in recent years

 subjects 
 volunteers expressed an interest in participating in our study 
subjects were selected from this set with the aim of populating two 
groups each with subjects inexperienced infrequent 
inexperienced searchers and experienced frequent experienced 
searchers subjects were not chosen and classified into their groups 
until they had completed an entry questionnaire that asked them about 
their search experience and computer use 
the average age of the subjects was years maximum 
minimum σ years and had a university diploma or a 
higher degree of subjects had or were pursuing a 
qualification in a discipline related to computer science the subjects 
were a mixture of students researchers academic staff and others 
with different levels of computer and search experience the subjects 
were divided into the two groups depending on their search 
experience how often they searched and the types of searches they 
performed all were familiar with web searching and some with 
searching in other domains 
 methodology 
the experiment had a factorial design with levels of search 
experience experimental systems although we only report on the 
findings from the erf and irf systems and levels of search task 
complexity subjects attempted one task of each complexity 
 
the main experiment from which these results are drawn had a third 
comparator system which had a different interface each subject 
carried out three tasks one on each system we only report on the 
results from the erf and irf systems as these are the only pertinent 
ones for this paper 
switched systems after each task and used each system once the 
order in which systems were used and search tasks attempted was 
randomised according to a latin square experimental design 
questionnaires used likert scales semantic differentials and 
openended questions to elicit subject opinions system logging was 
also used to record subject interaction 
a tutorial carried out prior to the experiment allowed subjects to use a 
non-feedback version of the system to attempt a practice task before 
using the first experimental system experiments lasted between 
oneand-a-half and two hours dependent on variables such as the time 
spent completing questionnaires subjects were offered a minute 
break after the first hour in each experiment 
i the subject was welcomed and asked to read an introduction to 
the experiments and sign consent forms this set of instructions 
was written to ensure that each subject received precisely the 
same information 
ii the subject was asked to complete an introductory questionnaire 
this contained questions about the subject s education general 
search experience computer experience and web search 
experience 
iii the subject was given a tutorial on the interface followed by a 
training topic on a version of the interface with no rf 
iv the subject was given three task sheets and asked to choose one 
task from the six topics on each sheet no guidelines were given 
to subjects when choosing a task other than they could not 
choose a task from any topic more than once task complexity 
was rotated by the experimenter so each subject attempted one 
high complexity task one moderate complexity task and one low 
complexity task 
v the subject was asked to perform the search and was given 
minutes to search the subject could terminate a search early if 
they were unable to find any more information they felt helped 
them complete the task 
vi after completion of the search the subject was asked to complete 
a post-search questionnaire 
vii the remaining tasks were attempted by the subject following 
steps v and vi 
viii the subject completed a post-experiment questionnaire and 
participated in a post-experiment interview 
subjects were told that their interaction may be used by the irf 
system to help them as they searched they were not told which 
behaviours would be used or how it would be used 
we now describe the findings of our analysis 
 findings 
in this section we use the data derived from the experiment to answer 
our research questions about the effect of search task complexity 
search experience and stage in search on the use and effectiveness of 
irf we present our findings per research question due to the 
ordinal nature of much of the data non-parametric statistical testing is 
used in this analysis and the level of significance is set to p 
unless otherwise stated we use the method proposed by to 
determine the significance of differences in multiple comparisons and 
that of to test for interaction effects between experimental 
variables the occurrence of which we report where appropriate all 
likert scales and semantic differentials were on a -point scale where 
a rating closer to signifies more agreement with the attitude 
statement the category labels hc mc and lc are used to denote the 
high moderate and low complexity tasks respectively the highest or 
most positive values in each table are shown in bold our analysis 
uses data from questionnaires post-experiment interviews and 
background system logging on the erf and irf systems 
 search task 
searchers attempted three search tasks of varying complexity each on 
a different experimental system in this section we present an analysis 
on the use and usefulness of irf for search tasks of different 
complexities we present our findings in terms of the rf provided by 
subjects and the terms recommended by the systems 
 feedback 
we use questionnaires and system logs to gather data on subject 
perceptions and provision of rf for different search tasks in the 
postsearch questionnaire subjects were asked about how rf was conveyed 
using differentials to elicit their opinion on 
 the value of the feedback technique how you conveyed relevance 
to the system i e ticking boxes or viewing information was easy 
difficult effective ineffective useful not useful 
 the process of providing the feedback how you conveyed relevance 
to the system made you feel comfortable uncomfortable in 
control not in control 
the average obtained differential values are shown in table for irf 
and each task category the value corresponding to the differential 
all represents the mean of all differentials for a particular attitude 
statement this gives some overall understanding of the subjects 
feelings which can be useful as the subjects may not answer individual 
differentials very precisely the values for erf are included for 
reference in this table and all other tables and figures in the findings 
section since the aim of the paper is to investigate situations in which 
irf might perform well not a direct comparison between irf and 
erf we make only limited comparisons between these two types of 
feedback 
table subject perceptions of rf method lower better 
each cell in table summarises the subject responses for 
tasksystem pairs subjects who ran a high complexity hc task on the 
erf system subjects who ran a medium complexity mc task on 
the erf system etc kruskal-wallis tests were applied to each 
differential for each type of rf 
 subject responses suggested that 
 
since this analysis involved many differentials we use a bonferroni 
correction to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha 
level α to and for both statements and 
respectively i e divided by the number of differentials this 
correction reduces the number of type i errors i e rejecting null

irf was most effective and useful for more complex search tasks 
and that the differences in all pair-wise comparisons between tasks 
were significant 
 subject perceptions of irf elicited using the other 
differentials did not appear to be affected by the complexity of the 
search task 
 to determine whether a relationship exists between the 
effectiveness and usefulness of the irf process and task complexity 
we applied spearman s rank order correlation coefficient to 
participant responses the results of this analysis suggest that the 
effectiveness of irf and usefulness of irf are both related to task 
complexity as task complexity increases subject preference for irf 
also increases 
 
on the other hand subjects felt erf was more effective and useful 
for low complexity tasks 
 their verbal reporting of erf where 
perceived utility and effectiveness increased as task complexity 
decreased supports this finding in tasks of lower complexity the 
subjects felt they were better able to provide feedback on whether or 
not documents were relevant to the task 
we analyse interaction logs generated by both interfaces to investigate 
the amount of rf subjects provided to do this we use a measure of 
search precision that is the proportion of all possible document 
representations that a searcher assessed divided by the total number 
they could assess in erf this is the proportion of all possible 
representations that were marked relevant by the searcher i e those 
representations explicitly marked relevant in irf this is the 
proportion of representations viewed by a searcher over all possible 
representations that could have been viewed by the searcher this 
proportion measures the searcher s level of interaction with a 
document we take it to measure the user s interest in the document 
the more document representations viewed the more interested we 
assume a user is in the content of the document 
there are a maximum of representations per document 
topranking sentences title summary summary sentences and 
summary sentences in document context since the interface shows 
document representations from the top- documents there are

for irf there is a clear pattern as complexity increases the subjects

feedback varies based on the complexity of the search task since irf 
is based on the interaction of the searcher the more they interact the 
more feedback they provide this has no effect on the number of rf 
terms chosen but may affect the quality of the terms selected 
correlation analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between the 
number of documents viewed and the amount of feedback searchers 
provide 
 as the number of documents viewed increases the proportion 
of feedback falls searchers view less representations of each 
document this may be a natural consequence of their being less 
time to view documents in a time constrained task environment but as 
we will show as complexity changes the nature of information 
searchers interact with also appears to change in the next section we 
investigate the effect of task complexity on the terms chosen as a 
result of irf 
 terms 
the same rf algorithm was used to select query modification terms in 
all systems we use subject opinions of terms recommended by 
the systems as a measure of the effectiveness of irf with respect to 
the terms generated for different search tasks to test this subjects 
were asked to complete two semantic differentials that completed the

kruskal-wallis tests were applied within each type of rf the 
results indicate that the relevance and usefulness of the terms chosen 
by irf is affected by the complexity of the search task the terms 
chosen are more relevant and useful when the search task is more 
complex 
relevant here was explained as being related to their task 
whereas useful was for terms that were seen as being helpful in the 
search task for erf the results indicate that the terms generated are 
perceived to be more relevant and useful for less complex search 
tasks although differences between tasks were not significant 
 this 
suggests that subject perceptions of the terms chosen for query 
modification are affected by task complexity comparison between 
erf and irf shows that subject perceptions also vary for different 
types of rf 
 
as well as using data on relevance and utility of the terms chosen we 
used data on term acceptance to measure the perceived value of the 
terms suggested explicit and implicit rf systems made 
recommendations about which terms could be added to the original

the average number of terms accepted from irf is approximately the 
same across all search tasks and generally the same as that of erf 
 
as table shows subjects marked fewer documents relevant for 
highly complex tasks therefore when task complexity increases the 
erf system has fewer examples of relevant documents and the 
expansion terms generated may be poorer this could explain the 
difference in the proportion of recommended terms accepted in erf 
as task complexity increases for irf there is little difference in how 
many of the recommended terms were chosen by subjects for each 
level of task complexity 
 subjects may have perceived irf terms as 
more useful for high complexity tasks but this was not reflected in the 
proportion of irf terms accepted differences may reside in the 
nature of the terms accepted future work will investigate this issue 
 summary 
in this section we have presented an investigation on the effect of 
search task complexity on the utility of irf from the results there 
appears to be a strong relation between the complexity of the task and 
the subject interaction subjects preferring irf for highly complex 
tasks task complexity did not affect the proportion of terms accepted 
in either rf method despite there being a difference in how 
relevant and useful subjects perceived the terms to be for different 
complexities complexity may affect term selection in ways other than 
the proportion of terms accepted 
 search experience 
experienced searchers may interact differently and give different 
types of evidence to rf than inexperienced searchers as such levels 
of search experience may affect searchers use and perceptions of irf 
in our experiment subjects were divided into two groups based on 
their level of search experience the frequency with which they 
searched and the types of searches they performed in this section we 
use their perceptions and logging to address the next research 
question the relationship between the usefulness and use of irf and 
the search experience of experimental subjects the data are the same 
as that analysed in the previous section but here we focus on search 
experience rather than the search task 
 feedback 
we analyse the results from the attitude statements described at the 
beginning of section i e how you conveyed relevance to the 
system was  and how you conveyed relevance to the system made

subjects about the rf method used in table we show the mean

the results demonstrate a strong preference in inexperienced subjects

the differences for all other irf differentials were not 
statistically significant for all differentials apart from in control 
inexperienced subjects generally preferred irf over erf 
 
inexperienced subjects also felt that irf was more difficult to control 
than experienced subjects 
 as these subjects have less search 
experience they may be less able to understand rf processes and may 
be more comfortable with the system gathering feedback implicitly 
from their interaction experienced subjects tended to like erf more 
than inexperienced subjects and felt more comfortable with this 
feedback method 
 it appears from these results that experienced 
subjects found erf more useful and were more at ease with the erf 
process 
in a similar way to section we analysed the proportion of 
feedback that searchers provided to the experimental systems our 
analysis suggested that search experience does not affect the amount 
of feedback subjects provide

terms offered irrespective of the type of rf 
 
 summary 
in this section we have analysed data gathered from two subject 
groups - inexperienced searchers and experienced searchers - on how 
they perceive and use irf the results indicate that inexperienced 
subjects found irf more easy and effective than experienced 
subjects who in turn found the terms chosen as a result of irf more 
relevant and useful we also showed that inexperienced subjects 
generally accepted less recommended terms than experienced 
subjects perhaps because they were less comfortable with rf or 
generally submitted shorter search queries search experience appears 
to affect how subjects use the terms recommended as a result of the 
rf process 
 search stage 
from our observations of experimental subjects as they searched we 
conjectured that rf may be used differently at different times during a 
search to test this our third research question concerned the use and 
usefulness of irf during the course of a search in this section we 
investigate whether the amount of rf provided by searchers or the 
proportion of terms accepted are affected by how far through their 
search they are for the purposes of this analysis a search begins when 
a subject poses the first query to the system and progresses until they 
terminate the search or reach the maximum allowed time for a search 
task of minutes we do not divide tasks based on this limit as 
subjects often terminated their search in less than minutes 
in this section we use data gathered from interaction logs and subject 
opinions to investigate the extent to which rf was used and the extent 
to which it appeared to benefit our experimental subjects at different 
stages in their search 
 feedback 
the interaction logs for all searches on the explicit rf and implicit 
rf were analysed and each search is divided up into nine equal length 
time slices this number of slices gave us an equal number per stage 
and was a sufficient level of granularity to identify trends in the 
results slices - correspond to the start of the search - to the 
middle of the search and - to the end in figure we plot the 
measure of precision described in section i e the proportion 
of all possible representations that were provided as rf at each of the 
 
irf u p erf u p 
nine slices per search task averaged across all subjects this allows us 
to see how the provision of rf was distributed during a search the 
total amount of feedback for a single rf method task complexity 
pairing across all nine slices corresponds to the value recorded in the 
first row of table e g the sum of the rf for irf hc across all nine 
slices of figure is to simplify the statistical analysis and

figure appears to show the existence of a relationship between the 
stage in the search and the amount of relevance information provided 
to the different types of feedback algorithm these are essentially 
differences in the way users are assessing documents in the case of 
erf subjects provide explicit relevance assessments throughout most 
of the search but there is generally a steep increase in the end phase 
towards the completion of the search 
 
when using the irf system the data indicates that at the start of the 
search subjects are providing little relevance information 
 which 
corresponds to interacting with few document representations at this 
stage the subjects are perhaps concentrating more on reading the 
retrieved results implicit relevance information is generally offered 
extensively in the middle of the search as they interact with results and 
it then tails off towards the end of the search this would appear to 
correspond to stages of initial exploration detailed analysis of 
document representations and storage and presentation of findings 
figure also shows the proportion of feedback for tasks of different 
complexity the results appear to show a difference 
in how irf is 
used that relates to the complexity of the search task more 
specifically as complexity increases it appears as though subjects take 
longer to reach their most interactive point this suggests that task 
complexity affects how irf is distributed during the search and that 
they may be spending more time initially interpreting search results 
for more complex tasks

 terms 
the terms recommended by the system are chosen based on the 
frequency of their occurrence in the relevant items that is 
nonstopword non-query terms occurring frequently in search results 
regarded as relevant are likely to be recommended to the searcher for 
query modification since there is a direct association between the rf 
and the terms selected we use the number of terms accepted by 
searchers at different points in the search as an indication of how 
effective the rf has been up until the current point in the search in 
this section we analysed the average number of terms from the top six 
terms recommended by explicit rf and implicit rf over the course of 
a search the average proportion of the top six recommended terms 
that were accepted at each stage are shown in table each cell

the results show an apparent association between the stage in the 
search and the number of feedback terms subjects accept search 
stage affects term acceptance in irf but not in erf 
 the further 
into a search a searcher progresses the more likely they are to accept 
terms recommended via irf significantly more than erf 
 a 
correlation analysis between the proportion of terms accepted at each 
search stage and cumulative rf i e the sum of all precision at each 
slice in figure up to and including the end of the search stage 
suggests that in both types of rf the quality of system terms improves 
as more rf is provided

the results from this section indicate that the location in a search 
affects the amount of feedback given by the user to the system and 
hence the amount of information that the rf mechanism has to decide 
which terms to offer the user further trends in the data suggest that 
the complexity of the task affects how subjects provide irf and the 
proportion of system terms accepted 
 discussion and implications 
in this section we discuss the implications of the findings presented in 
the previous section for each research question 
 search task 
the results of our study showed that erf was preferred for less 
complex tasks and irf for more complex tasks from observations 
and subject comments we perceived that when using erf systems 
subjects generally forgot to provide the feedback but also employed 
different criteria during the erf process i e they were assessing 
relevance rather than expressing an interest when the search was 
more complex subjects rarely found results they regarded as 
completely relevant therefore they struggled to find relevant

information and were unable to communicate rf to the search system 
in these situations subjects appeared to prefer irf as they do not need 
to make a relevance decision to obtain the benefits of rf i e term 
suggestions whereas in erf they do 
the association between rf method and task complexity has 
implications for the design of user studies of rf systems and the rf 
systems themselves it implies that in the design of user studies 
involving erf or irf systems care should be taken to include tasks of 
varying complexities to avoid task bias also in the design of search 
systems it implies that since different types of rf may be appropriate 
for different task complexities then a system that could automatically 
detect complexity could use both erf and irf simultaneously to 
benefit the searcher for example on the irf system we noticed that 
as task complexity falls search behaviour shifts from results interface 
to retrieved documents monitoring such interaction across a number 
of studies may lead to a set of criteria that could help ir systems 
automatically detect task complexity and tailor support to suit 
 search experience 
we analysed the affect of search experience on the utility of irf our 
analysis revealed a general preference across all subjects for irf over 
erf that is the average ratings assigned to irf were generally more 
positive than those assigned to erf however irf was generally 
liked by both subject groups perhaps because it removed the burden 
of providing relevance information and erf was generally preferred 
by experienced subjects more than inexperienced subjects perhaps 
because it allowed them to specify which results were used by the 
system when generating term recommendations 
all subjects felt more in control with erf than irf but for 
inexperienced subjects this did not appear to affect their overall 
preferences 
 these subjects may understand the rf process less but 
may be more willing to sacrifice control over feedback in favour of 
irf a process that they perceive more positively 
 search stage 
we also analysed the effects of search stage on the use and usefulness 
of irf through analysis of this nature we can build a more complete 
picture of how searchers used rf and how this varies based on the rf 
method the results suggest that irf is used more in the middle of 
the search than at the beginning or end whereas erf is used more 
towards the end the results also show the effects of task complexity 
on the irf process and how rapidly subjects reach their most 
interactive point without an analysis of this type it would not have 
been possible to establish the existence of such patterns of behaviour 
the findings suggest that searchers interact differently for irf and 
erf since erf is not traditionally used until toward the end of the 
search it may be possible to incorporate both irf and erf into the 
same ir system with irf being used to gather evidence until subjects 
decide to use erf the development of such a system represents part 
of our ongoing work in this area 
 conclusions 
in this paper we have presented an investigation of implicit relevance 
feedback irf we aimed to answer three research questions about 
factors that may affect the provision and usefulness of irf these 
factors were search task complexity the subjects search experience 
and the stage in the search our overall conclusion was that all factors 
 
this may also be true for experienced subjects but the data we have 
is insufficient to draw this conclusion 
appear to have some effect on the use and effectiveness of irf 
although the interaction effects between factors are not statistically 
significant 
our conclusions per each research question are i irf is generally 
more useful for complex search tasks where searchers want to focus 
on the search task and get new ideas for their search from the system 
 ii irf is preferred to erf overall and generally preferred by 
inexperienced subjects wanting to reduce the burden of providing rf 
and iii within a single search session irf is affected by temporal 
location in a search i e it is used in the middle not the beginning or 
end and task complexity 
studies of this nature are important to establish the circumstances 
where a promising technique such as irf are useful and those when it 
is not it is only after such studies have been run and analysed in this 
way can we develop an understanding of irf that allow it to be 
successfully implemented in operational ir systems
