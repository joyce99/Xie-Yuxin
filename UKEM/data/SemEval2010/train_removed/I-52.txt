abstract 
this paper proposes a unified and general framework for 
argumentation-based negotiation in which the role of 
argumentation is formally analyzed the framework makes it 
possible to study the outcomes of an argumentation-based 
negotiation it shows what an agreement is how it is related 
to the theories of the agents when it is possible and how 
this can be attained by the negotiating agents in this case 
it defines also the notion of concession and shows in which 
situation an agent will make one as well as how it influences 
the evolution of the dialogue

 introduction 
roughly speaking negotiation is a process aiming at 
finding some compromise or consensus between two or several 
agents about some matters of collective agreement such 
as pricing products allocating resources or choosing 
candidates negotiation models have been proposed for the 
design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with 
other agents for example buying or selling products in 
ecommerce 
different approaches to automated negotiation have been 
investigated including game-theoretic approaches which 
usually assume complete information and unlimited 
computation capabilities heuristic-based approaches which try 
to cope with these limitations and argumentation-based 
approaches which emphasize the 
importance of exchanging information and explanations between 
negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their 
behaviors e g an agent may concede a goal having a small 
priority and consequently the outcome of the dialogue 
indeed the two first types of settings do not allow for the 
addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers 
integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a 
good means for supplying additional information and also 
helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments 
during a negotiation dialogue indeed an offer supported 
by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by 
an agent and can also make him reveal his goals or give 
up some of them the basic idea behind an 
argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments the 
theories of the agents i e their mental states may evolve and 
consequently the status of offers may change for instance 
an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for 
it however the agent may change its mind if it receives a 
strong argument in favor of this offer 
several proposals have been made in the literature for 
modeling such an approach however the work is still 
preliminary some researchers have mainly focused on relating 
argumentation with protocols they have shown how and 
when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and 
exchanged others have emphasized on the decision making 
problem in the authors argued that selecting an offer 
to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision 
making problem they have thus proposed an 
argumentationbased decision model and have shown how such a model 
can be related to the dialogue protocol 
in most existing works there is no deep formal analysis 
of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues it is 
not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of 
the dialogue moreover basic concepts in negotiation such 
as agreement i e optimal solutions or compromise and 
concession are neither defined nor studied 
this paper aims to propose a unified and general framework 
for argumentation-based negotiation in which the role of 
argumentation is formally analyzed and where the existing 
systems can be restated in this framework a negotiation 
dialogue takes place between two agents on a set o of offers 
whose structure is not known the goal of a negotiation is to 
find among elements of o an offer that satisfies more or less 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
the preferences of both agents each agent is supposed to 
have a theory represented in an abstract way a theory 
consists of a set a of arguments whose structure and origin are 
not known a function specifying for each possible offer in o 
the arguments of a that support it a non specified conflict 
relation among the arguments and finally a preference 
relation between the arguments the status of each argument is 
defined using dung s acceptability semantics consequently 
the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets acceptable 
rejected negotiable and non-supported offers we show how 
an agent s theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue 
we define formally the notions of concession compromise 
and optimal solution then we propose a protocol that 
allows agents i to exchange offers and arguments and ii to 
make concessions when necessary we show that dialogues 
generated under such a protocol terminate and even reach 
optimal solutions when they exist 
this paper is organized as follows section introduces the 
logical language that is used in the rest of the paper 
section defines the agents as well as their theories in section 
 we study the properties of these agents theories 
section defines formally an argumentation-based negotiation 
shows how the theories of agents may evolve during a 
dialogue and how this evolution may influence the outcome of 
the dialogue two kinds of outcomes optimal solution and 
compromise are defined and we show when such outcomes 
are reached section illustrates our general framework 
through some examples section compares our formalism 
with existing ones section concludes and presents some 
perspectives due to lack of space the proofs are not 
included these last are in a technical report that we will 
make available online at some later time 
 the logical language 
in what follows l will denote a logical language and ≡ 
is an equivalence relation associated with it 
from l a set o o on of n offers is identified such 
that oi oj ∈ o such that oi ≡ oj this means that the 
offers are different offers correspond to the different 
alternatives that can be exchanged during a negotiation dialogue 
for instance if the agents try to decide the place of their 
next meeting then the set o will contain different towns 
different arguments can be built from l the set args l 
will contain all those arguments by argument we mean a 
reason in believing or of doing something in it has been 
argued that the selection of the best offer to propose at a 
given step of the dialogue is a decision problem in it has 
been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for 
decision making two kinds of arguments are distinguished 
arguments supporting choices or decisions and arguments 
supporting beliefs moreover it has been acknowledged that 
the two categories of arguments are formally defined in 
different ways and they play different roles indeed an 
argument in favor of a decision built both on an agent s 
beliefs and goals tries to justify the choice whereas an 
argument in favor of a belief built only from beliefs tries 
to destroy the decision arguments in particular the beliefs 
part of those decision arguments consequently in a 
negotiation dialogue those two kinds of arguments are generally 
exchanged between agents in what follows the set args l 
is then divided into two subsets a subset argso l of 
arguments supporting offers and a subset argsb l of arguments 
supporting beliefs thus args l argso l ∪ argsb l 
as in in what follows we consider that the structure of 
the arguments is not known 
since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built 
may be inconsistent the arguments may be conflicting too 
in what follows those conflicts will be captured by the 
relation rl thus rl ⊆ args l × args l three assumptions 
are made on this relation first the arguments supporting 
different offers are conflicting the idea behind this 
assumption is that since offers are exclusive an agent has to choose 
only one at a given step of the dialogue note that the 
relation rl is not necessarily symmetric between the 
arguments of argsb l the second hypothesis says that 
arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting the 
idea here is to return the strongest argument among these 
arguments the third condition does not allow an argument 
in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a 
belief this avoids wishful thinking formally 
definition rl ⊆ args l × args l is a conflict 
relation among arguments such that 
 ∀a a ∈ argso l s t a a a rl a 
 a ∈ argso l and a ∈ argsb l such that a rl a 
note that the relation rl is not symmetric this is due 
to the fact that arguments of argsb l may be conflicting 
but not necessarily in a symmetric way in what follows we 
assume that the set args l of arguments is finite and each 
argument is attacked by a finite number of arguments 
 negotiating agents theories and 
reasoning models 
in this section we define formally the negotiating agents 
i e their theories as well as the reasoning model used by 
those agents in a negotiation dialogue 
 negotiating agents theories 
agents involved in a negotiation dialogue called 
negotiating agents are supposed to have theories in this paper the 
theory of an agent will not refer as usual to its mental states 
 i e its beliefs desires and intentions however it will be 
encoded in a more abstract way in terms of the arguments 
owned by the agent a conflict relation among those 
arguments a preference relation between the arguments and a 
function that specifies which arguments support offers of the 
set o we assume that an agent is aware of all the 
arguments of the set args l the agent is even able to express 
a preference between any pair of arguments this does not 
mean that the agent will use all the arguments of args l 
but it encodes the fact that when an agent receives an 
argument from another agent it can interpret it correctly and it 
can also compare it with its own arguments similarly each 
agent is supposed to be aware of the conflicts between 
arguments this also allows us to encode the fact that an agent 
can recognize whether the received argument is in conflict 
or not with its arguments however in its theory only the 
conflicts between its own arguments are considered 
definition negotiating agent theory let o 
be a set of n offers a negotiating agent theory is a tuple 
a f r def such that 
 a ⊆ args l

s t ∀i j with i j f oi ∩ f oj ∅ 
let ao ∪f oi with i n 
 ⊆ args l × args l is a partial preorder denoting 
a preference relation between arguments 
 r ⊆ rl such that r ⊆ a × a 
 def ⊆ a × a such that ∀ a b ∈ a a defeats b denoted 
a def b iff 
- a r b and 
- not b a 
the function f returns the arguments supporting offers in 
o in it has been argued that any decision may have 
arguments supporting it called arguments pro and 
arguments against it called arguments cons moreover these 
two types of arguments are not necessarily conflicting for 
simplicity reasons in this paper we consider only arguments 
pro moreover we assume that an argument cannot 
support two distinct offers however it may be the case that an 
offer is not supported at all by arguments thus f oi may 
be empty 
example let o o o o be a set of offers the 
following theory is the theory of agent i 
 a a a a a 
 f o a f o a f o ∅ thus ao

from the above definition of agent theory the following hold 
property 
 def ⊆ r 
 ∀a a ∈ f oi a r a 
 the reasoning model 
from the theory of an agent one can define the 
argumentation system used by that agent for reasoning about the 
offers and the arguments i e for computing the status of 
the different offers and arguments 
definition argumentation system let a f 
 r def be the theory of an agent the argumentation 
system of that agent is the pair a def 
in different acceptability semantics have been introduced 
for computing the status of arguments these are based 
on two basic concepts defence and conflict-free defined as 
follows 
definition defence conflict-free let s ⊆ a 
 s defends an argument a iff each argument that defeats 
a is defeated by some argument in s 
 s is conflict-free iff there exist no a a in s such that 
a def a 
definition acceptability semantics let s be 
a conflict-free set of arguments and let t a 
→ a 
be a 
function such that t s a a is defended by s 
 s is a complete extension iff s t s 
 s is a preferred extension iff s is a maximal w r t set 
⊆ complete extension 
 s is a grounded extension iff it is the smallest w r t 
set ⊆ complete extension 
let e ex denote the different extensions under a given 
semantics 
note that there is only one grounded extension it 
contains all the arguments that are not defeated and those 
arguments that are defended directly or indirectly by 
nondefeated arguments 
theorem let a def the argumentation system 
defined as shown above 
 it may have x ≥ preferred extensions 
 the grounded extensions is s i≥ 
t ∅ 
note that when the grounded extension or the preferred 
extension is empty this means that there is no acceptable 
offer for the negotiating agent 
example in example there is one preferred 
extension e a a a 
now that the acceptability semantics is defined we are ready 
to define the status of any argument 
definition argument status let a def be an 
argumentation system and e ex its extensions under a 
given semantics let a ∈ a 
 a is accepted iff a ∈ ei ∀ei with i x 
 a is rejected iff ei such that a ∈ ei 
 a is undecided iff a is neither accepted nor rejected 
this means that a is in some extensions and not in 
others 
note that a a a is accepted ∪ a a is rejected ∪ a a 
is undecided 
example in example the arguments a a and a 
are accepted whereas the argument a is rejected 
as said before agents use argumentation systems for 
reasoning about offers in a negotiation dialogue agents propose 
and accept offers that are acceptable for them and reject 
bad ones in what follows we will define the status of an 
offer according to the status of arguments one can define 
four statuses of the offers as follows 
definition offers status let o ∈ o 
 the offer o is acceptable for the negotiating agent iff 
∃ a ∈ f o such that a is accepted oa oi ∈ o 
such that oi is acceptable 
 the offer o is rejected for the negotiating agent iff ∀ 
a ∈ f o a is rejected or oi ∈ o such that oi is 
rejected 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 the offer o is negotiable iff ∀ a ∈ f o a is undecided 
on oi ∈ o such that oi is negotiable 
 the offer o is non-supported iff it is neither 
acceptable nor rejected or negotiable ons oi ∈ o such 
that oi is non-supported offers 
example in example the two offers o and o are 
acceptable since they are supported by accepted arguments 
whereas the offer o is non-supported since it has no 
argument in its favor 
from the above definitions the following results hold 
property let o ∈ o 
 o oa ∪ or ∪ on ∪ ons 
 the set oa may contain more than one offer 
from the above partition of the set o of offers a preference 
relation between offers is defined let ox and oy be two 
subsets of o ox oy means that any offer in ox is 
preferred to any offer in the set oy we can write also for two 
offers oi oj oi oj iff oi ∈ ox oj ∈ oy and ox oy 
definition preference between offers let o 
be a set of offers and oa or on ons its partition oa 
on ons or 
example in example we have o o and o o 
however o and o are indifferent 
 the structure of negotiation 
theories 
in this section we study the properties of the system 
developed above we first show that in the particular case 
where a ao ie all of the agent s arguments refer to 
offers the corresponding argumentation system will return 
at least one non-empty preferred extension 
theorem let a def an argumentation system such 
that a ao then the system returns at least one 
extension e such that e ≥ 
we now present some results that demonstrate the 
importance of indifference in negotiating agents and more 
specifically its relation to acceptable outcomes we first show that 
the set oa may contain several offers when their 
corresponding accepted arguments are indifferent w r t the preference 
relation 
theorem let o o ∈ o o o ∈ oa iff ∃ a ∈ 
f o ∃ a ∈ f o such that a and a are accepted and 
are indifferent w r t i e a b and b a 
we now study acyclic preference relations that are defined 
formally as follows 
definition acyclic relation a relation r on 
a set a is acyclic if there is no sequence a a an ∈ a 
with n such that ai ai ∈ r and an a ∈ r with 
 ≤ i n 
note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a b such 
that a b and b a ie an acyclic preference relation 
disallows indifference 
theorem let a be a set of arguments r the 
attacking relation of a defined as r ⊆ a × a and an acyclic 
relation on a then for any pair of arguments a b ∈ a 
such that a b ∈ r either a b ∈ def or b a ∈ def or 
both 
the previous result is used in the proof of the following 
theorem that states that acyclic preference relations 
sanction extensions that support exactly one offer 
theorem let a be a set of arguments and an 
acyclic relation on a if e is an extension of a def 
then e ∩ ao 
an immediate consequence of the above is the following 
property let a be a set of arguments such that a 
ao if the relation on a is acyclic then each extension 
ei of a def ei 
another direct consequence of the above theorem is that 
in acyclic preference relations arguments that support offers 
can participate in only one preferred extension 
theorem let a be a set of arguments and an 
acyclic relation on a then the preferred extensions of 
a def are pairwise disjoint w r t arguments of ao 
using the above results we can prove the main theorem of 
this section that states that negotiating agents with acyclic 
preference relations do not have acceptable offers 
theorem let a f r def be a negotiating 
agent such that a ao and is an acyclic relation then 
the set of accepted arguments w r t a def is emtpy 
consequently the set of acceptable offers oa is empty as well 
 argumentation-based negotiation 
in this section we define formally a protocol that 
generates argumentation-based negotiation dialogues between 
two negotiating agents p and c the two agents 
negotiate about an object whose possible values belong to a set 
o this set o is supposed to be known and the same for 
both agents for simplicity reasons we assume that this 
set does not change during the dialogue the agents are 
equipped with theories denoted respectively ap 
 fp 
 p 
 
rp 
 defp 
 and ac 
 fc 
 c 
 rc 
 defc 
 note that the 
two theories may be different in the sense that the agents 
may have different sets of arguments and different 
preference relations worst yet they may have different 
arguments in favor of the same offers moreover these theories 
may evolve during the dialogue 
 evolution of the theories 
before defining formally the evolution of an agent s theory 
let us first introduce the notion of dialogue moves or moves 
for short 
definition move a move is a tuple mi pi 
ai oi ti such that 
 pi ∈ p c 
 ai ∈ args l ∪ θ 
 
in what follows θ denotes the fact that no argument or no 
offer is given 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 oi ∈ o ∪ θ 
 ti ∈ n 
is the target of the move such that ti i 
the function player resp argument offer target 
returns the player of the move i e pi resp the argument 
of a move i e ai the offer oi and the target of the move 
ti let m denote the set of all the moves that can be built 
from p c arg l o 
note that the set m is finite since arg l and o are 
assumed to be finite let us now see how an agent s theory 
evolves and why the idea is that if an agent receives an 
argument from another agent it will add the new argument 
to its theory moreover since an argument may bring new 
information for the agent thus new arguments can emerge 
let us take the following example 
example suppose that an agent p has the following 
propositional knowledge base σp x y → z from this 
base one cannot deduce z let s assume that this agent 
receives the following argument a a → y that justifies y 
it is clear that now p can build an argument say a a → 
y y → z in favor of z 
in a similar way if a received argument is in conflict with the 
arguments of the agent i then those conflicts are also added 
to its relation ri 
 note that new conflicts may arise between 
the original arguments of the agent and the ones that emerge 
after adding the received arguments to its theory those new 
conflicts should also be considered as a direct consequence 
of the evolution of the sets ai 
and ri 
 the defeat relation 
defi 
is also updated 
the initial theory of an agent i i e its theory before the 
dialogue starts is denoted by ai 
 fi 
 i 
 ri 
 defi 
 with 
i ∈ p c besides in this paper we suppose that the 
preference relation i 
of an agent does not change during 
the dialogue 
definition theory evolution let m mt 
 mj be a sequence of moves the theory of an agent i at 
a step t is ai 
t fi 
t i 
t ri 
t defi 
t such that 
 ai 
t ai 
 ∪ ai i t ai argument mi ∪ 
a with a ⊆ args l 
 fi 
t o → ai 
t 
 i 
t i 
 
 ri 
t ri 
 ∪ ai aj ai argument mi 
aj argument mj i j ≤ t and ai rl aj ∪ r with 
r ⊆ rl 
 defi 
t ⊆ ai 
t × ai 
t 
the above definition captures the monotonic aspect of an 
argument indeed an argument cannot be removed 
however its status may change an argument that is accepted 
at step t of the dialogue by an agent may become rejected 
at step t i consequently the status of offers also change 
thus the sets oa or on and ons may change from one 
step of the dialogue to another that means for example 
that some offers could move from the set oa to the set or 
and vice-versa note that in the definition of rt the 
relation rl is used to denote a conflict between exchanged 
arguments the reason is that such a conflict may not be 
in the set ri 
of the agent i thus in order to recognize 
such conflicts we have supposed that the set rl is known 
to the agents this allows us to capture the situation where 
an agent is able to prove an argument that it was unable 
to prove before by incorporating in its beliefs some 
information conveyed through the exchange of arguments with 
another agent this unknown at the beginning of the 
dialogue argument could give to this agent the possibility to 
defeat an argument that it could not by using its initial 
arguments this could even lead to a change of the status of 
these initial arguments and this change would lead to the 
one of the associated offers status 
in what follows oi 
t x denotes the set of offers of type x 
where x ∈ a n r ns of the agent i at step t of the 
dialogue in some places we can use for short the notation oi 
t 
to denote the partition of the set o at step t for agent i 
note that we have not oi 
t x ⊆ oi 
t x 
 the notion of agreement 
as said in the introduction negotiation is a process aiming 
at finding an agreement about some matters by agreement 
one means a solution that satisfies to the largest possible 
extent the preferences of both agents in case there is no such 
solution we say that the negotiation fails in what follows 
we will discuss the different kinds of solutions that may be 
reached in a negotiation the first one is the optimal 
solution an optimal solution is the best offer for both agents 
formally 
definition optimal solution let o be a set 
of offers and o ∈ o the offer o is an optimal solution at 
a step t ≥ iff o ∈ op 
t a ∩ oc 
t a 
such a solution does not always exist since agents may have 
conflicting preferences thus agents make concessions by 
proposing accepting less preferred offers 
definition concession let o ∈ o be an offer 
the offer o is a concession for an agent i iff o ∈ oi 
x such 
that ∃oi 
y ∅ and oi 
y oi 
x 
during a negotiation dialogue agents exchange first their 
most preferred offers and if these last are rejected they 
make concessions in this case we say that their best offers 
are no longer defendable in an argumentation setting this 
means that the agent has already presented all its arguments 
supporting its best offers and it has no counter argument 
against the ones presented by the other agent formally 
definition defendable offer let ai 
t fi 
t i 
t 
ri 
t defi 
t be the theory of agent i at a step t of the 
dialogue let o ∈ o such that ∃j ≤ t with player mj i and 
offer mj o the offer o is defendable by the agent i iff 
 ∃a ∈ fi 
t o and k ≤ t s t argument mk a or 
 ∃a ∈ at 
\fi 
t o s t a defi 
t b with 
- argument mk b k ≤ t and player mk i 
- l ≤ t argument ml a 
the offer o is said non-defendable otherwise and ndi 
t is the 
set of non-defendable offers of agent i at a step t 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 negotiation dialogue 
now that we have shown how the theories of the agents 
evolve during a dialogue we are ready to define formally 
an argumentation-based negotiation dialogue for that 
purpose we need to define first the notion of a legal 
continuation 
definition legal move a move m is a legal 
continuation of a sequence of moves m ml iff j k l 
such that 
 offer mj offer mk and 
 player mj player mk 
the idea here is that if the two agents present the same 
offer then the dialogue should terminate and there is no 
longer possible continuation of the dialogue 
definition argumentation-based negotiation 
an argumentation-based negotiation dialogue d between two 
agents p and c is a non-empty sequence of moves m ml 
such that 
 pi p iff i is even and pi c iff i is odd 
 player m p argument m θ offer m θ 
and target m 
 ∀ mi if offer mi θ then offer mi oj ∀ oj ∈ 
o\ o 
player mi 
i r ∪ nd 
player mi 
i 
 ∀i l mi is a legal continuation of m mi− 
 target mi mj such that j i and player mi 
player mj 
 if argument mi θ then 
- if offer mi θ then argument mi ∈ f offer mi 
- if offer mi θ then argument mi def 
player mi 
i 
argument target mi 
 i j ≤ l such that mi mj 
 m ∈ m such that m is a legal continuation of m ml 
let d be the set of all possible dialogues 
the first condition says that the two agents take turn the 
second condition says that agent p starts the negotiation 
dialogue by presenting an offer note that in the first turn 
we suppose that the agent does not present an argument 
this assumption is made for strategical purposes indeed 
arguments are exchanged as soon as a conflict appears the 
third condition ensures that agents exchange their best 
offers but never the rejected ones this condition takes also 
into account the concessions that an agent will have to make 
if it was established that a concession is the only option for 
it at the current state of the dialogue of course as we 
have shown in a previous section an agent may have several 
good or acceptable offers in this case the agent chooses 
one of them randomly the fourth condition ensures that 
the moves are legal this condition allows to terminate the 
dialogue as soon as an offer is presented by both agents 
the fifth condition allows agents to backtrack the sixth 
 
the first move has no target 
condition says that an agent may send arguments in favor 
of offers and in this case the offer should be stated in the 
same move an agent can also send arguments in order to 
defeat arguments of the other agent the next condition 
prevents repeating the same move this is useful for 
avoiding loops the last condition ensures that all the possible 
legal moves have been presented 
the outcome of a negotiation dialogue is computed as 
follows 
definition dialogue outcome let d m 
ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue the 
outcome of this dialogue denoted outcome is outcome d 
offer ml iff ∃j l s t offer ml offer mj and 
player ml player mj otherwise outcome d θ 
note that when outcome d θ the negotiation fails and 
no agreement is reached by the two agents however if 
outcome d θ the negotiation succeeds and a solution 
that is either optimal or a compromise is found 
theorem ∀di ∈ d the argumentation-based 
negotiation di terminates 
the above result is of great importance since it shows that 
the proposed protocol avoids loops and dialogues terminate 
another important result shows that the proposed protocol 
ensures to reach an optimal solution if it exists formally 
theorem completeness let d m ml be 
a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue if ∃t ≤ l such 
that op 
t a ∩ oc 
t a ∅ then outcome d ∈ op 
t a ∩ oc 
t a 
we show also that the proposed dialogue protocol is sound 
in the sense that if a dialogue returns a solution then that 
solution is for sure a compromise in other words that 
solution is a common agreement at a given step of the 
dialogue we show also that if the negotiation fails then there 
is no possible solution 
theorem soundness let d m ml be a 
argumentation-based negotiation dialogue 
 if outcome d o o θ then ∃t ≤ l such that o ∈ 
op 
t x ∩ oc 
t y with x y ∈ a n ns 
 if outcome d θ then ∀t ≤ l op 
t x ∩ oc 
t y ∅ ∀ 
x y ∈ a n ns 
a direct consequence of the above theorem is the following 
property let d m ml be a 
argumentationbased negotiation dialogue if outcome d θ then ∀t ≤ l 
 op 
t r oc 
t a ∪ oc 
t n ∪ oc 
t ns and 
 oc 
t r op 
t a ∪ op 
t n ∪ op

 illustrative examples 
in this section we will present some examples in order to 
illustrate our general framework 
example no argumentation let o o o 
be the set of all possible offers let p and c be two agents 
equipped with the same theory a f r def such that 
a ∅ f o f o ∅ ∅ r ∅ def ∅ in 
this case it is clear that the two offers o and o are 
nonsupported the proposed protocol see definition will 
generate one of the following dialogues 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
p m p θ o 
c m c θ o 
this dialogue ends with o as a compromise note that this 
solution is not considered as optimal since it is not an 
acceptable offer for the agents 
p m p θ o 
c m c θ o 
p m p θ o 
this dialogue ends with o as a compromise 
p m p θ o 
c m c θ o 
this dialogue also ends with o as a compromise the last 
possible dialgue is the following that ends with o as a

note that in the above example since there is no exchange 
of arguments the theories of both agents do not change let 
us now consider the following example 
example static theories let o o o be 
the set of all possible offers the theory of agent p is ap

 rp 
 defp 
such that ap

of 
this agent will return a as an accepted argument and a as 
a rejected one consequently the offer o is acceptable and 
o is rejected 
the theory of agent c is ac

 a a the 
argumentation system ac 
 defc 
of this agent will return 
a as an accepted argument and a as a rejected one 
consequently the offer o is acceptable and o is rejected 
the only possible dialogues that may take place between 
the two agents are the following 
p m p θ o 
c m c θ o 
p m p a o 
c m c a o 
the second possible dialogue is the following 
p m p θ o 
c m c a o 
p m p a o 
c m c θ o 
both dialogues end with failure note that in both dialogues 
the theories of both agents do not change the reason is that 
the exchanged arguments are already known to both agents 
the negotiation fails because the agents have conflicting 
preferences 
let us now consider an example in which argumentation will 
allow agents to reach an agreement 
example dynamic theories let o o o be 
the set of all possible offers the theory of agent p is ap

the following dialogue may take place between the two 
agents 
p m p θ o 
c m c θ o 
p m p a o 
c m c a θ 
c m p θ o 
at step of the dialogue the agent p receives the 
argument a from p thus its theory evolves as follows ap 
 a a a rp 
 a a a a a a defp 
 
 a a a a at this step the argument a which was 
accepted will become rejected and the argument a which 
was at the beginning of the dialogue rejected will become 
accepted thus the offer o will be acceptable for the agent 
whereas o will become rejected at this step the offer o 
is acceptable for both agents thus it is an optimal solution 
the dialogue ends by returning this offer as an outcome 
 related work 
argumentation has been integrated in negotiation 
dialogues at the early nineties by sycara in that work the 
author has emphasized the advantages of using 
argumentation in negotiation dialogues and a specific framework has 
been introduced in the different types of arguments 
that are used in a negotiation dialogue such as threats and 
rewards have been discussed moreover a particular 
framework for negotiation have been proposed in 
different other frameworks have been proposed even if all these 
frameworks are based on different logics and use different 
definitions of arguments they all have at their heart an 
exchange of offers and arguments however none of those 
proposals explain when arguments can be used within a 
negotiation and how they should be dealt with by the agent 
that receives them thus the protocol for handling 
arguments was missing another limitation of the above 
frameworks is the fact that the argumentation frameworks they 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
use are quite poor since they use a very simple 
acceptability semantics in a negotiation framework that fills the 
gap has been suggested a protocol that handles the 
arguments was proposed however the notion of concession 
is not modeled in that framework and it is not clear what 
is the status of the outcome of the dialogue moreover it 
is not clear how an agent chooses the offer to propose at a 
given step of the dialogue in the authors have 
focused mainly on this decision problem they have proposed 
an argumentation-based decision framework that is used by 
agents in order to choose the offer to propose or to accept 
during the dialogue in that work agents are supposed to 
have a beliefs base and a goals base 
our framework is more general since it does not impose 
any specific structure for the arguments the offers or the 
beliefs the negotiation protocol is general as well thus this 
framework can be instantiated in different ways by creating 
in such manner different specific argumentation-based 
negotiation frameworks all of them respecting the same 
properties our framework is also a unified one because frameworks 
like the ones presented above can be represented within this 
framework for example the decision making mechanism 
proposed in for the evaluation of arguments and 
therefore of offers which is based on a priority relation between 
mutually attacked arguments can be captured by the 
relation defeat proposed in our framework this relation takes 
simultaneously into account the attacking and preference 
relations that may exist between two arguments 
 conclusions and future work 
in this paper we have presented a unified and general 
framework for argumentation-based negotiation like any 
other argumentation-based negotiation framework as it is 
evoked in e g our framework has all the advantages 
that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present 
when related to the negotiation approaches based either on 
game theoretic models see e g or heuristics this 
work is a first attempt to formally define the role of 
argumentation in the negotiation process more precisely for the 
first time it formally establishes the link that exists between 
the status of the arguments and the offers they support it 
defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences 
the evolution of the negotiation it determines how the 
theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an 
analysis of the negotiation outcomes it is also the first time 
where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation 
theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative 
negotiation dialogue is presented 
our future work concerns several points a first point is 
to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the 
same to both agents indeed it is more natural to assume 
that agents may have different sets of offers during a 
negotiation dialogue these sets will evolve arguments in favor 
of the new offers may be built from the agent theory thus 
the set of offers will be part of the agent theory another 
possible extension of this work would be to allow agents 
to handle both arguments pro and cons offers this is 
more akin to the way human take decisions considering 
both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the 
offers status in the proposed model a preference relation 
between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the 
set of offers this preference relation can be refined for 
instance among the acceptable offers one may prefer the 
offer that is supported by the strongest argument in 
different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions 
our framework can thus be extended by integrating those 
criteria another interesting point to investigate is that of 
considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with 
different profiles by profile we mean the criterion used by 
an agent to compare its offers
