abstract 
wireless radios of the future will likely be frequency-agile 
that is supporting opportunistic and adaptive use of the rf 
spectrum such radios must coordinate with each other to 
build an accurate and consistent map of spectral 
utilization in their surroundings we focus on the problem of 
sharing rf spectrum data among a collection of wireless 
devices the inherent requirements of such data and the 
time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this 
problem both interesting and technically challenging we 
propose guess a novel incremental gossiping approach to 
coordinated spectral sensing it reduces protocol 
overhead by limiting the amount of information exchanged 
between participating nodes is resilient to network 
alterations due to node movement or node failures and 
allows exponentially-fast information convergence we outline 
an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show 
how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a 
factor of and results in up to times faster information 
convergence than alternative approaches

 introduction 
there has recently been a huge surge in the growth of 
wireless technology driven primarily by the availability of 
unlicensed spectrum however this has come at the cost 
of increased rf interference which has caused the federal 
communications commission fcc in the united states to 
re-evaluate its strategy on spectrum allocation currently 
the fcc has licensed rf spectrum to a variety of public and 
private institutions termed primary users new spectrum 
allocation regimes implemented by the fcc use dynamic 
spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or 
opportunistically allocate rf spectrum to unlicensed secondary users

figure without cooperation shadowed users are not 
able to detect the presence of the primary user 
that can use it when the primary user is absent the second 
type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum 
sharing the fcc has already legislated this access method 
for the ghz band and is also considering the same for 
tv broadcast bands as a result a new wave of 
intelligent radios termed cognitive radios or software defined 
radios is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their 
radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding 
environment 
under the new opportunistic allocation strategy 
secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary 
users senders or receivers this can be done by sensing 
the environment to detect the presence of primary users 
however local sensing is not always adequate especially in 
cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary 
user as illustrated in figure here coordination between 
secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to 
detect the primary in general cooperation improves sensing 
accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not 
cooperating at all 
to realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access two 
fundamental problems must be solved efficient and 
coordinated spectrum sensing and distributed spectrum 
allocation in this paper we propose strategies for coordinated 
spectrum sensing that are low cost operate on timescales 
comparable to the agility of the rf environment and are 
resilient to network failures and alterations we defer the 
problem of spectrum allocation to future work 
spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks 
 are broadly classified into three regimes 
centralized coordinated techniques decentralized coordinated 
techniques and decentralized uncoordinated techniques 
we advocate a decentralized coordinated approach similar 
in spirit to ospf link-state routing used in the internet 
this is more effective than uncoordinated approaches 
because making decisions based only on local information is 
fallible as shown in figure moreover compared to 
cen 
tralized approaches decentralized techniques are more 
scalable robust and resistant to network failures and security 
attacks e g jamming 
coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices 
is technically challenging because accurately assessing 
spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of 
data with many radios at very short time scales data size 
grows rapidly due to the large number i e thousands of 
spectrum bands that must be scanned this data must also 
be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring 
secondary users at short time scales to account for rapid 
changes in the rf environment 
this paper presents guess a novel approach to 
coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks our 
approach is motivated by the following key observations 
 low-cost sensors collect approximate data most 
devices have limited sensing resolution because they are 
low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot 
perform complex rf signal processing e g matched 
filtering many are typically equipped with simple 
energy detectors that gather only approximate 
information 
 approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination 
approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are 
sufficient for correlating sensed information between 
radios as relative usage information is more 
important than absolute usage data thus exchanging 
exact rf information may not be necessary and more 
importantly too costly for the purposes of spectrum 
sensing 
 rf spectrum changes incrementally on most bands 
rf spectrum utilization changes infrequently 
moreover utilization of a specific rf band affects only that 
band and not the entire spectrum therefore if the 
usage pattern of a particular band changes 
substantially nodes detecting that change can initiate an 
update protocol to update the information for that band 
alone leaving in place information already collected 
for other bands this allows rapid detection of change 
while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary 
information 
based on these observations guess makes the following 
contributions 
 a novel approach that applies randomized gossiping 
algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum 
sensing these algorithms are well suited to coordinated 
spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of 
the problem i e radios are power-limited mobile and 
have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing 
capabilities 
 an application of in-network aggregation for 
dissemination of spectrum summaries we argue that 
approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate 
radio parameter tuning 
 an extension of in-network aggregation and 
randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of 
spectrum summaries compared to standard 
gossiping approaches incremental techniques can further 
reduce overhead and protocol execution time by 
requiring fewer radio resources 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 
motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to 
coordinated spectrum sensing section discusses related 
work in the area while section provides a background on 
in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping sections 
 and discuss extensions and protocol details of these 
techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing section presents 
simulation results showcasing the benefits of guess and 
section presents a discussion and some directions for 
future work 
 motivation 
to estimate the scale of the problem in-stat predicts that 
the number of wifi-enabled devices sold annually alone will 
grow to million by therefore it would be 
reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment 
will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range 
of each other as a result distributed spectrum sensing and 
allocation would become both important and fundamental 
coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential 
due to limited device sensing resolution and physical rf 
effects such as shadowing cabric et al illustrate the gains 
from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction 
in the probability of interference with the primary user when 
only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate 
however such coordination is non-trivial due to the 
limited bandwidth available for coordination the need to 
communicate this information on short timescales and 
the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged 
limited bandwidth due to restrictions of cost and 
power most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware 
for supporting coordination this implies that both data 
and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a 
single radio interface therefore any time spent 
communicating sensory information takes away from the device s 
ability to perform its intended function thus any such 
coordination must incur minimal network overhead 
short timescales further compounding the problem 
is the need to immediately propagate updated rf sensory 
data in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely 
fashion this is especially true due to mobility as rapid changes 
of the rf environment can occur due to device and obstacle 
movements here fading and multi-path interference 
heavily impact sensing abilities signal level can drop to a deep 
null with just a λ movement in receiver position cm 
at ghz where λ is the wavelength coordination 
which does not support rapid dissemination of information 
will not be able to account for such rf variations 
large sensory data because cognitive radios can 
potentially use any part of the rf spectrum there will be 
numerous channels that they need to scan suppose we wish to 
compute the average signal energy in each of discretized 
frequency bands and each signal can have up to discrete 
energy levels exchanging complete sensory information 
between nodes would require bits per transmission for 
 channels each requiring seven bits of information 
exchanging this information among even a small group of 
devices each second would require time-steps × 
devices × bits per transmission mbps of aggregate 
network bandwidth 
contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to 
disseminate such information and the use of fm bit vectors 
to perform in-network aggregation by applying gossip and 
fm aggregation aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to 
 c·logn time-steps × devices × bits per transmission 
 mbps since time-steps are needed to propagate 
the data with c for illustrative purpoes 
 this is 
explained further in section 
based on these insights we propose guess a low-overhead 
approach which uses incremental extensions to fm 
aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination 
within a cognitive radio network as we show in section 
 
convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology 
of the devices which in turn depends on the environment

requirements by up to a factor of over the standard 
approaches discussed above 
 related work 
research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly 
over the years and it is being projected as one of the leading 
enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future 
as mentioned earlier the fcc has already identified new 
regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and 
secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed 
in the literature to support such sharing 
detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial 
especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive 
radio aware secondary users must be able to detect the 
primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals this 
has been shown by sahai et al to be extremely 
difficult even if the modulation scheme is known sophisticated 
and costly hardware beyond a simple energy detector is 
required to improve signal detection accuracy moreover 
a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect 
signals from the primary as a result simple local 
sensing approaches have not gained much momentum this has 
motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios 
 
more recently some researchers have proposed approaches 
for radio coordination liu et al consider a centralized 
access point or base station architecture in which 
sensing information is forwarded to aps for spectrum allocation 
purposes aps direct mobile clients to collect such 
sensing information on their behalf however due to the need 
of a fixed ap infrastructure such a centralized approach is 
clearly not scalable 
in other work zhao et al propose a distributed 
coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation 
cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination 
occurs within clusters the corvus architecture proposes 
a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized 
or decentralized approach to manage clusters although an 
improvement over purely centralized approaches these 
techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters 
which not only adds additional delay but also requires many 
of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static in 
contrast guess does not place such restrictions on secondary 
users and can even function in highly mobile environments 
 background 
this section provides the background for our approach 
we present the fm aggregation scheme that we use to 
generate spectrum summaries and perform in-network 
aggregation we also discuss randomized gossiping techniques for 
disseminating aggregates in a cognitive radio network 
 fm aggregation 
aggregation is the process where nodes in a distributed 
network combine data received from neighboring nodes with 
their local value to generate a combined aggregate this 
aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the 
network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all 
nodes has converged to the same value i e the global 
aggregate double-counting is a well known problem in this 
process where nodes may contribute more than once to the 
aggregate causing inaccuracy in the final result intuitively 
nodes can tag the aggregate value they transmit with 
information about which nodes have contributed to it however 
this approach is not scalable order and duplicate 
insensitive odi techniques have been proposed in the literature 
 we adopt the odi approach pioneered by flajolet 
and martin fm for the purposes of aggregation next we 
outline the fm approach for full details see 
suppose we want to compute the number of nodes in the 
network i e the count query to do so each node 
performs a coin toss experiment as follows toss an unbiased 
coin stopping after the first head is seen the node then 
sets the ith bit in a bit vector initially filled with zeros 
where i is the number of coin tosses it performed the 
intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss 
experiments increases the probability of a more significant bit 
being set in one of the nodes bit vectors increases 
these bit vectors are then exchanged among nodes when 
a node receives a bit vector it updates its local bit vector 
by bitwise or-ing it with the received vector as shown in 
figure which computes average at the end of the 
aggregation process every node with high probability has 
the same bit vector the actual value of the count aggregate 
is then computed using the following formula aggf m 
 j− 
 where j represents the bit position of the least 
significant zero in the aggregate bit vector 
although such aggregates are very compact in nature 
requiring only o logn state space where n is the number 
of nodes they may not be very accurate as they can only 
approximate values to the closest power of potentially 
causing errors of up to more accurate aggregates can 
be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each 
node as explained in this decreases the error to within 
o 
√ 
m where m is the number of such bit vectors 
queries other than count can also be computed using 
variants of this basic counting algorithm as discussed in and 
shown in figure transmitting fm bit vectors between 
nodes is done using randomized gossiping discussed next 
 gossip protocols 
gossip-based protocols operate in discrete time-steps a 
time-step is the required amount of time for all 
transmissions in that time-step to complete at every time-step each 
node having something to send randomly selects one or more 
neighboring nodes and transmits its data to them the 
randomized propagation of information provides fault-tolerance 
and resilience to network failures and outages we 
emphasize that this characteristic of the protocol also allows it to 
operate without relying on any underlying network 
structure gossip protocols have been shown to provide 
exponentially fast convergence 
 on the order of o log n 
 where n is the number of nodes or radios these 
protocols can therefore easily scale to very dense 
environments 
 
convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most 
up-to-date view of the network 
 
two types of gossip protocols are 
 uniform gossip in uniform gossip at each 
timestep each node chooses a random neighbor and sends 
its data to it this process repeats for o log n steps 
 where n is the number of nodes in the network 
uniform gossip provides exponentially fast convergence 
with low network overhead 
 random walk in random walk only a subset of 
the nodes termed designated nodes communicate in a 
particular time-step at startup k nodes are randomly 
elected as designated nodes in each time-step each 
designated node sends its data to a random neighbor 
which becomes designated for the subsequent 
timestep much like passing a token this process repeats 
until the aggregate has converged in the network 
random walk has been shown to provide similar 
convergence bounds as uniform gossip in problems of similar 
context 
 incremental protocols 
 incremental fm aggregates 
one limitation of fm aggregation is that it does not 
support updates due to the probabilistic nature of fm once 
bit vectors have been ored together information cannot 
simply be removed from them as each node s contribution 
has not been recorded we propose the use of delete vectors 
an extension of fm to support updates we maintain a 
separate aggregate delete vector whose value is subtracted from 
the original aggregate vector s value to obtain the resulting 
value as follows 
agginc a− 
 − b− 
 
here a and b represent the bit positions of the least 
significant zero in the original and delete bit vectors respectively 
suppose we wish to compute the average signal level 
detected in a particular frequency to compute this we 
compute the sum of all signal level measurements and divide 
that by the count of the number of measurements a 
sum aggregate is computed similar to count explained 
in section except that each node performs s coin toss 
experiments where s is the locally measured signal level 
figure illustrates the sequence by which the average signal 
energy is computed in a particular band using fm 
aggregation 
now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes 
from s to s the vectors are updated as follows 
 s s we simply perform s − s more coin toss 
experiments and bitwise or the result with the original 
bit vector 
 s s we increase the value of the delete vector by 
performing s − s coin toss experiments and bitwise 
or the result with the current delete vector 
using delete vectors we can now support updates to the 
measured signal level with the original implementation of 
fm the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one 
recomputed every time an update occurred thus delete 
vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications 
whose data changes incrementally such as signal level 
measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment 
next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated 
between devices using incremental routing protocols 
 incremental routing protocol 
we use the following incremental variants of the routing 
protocols presented in section to support incremental 
updates to previously computed aggregates 
update received or 
local update occurs

figure state diagram each device passes through as 
updates proceed in the system 
 incremental gossip protocol igp when an 
update occurs the updated node initiates the gossiping 
procedure other nodes only begin gossiping once they 
receive the update therefore nodes receiving the 
update become active and continue communicating with 
their neighbors until the update protocol terminates 
after o log n time steps 
 incremental random walk protocol irwp 
when an update or updates occur in the system 
instead of starting random walks at k random nodes in 
the network all k random walks are initiated from the 
updated node s the rest of the protocol proceeds in 
the same fashion as the standard random walk 
protocol the allocation of walks to updates is discussed 
in more detail in where the authors show that the 
number of walks has an almost negligible impact on 
network overhead 
 protocol details 
using incremental routing protocols to disseminate 
incremental fm aggregates is a natural fit for the problem of 
coordinated spectrum sensing here we outline the 
implementation of such techniques for a cognitive radio network 
we continue with the example from section where we 
wish to perform coordination between a group of wireless 
devices to compute the average signal level in a particular 
frequency band 
using either incremental random walk or incremental 
gossip each device proceeds through three phases in order to 
determine the global average signal level for a particular 
frequency band figure shows a state diagram of these 
phases 
susceptible each device starts in the susceptible state 
and becomes infectious only when its locally measured signal 
level changes or if it receives an update message from a 
neighboring device if a local change is observed the device 
updates either the original or delete bit vector as described 
in section and moves into the infectious state if it 
receives an update message it ors the received original 
and delete bit vectors with its local bit vectors and moves 
into the infectious state 
note because signal level measurements may change 
sporadically over time a smoothing function such as an 
exponentially weighted moving average should be applied to 
these measurements 
infectious once a device is infectious it continues to 
send its up-to-date bit vectors using either incremental 
random walk or incremental gossip to neighboring nodes due 
to fm s order and duplicate insensitive odi properties 
simultaneously occurring updates are handled seamlessly by 
the protocol 
update messages contain a time stamp indicating when 
the update was generated and each device maintains a

using this information a device moves into the recovered

happens after o log n time steps 
recovered a recovered device ceases to propagate any 
update information at this point it performs clean-up and 
prepares for the next infection by entering the susceptible 
state once all devices have entered the recovered state the 
system will have converged and with high probability all 
devices will have the up-to-date average signal level due 
to the cumulative nature of fm even if all devices have not 
converged the next update will include all previous updates 
nevertheless the probability that gossip fails to converge is 
small and has been shown to be o n 
for coordinated spectrum sensing non-incremental 
routing protocols can be implemented in a similar fashion 
random walk would operate by having devices periodically drop 
the aggregate and re-run the protocol each device would 
perform a coin toss biased on the number of walks to 
determine whether or not it is a designated node this is 
different from the protocol discussed above where only 
updated nodes initiate random walks similar techniques can 
be used to implement standard gossip 
 evaluation 
we now provide a preliminary evaluation of guess in 
simulation a more detailed evaluation of this approach can 
be found in here we focus on how incremental 
extensions to gossip protocols can lead to further improvements 
over standard gossiping techniques for the problem of 
coordinated spectrum sensing 
simulation setup we implemented a custom 
simulator in c we study the improvements of our 
incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two 
dimensions execution time and network overhead we use two 
topologies to represent device connectivity a clique to 
eliminate the effects of the underlying topology on protocol 
performance and a brite-generated power-law random 
graph plrg to illustrate how our results extend to more 
realistic scenarios we simulate a large deployment of 
devices to analyze protocol scalability 
in our simulations we compute the average signal level in 
a particular band by disseminating fm bit vectors in each 
run of the simulation we induce a change in the measured 
signal at one or more devices a run ends when the new 
average signal level has converged in the network 
for each data point we ran simulations and 
confidence intervals error bars are shown 
simulation parameters each transmission involves 
sending bits of information to a neighboring node to 
compute the average aggregate four bit vectors need to 
be transmitted the original sum vector the sum delete 
vector the original count vector and the count delete 
vector non-incremental protocols do not transmit the delete 
vectors each transmission also includes a time stamp of 
when the update was generated 
we assume nodes communicate on a common control 
channel at mbps therefore one time-step of protocol 
execution corresponds to the time required for nodes to 
sequentially send bits at mbps sequential use of the 
control channel is a worst case for our protocols in practice 
multiple control channels could be used in parallel to reduce 
execution time we also assume nodes are loosely time 
synchronized the implications of which are discussed further in 
 finally in order to isolate the effect of protocol 
operation on performance we do not model the complexities of 
the wireless channel in our simulations 
incremental protocols reduce execution time 
figure a compares the performance of incremental gossip 
 igp with uniform gossip on a clique topology we observe 
that both protocols have almost identical execution times 
this is expected as igp operates in a similar fashion to 
 
uniform gossip taking o log n time-steps to converge 
figure b compares the execution times of 
incremental random walk irwp and standard random walk on a 
clique irwp reduces execution time by a factor of for a 
small number of measured signal changes although random 
walk and irwp both use k random walks in our simulations 
k number of nodes irwp initiates walks only from 
updated nodes as explained in section resulting in faster 
information convergence these improvements carry over to 
a plrg topology as well as shown in figure c where 
irwp is times faster than random walk 
incremental protocols reduce network overhead 
figure a shows the ratio of data transmitted using 
uniform gossip relative to incremental gossip on a clique for 
a small number of signal changes incremental gossip incurs 
 times less overhead than uniform gossip this is because 
in the early steps of protocol execution only devices which 
detect signal changes communicate as more signal changes 
are introduced into the system gossip and incremental 
gossip incur approximately the same overhead 
similarly incremental random walk irwp incurs much 
less overhead than standard random walk figure b shows 
a fold reduction in overhead for small numbers of 
signal changes on a clique although each protocol uses the 
same number of random walks irwp uses fewer network 
resources than random walk because it takes less time to 
converge this improvement also holds true on more 
complex plrg topologies as shown in figure c where we 
observe a reduction in network overhead 
from these results it is clear that incremental techniques 
yield significant improvements over standard approaches to 
gossip even on complex topologies because spectrum 
utilization is characterized by incremental changes to usage 
incremental protocols are ideally suited to solve this 
problem in an efficient and cost effective manner 
 discussion and future work 
we have only just scratched the surface in addressing the 
problem of coordinated spectrum sensing using incremental 
gossiping next we outline some open areas of research 
spatial decay devices performing coordinated sensing 
are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local 
neighborhood therefore we recommend the use of 
spatially decaying aggregates which limits the impact of an 
update on more distant nodes spatially decaying 
aggregates work by successively reducing by means of a decay 
function the value of the update as it propagates further 
from its origin one challenge with this approach is that 
propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time 
and more importantly exhibits spatio-temporal variations 
therefore finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial 
and an interesting subject of future work 
significance threshold rf spectrum bands 
continually experience small-scale changes which may not 
necessarily be significant deciding if a change is significant can be 
done using a significance threshold β below which any 
observed change is not propagated by the node choosing an 
appropriate operating value for β is application dependent 
and explored further in 
weighted readings although we argued that most 
devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing 
equipment there may be situations where there are some special 
infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than 
others weighting their measurements more heavily could 
be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy 
determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research 
implementation specifics finally implementing 
gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open if 
implemented at the mac layer it may be feasible to piggy-back 
gossip messages over existing management frames e g 
networking advertisement messages as well we also require 
the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing 
information there are a variety of alternatives for 
implementing such a channel some of which are outlined in the 
trade-offs of different approaches to implementing guess 
is a subject of future work 
 conclusion 
spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic 
spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks the nature of 
the rf environment necessitates coordination between 
cognitive radio devices we propose guess an approximate 
yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination 
between cognitive radios the fundamental contributions of 
guess are an fm aggregation scheme for efficient 
innetwork aggregation a randomized gossiping approach 
which provides exponentially fast convergence and 
robustness to network alterations and incremental variations 
of fm and gossip which we show can reduce the 
communication time by up to a factor of and reduce network 
overhead by up to a factor of our preliminary 
simulation results showcase the benefits of this approach and we 
also outline a set of open problems that make this a new 
and exciting area of research
