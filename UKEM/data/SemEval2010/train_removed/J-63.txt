abstract 
this paper introduces a new class of mechanisms based on 
negotiation between market participants this model allows 
us to circumvent myerson and satterthwaite s impossibility 
result and present a bilateral market mechanism that is 
efficient individually rational incentive compatible and 
budget balanced in the single-unit heterogeneous setting the 
underlying scheme makes this combination of desirable 
qualities possible by reporting a price range for each buyer-seller 
pair that defines a zone of possible agreements while the 
final price is left open for negotiation

 introduction 
in this paper we introduce the concept of negotiation 
based mechanisms in the context of the theory of efficient 
truthful markets a market consists of multiple buyers and 
sellers who wish to exchange goods the market s main 
objective is to produce an allocation of sellers goods to buyers 
as to maximize the total gain from trade 
a commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken 
from the field of economic mechanism design in 
this model each player has a private valuation function that 
assigns real values to each possible allocation the 
algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing 
payments to them 
the mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and 
seller bids and clears the exchange by computing i a set of 
trades and ii the payments made and received by players 
in designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments 
we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested 
players i e rational players that follow expected-utility 
maximizing strategies we set allocative efficiency as our 
primary goal that is the mechanism must compute a set 
of trades that maximizes gain from trade in addition we 
require individual rationality ir so that all players have 
positive expected utility to participate budget balance bb 
so that the exchange does not run at a loss and incentive 
compatibility ic so that reporting the truth is a dominant 
strategy for each player 
unfortunately myerson and satterthwaite s well 
known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is 
impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency bb and 
ir using an ic mechanism a unique approach to 
overcome myerson and satterthwaite s impossibility result was 
attempted by parkes kalagnanam and eso this result 
designs both a regular and a combinatorial bilateral trade 
mechanism which imposes bb and ir that approximates 
truth revelation and allocation efficiency 
in this paper we circumvent myerson and satterthwaite s 
impossibility result by introducing a new model of 
negotiationrange markets a negotiation-range mechanism does not 
produce payment prices for the market participants rather 
is assigns each buyer-seller pair a price range called zone 
of possible agreements zopa the buyer is provided with 
the high end of the range and the seller with the low end 
of the range this allows the trading parties to engage in 
negotiation over the final price with guarantee that the deal 
is beneficial for both of them the negotiation process is not 
considered part of the mechanism but left up to the 
interested parties or to some external mechanism to perform in 
effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator 
between the market participants offering them the grounds 
to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves 
this concept is natural to many real-world market 
environments such as the real estate market 
 
we focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting n 
sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids 
specifying their willingness to sell and m buyers interested in 
buying a single good each placing sealed bids specifying 
their willingness to pay for each good they may be 
interested in 
our main result is a single-unit heterogeneous bilateral 
trade negotiation-range mechanism zopas that is 
efficient individually rational incentive compatible and budget 
balanced 
our result does not contradict myerson and 
satterthwaite s important theorem myerson-satterthwaite s proof 
relies on a theorem assuring that in two different efficient 
ic markets if the sellers have the same upper bound utility 
then they will receive the same prices in each market and 
if the buyers have the same lower bound utility then they 
will receive the same prices in each market our single-unit 
heterogeneous mechanism bypasses myerson and 
satterthwaite s theorem by producing a price range defined by a 
seller s floor and a buyer s ceiling for each pair of matched 
players in our market mechanism the seller s upper bound 
utility may be the same while the seller s floor is different 
and the buyer s lower bound utility may be the same while 
the buyer s ceiling is different moreover the final price is 
not fixed by the mechanism at all instead it is determined 
by an independent negotiation between the buyer and seller 
more specifically in a negotiation-range mechanism the 
range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a 
negotiation stage where a final price is determined this 
negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be ic 
intuitively a negotiation range mechanism is incentive 
compatible if truth telling promises the best zopa from the 
point of view of the player in question that is he would 
tell the truth if this strategy maximizes the upper and lower 
bounds on his utility as expressed by the zopa boundaries 
yet when carefully examined it turns out that it is 
impossible by that this goal will always hold this is simply 
because such a mechanism could be easily modified to 
determine final prices for the players e g by taking the average of 
the range s boundaries here the negotiation stage come 
into play we show that if the above utility maximizing 
condition does not hold then it is the case that the player 
cannot influence the negotiation bound that is assigned to 
his deal partner no matter what value he declares this 
means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting 
a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound 
something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting 
his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the 
modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy this 
eliminates the benefit of reporting false valuations and 
allows our mechanism to compute the optimal gain from trade 
according to the players true values 
the problem of computing the optimal allocation which 
maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the 
problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a 
weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers where 
each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the 
difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid it 
is well known that this problem can be solved efficiently in 
polynomial time 
vcg ic payment schemes support efficient and 
ir bilateral trade but not simultaneously bb our particular 
approach adapts the vcg payment scheme to achieve 
budget balance the philosophy of the vcg payment schemes 
in bilateral trade is that the buyer pays the seller s 
opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not 
keeping the good to herself the seller is paid in addition to 
the buyer s price a compensation for the damage the 
mechanism did to the seller by not extracting the buyer s full 
bid our philosophy is a bit different the seller is paid at 
least her opportunity cost of not selling the good to another 
buyer and not keeping the good for herself the buyer pays 
at most his alternate seller s opportunity cost of not selling 
the good to another buyer and not keeping the alternate 
good for herself 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows in 
section we describe our model and definitions in section 
we present the single-unit heterogeneous negotiation-range 
mechanism and show that it is efficient ir ic and bb 
finally we conclude with a discussion in section 
 negotiation markets 
preliminaries 
let π denote the set of players n the set of n 
selling players and m the set of m buying players where 
π n ∪ m let ψ t denote the set of goods 
let ti ∈ − t 
denote an exchange vector for a trade 
such that player i buys goods a ∈ ψ ti a and sells 
goods a ∈ ψ ti a − let t t t π denote 
the complete trade between all players we view t as 
describing the allocation of goods by the mechanism to the 
buyers and sellers 
in the single-unit heterogeneous setting every good 
belongs to specific seller and every buyer is interested in 
buying one good the buyer may bid for several or all goods 
at the end of the auction every good is either assigned to 
one of the buyers who bid for it or kept unsold by the seller 
it is convenient to assume the sets of buyers and sellers are 
disjoint though it is not required i e n ∩ m ∅ each 
seller i is associated with exactly one good ai for which she 
has true valuation ci which expresses the price at which it 
is beneficial for her to sell the good if the seller reports a 
false valuation at an attempt to improve the auction results 
for her this valuation is denoted ˆci a buyer has a 
valuation vector describing his valuation for each of the goods 
according to their owner specifically vj k denotes buyer 
j s valuation for good ak similarly if he reports a false 
valuation it is denoted ˆvj k 
if buyer j is matched by the mechanism with seller i then 
ti ai − and tj ai notice that in our setting for 
every k i ti ak and tj ai and also for every 
z j tz ai 
for a matched buyer j - seller i pair the gain from trade 
on the deal is defined as vj i − ci given and allocation t 
the gain from trade associated with t is 
v 
j∈m i∈n 
 vj i − ci · tj ai 
let t 
denote the optimal allocation which maximizes the 
gain from trade computed according to the players true 
valuations let v 
denote the optimal gain from trade 
associated with this allocation 
when players report false valuations we use ˆt 
and ˆv 
to 
denote the optimal allocation and gain from trade 
respectively when computed according to the reported valuations 
 
we are interested in the design of negotiation-range 
mechanisms in contrast to a standard auction mechanism where 
the buyer and seller are provided with the prices they should 
pay the goal of a negotiation-range mechanism is to provide 
the player s with a range of prices within which they can 
negotiate the final terms of the deal by themselves the 
mechanism would provide the buyer with the upper bound 
on the range and the seller with the lower bound on the 
range this gives each of them a promise that it will be 
beneficial for them to close the deal but does not provide 
information about the other player s terms of negotiation 
definition negotiation range zone of possible 
agreements zopa between a matched buyer and seller the 
zopa is a range l h ≤ l ≤ h where h is an upper 
bound ceiling price for the buyer and l is a lower bound 
 floor price for the seller 
definition negotiation-range mechanism a 
mechanism that computes a zopa l h for each matched buyer 
and seller in t 
 and provides the buyer with the upper bound 
h and the seller with the lower bound l 
the basic assumption is that participants in the auction 
are self-interested players that is their main goal is to 
maximize their expected utility the utility for a buyer who 
does not participate in the trade is if he does win some 
good his utility is the surplus between his valuation for that 
good and the price he pays for a seller if she keeps the good 
unsold her utility is just her valuation of the good and the 
surplus is if she gets to sell it her utility is the price she 
is paid for it and the surplus is the difference between this 
price and her valuation 
since negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the 
range of prices rather than the final price it is useful to 
define the upper and lower bounds on the player s utilities 
defined by the range s limits 
definition consider a buyer j - seller i pair matched 
by a negotiation-range mechanism and let l h be their 
associated negotiation range 
 the buyer s top utility is vj i − l and the buyer s 
bottom utility is vj i − h 
 the seller s top utility is h with surplus h − ci and 
the seller s bottom utility is l with surplus l − ci 
 the single-unit heterogeneous 
mechanism zopas 
 description of the mechanism 
zopas is a negotiation-range mechanism it finds the 
optimal allocation t 
and uses it to define a zopa for each 
buyer-seller pair 
the first stage in applying the mechanism is for the buyers 
and sellers to submit their sealed bids the mechanism then 
allocates buyers to sellers by computing the allocation t 
 
which results in the optimal gain from trade v 
 and defines 
a zopa for each buyer-seller pair finally buyers and sellers 
use the zopa to negotiate a final price 
computing t

bipartite matching problem for the complete bipartite graph

for every buyer j 
and every seller i of good ai 
report to seller i her floor li 
and identify her matched buyer j 
report to buyer j his ceiling hj 
and identify his matched seller i 
i j negotiate the good s final price 
figure the zopas mechanism 
graph the seller on another and giving the edge between 
buyer j and seller i weight equal to vj i − ci the 
maximum weighted matching problem in solvable in polynomial 
time e g using the hungarian method this results in 
a matching between buyers and sellers that maximizes gain 
from trade 
the next step is to compute for each buyer-seller pair a 
seller s floor which provides the lower bound of the zopa 
for this pair and assigns it to the seller 
a seller s floor is computed by calculating the difference 
between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded 
and the total gain from trade of the other participants when 
the buyer is included the vcg principle 
let t−j 
denote the gain from trade of the optimal 
allocation when buyer j s bids are discarded denote by v−j 
the total gain from trade in the allocation t−j 
 
definition seller floor the lowest price the seller 
should expect to receive communicated to the seller by the 
mechanism the seller floor for player i who was matched 
with buyer j on good ai i e tj ai is computed as 
li vj i v−j 
− v 
 
the seller is instructed not to accept less than this price from 
her matched buyer 
next the mechanism computes for each buyer-seller pair a 
buyer ceiling which provides the upper bound of the zopa 
for this pair and assigns it to the buyer 
each buyer s ceiling is computed by removing the buyer s 
matched seller and calculating the difference between the 
total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the 
total gain from trade of the other participants when the 
 
buyer is included let t−i 
 
denote the gain from trade 
of the optimal allocation when seller i is removed from the 
trade denote by v −i 
 
the total gain from trade in the 
allocation t−i 
 
 
let t−i 
−j 
denote the gain from trade of the optimal 
allocation when seller i is removed from the trade and buyer j s 
bids are discarded denote by v −i 
−j 
the total gain from 
trade in the allocation t −i 
−j 
 
definition buyer ceiling the highest price the seller 
should expect to pay communicated to the buyer by the 
mechanism the buyer ceiling for player j who was matched with 
seller i on good ai i e tj ai is computed as 
hj vj i v −i 
−j 
− v −i 
 
 
the buyer is instructed not to pay more than this price to 
his matched seller 
once the negotiation range lower bound and upper bound 
are computed for every matched pair the mechanism reports 
the lower bound price to the seller and the upper bound price 
to the buyer at this point each buyer-seller pair negotiates 
on the final price and concludes the deal 
a schematic description the zopas mechanism is given 
in figure 
 analysis of the mechanism 
in this section we analyze the properties of the zopas 
mechanism 
theorem the zopas market negotiation-range 
mechanism is an incentive-compatible bilateral trade 
mechanism that is efficient individually rational and budget 
balanced 
clearly zopas is an efficient polynomial time mechanism 
let us show it satisfies the rest of the properties in the 
theorem 
claim zopas is individually rational i e the 
mechanism maintains nonnegative utility surplus for all 
participants 
proof if a participant does not trade in the optimal 
allocation then his utility surplus is zero by definition 
consider a pair of buyer j and seller i which are matched in the 
optimal allocation t 
 then the buyer s utility is at least 
vj i − hj recall that hj vj i v −i 
−j 
− v −i 
 
 so 
that vj i − hj v −i 
 
− v −i 
−j 
 since the optimal gain 
from trade which includes j is higher than that which does 
not we have that the utility is nonnegative vj i − hj ≥ 
now consider the seller i her utility surplus is at least 
li − ci recall that li vj i v−j 
− v 
 if we 
removed from the optimal allocation t 
the contribution of 
the buyer j - seller i pair we are left with an allocation 
which excludes j and has value v 
− vj i − ci this 
implies that v−j 
≥ v 
− vj i ci which implies that 
li − ci ≥ 
the fact that zopas is a budget-balanced mechanism 
follows from the following lemma which ensures the validity 
of the negotiation range i e that every seller s floor is below 
her matched buyer s ceiling this ensures that they can close 
the deal at a final price which lies in this range 
lemma for every buyer j- seller i pair matched by the 
mechanism li ≤ hj 
proof recall that li vj i v−j 
− v 
and hj 
vj i v −i 
−j 
− v −i 
 
 to prove that li ≤ hj it is enough 
to show that 
 v −i 
 
 v−j 
≤ v 
 v −i 
−j 
 
the proof of is based on a method which we apply 
several times in our analysis we start with the 
allocations t−i 
 
and t−j 
which together have value equal 
to v −i 
 
 v−j 
 we now use them to create a pair of 
new valid allocations by using the same pairs that were 
matched in the original allocations this means that the 
sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the 
original pair of allocations we also require that one of the new 
allocations does not include buyer j or seller i this means 
that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most 
v 
 v −i 
−j 
 which proves 
let g be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side 
of g represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side 
represent the sellers and edge weights represent the gain 
from trade for the particular pair the different allocations 
represent bipartite matchings in g it will be convenient for 
the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong 
to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific 
color representing this matching 
assign color to the edges in the matching t −i 
 
and 
assign color to the edges in the matching t−j 
 we claim 
that these edges can be recolored using colors and so that 
the new coloring represents allocations t represented by 
color and t−i 
−j represented by color this implies 
the that inequality holds figure illustrates the graph 
g and the colorings of the different matchings 
define an alternating path p starting at j let s be 
the seller matched to j in t −i 
 
 if none exists then p is 
empty let b be the buyer matched to s in t−j 
 s be 
the seller matched to b in t−i 
 
 b be the buyer matched 
to s in t−j 
 and so on this defines an alternating 
path p starting at j whose edges colors alternate between 
colors and starting with this path ends either in a 
seller who is not matched in t−j 
or in a buyer who is not 
matched in t−i 
 
 since all sellers in this path are matched 
in t−i 
 
 we have that seller i does not belong to p this 
ensures that edges in p may be colored by alternating colors 
 and starting with since except for the first edge all 
others do not involve i or j and thus may be colored and 
be part of an allocation t −i 
−j 
we are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to p 
since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges 
that were colored which are part of t −i 
 
 may now be 
colored and be included in the allocation t −i 
−j it is 
also clear that the edges that were colored which are part 
of t−j 
 may now be colored and be included in the 
allocation t this completes the proof of the lemma 
 incentive compatibility 
the basic requirement in mechanism design is for an 
exchange mechanism to be incentive compatible this means 
that its payment structure enforces that truth-telling is the 
players weakly dominant strategy that is that the 
strategy by which the player is stating his true valuation results

figure key to figure 
in bigger or equal utility as any other strategy the 
utility surplus is defined as the absolute difference between the 
player s bid and his price 
negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range 
of prices rather than the final price and therefore the player s 
valuation only influences the minimum and maximum bounds 
on his utility for a buyer the minimum bottom utility 
would be based on the top of the negotiation range 
 ceiling and the maximum top utility would be based on the 
bottom of the negotiation range floor for a seller it s the 
other way around therefore the basic natural requirement 
from negotiation-range mechanisms would be that stating 
the player s true valuation results in both the higher 
bottom utility and higher top utility for the player compared 
with other strategies unfortunately this requirement is 
still too strong and it is impossible by that this will 
always hold therefore we slightly relax it as follows we 
require this holds when the false valuation based strategy 
changes the player s allocation when the allocation stays 
unchanged we require instead that the player would not be 
able to change his matched player s bound e g a buyer 
cannot change the seller s floor this means that the only 
thing he can influence is his own bound something that he 
can alternatively achieve through means of negotiation 
the following formally summarizes our incentive 
compatibility requirements from the negotiation-range mechanism 
buyer s incentive compatibility 
 let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the 
mechanism according to valuation vj and the 
negotiationrange assigned is li hj assume that when the 
mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj seller 
k i is matched with j and the negotiation-range 
assigned is ˆlk ˆhj then 
vj i − hj ≥ vj k − ˆhj 
vj i − li ≥ vj k − ˆlk 
 let j be a buyer not matched by the mechanism 
according to valuation vj assume that when the 
mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj seller k i 
is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned 
is ˆlk ˆhj then 
vj k − ˆhj ≤ vj k − ˆlk ≤ 
 let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the 
mechanism according to valuation vj and let the assigned 
bottom of the negotiation range seller s floor be li 
assume that when the mechanism is applied according 
to valuation ˆvj the matching between i and j remains 
unchanged and let the assigned bottom of the 
negotiation range seller s floor be ˆli then 
ˆli li 
notice that the first inequality of always holds for a valid 
negotiation range mechanism lemma 
seller s incentive compatibility 
 let i be a seller not matched by the mechanism 
according to valuation ci assume that when the mechanism 
 
is applied according to valuation ˆci buyer z j is 
matched with i and the negotiation-range assigned is 
 ˆli ˆhz then 
ˆli − ci ≤ ˆhz − ci ≤ 
 let i be a buyer matched with buyer j by the 
mechanism according to valuation ci and let the assigned top 
of the negotiation range buyer s ceiling be hj 
assume that when the mechanism is applied according 
to valuation ˆci the matching between i and j remains 
unchanged and let the assigned top of the negotiation 
range buyer s ceiling be ˆhj then 
ˆhj hj 
notice that the first inequality of always holds for a valid 
negotiation range mechanism lemma 
observe that in the case of sellers in our setting the case 
expressed by requirement is the only case in which the 
seller may change the allocation to her benefit in particular 
it is not possible for seller i who is matched in t 
to change 
her buyer by reporting a false valuation this fact simply 
follows from the observation that reducing the seller s 
valuation increases the gain from trade for the current allocation 
by at least as much than any other allocation whereas 
increasing the seller s valuation decreases the gain from trade 
for the current allocation by exactly the same amount as any 
other allocation in which it is matched therefore the only 
case the optimal allocation may change is when in the new 
allocation i is not matched in which case her utility surplus 
is 
theorem zopas is an incentive compatible 
negotiationrange mechanism 
proof we begin with the incentive compatibility for 
buyers 
consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according 
to his true valuation v consider that j is reporting instead 
a false valuation ˆv which results in a different allocation in 
which j is matched with seller k i the following claim 
shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to 
a false declaration of his valuation cannot improve his top 
utility 
claim let j be a buyer matched to seller i in t 
 and 
let k i be the seller matched to j in ˆt 
 then 
vj i − hj ≥ vj k − ˆhj 
proof recall that hj vj i v −i 
−j 
− v −i 
 
and 
ˆhj ˆvj k ˆv −k 
−j 
− ˆv −k 
 
 therefore vj i − hj 
 v −i 
 
− v −i 
−j 
and vj k − ˆhj vj k − ˆvj k ˆv −k 
 
− 
 ˆv −k 
−j 
 
it follows that in order to prove we need to show 
 ˆv −k 
 
 v −i 
−j 
≤ v −i 
 
 ˆv −k 
−j 
 ˆvj k − vj k 
consider first the case were j is matched to i in ˆt−k 
 
 if 
we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain 
a matching which excludes i if the gain from trade on the 
new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we 
get 
 ˆv −k 
 
− ˆvj i − ci vj k − ck ≤ v −i 
 
 
now since the optimal allocation ˆt 
matches j with k rather 
than with i we have that 
 v −i 
−j 
 ˆvj i − ci ≤ ˆv 
 ˆv −k 
−j 
 ˆvj k − ck 
where we have used that ˆv −i 
−j 
 v −i 
−j 
since these 
allocations exclude j adding up these two inequalities implies 
 in this case 
it is left to prove when j is not matched to i in ˆt−k 
 
 
in fact in this case we prove the stronger inequality 
 ˆv −k 
 
 v −i 
−j 
≤ v −i 
 
 ˆv −k 
−j 
 
it is easy to see that indeed implies since it follows 
from the fact that k is assigned to j in ˆt 
that ˆvj k ≥ 
vj k the proof of works as follows we start with the 
allocations ˆt−k 
 
and t−i 
−j 
which together have value 
equal to ˆv −k 
 
 v −i 
−j 
 we now use them to create a 
pair of new valid allocations by using the same pairs that 
were matched in the original allocations this means that 
the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the 
original pair of allocations we also require that one of the 
new allocations does not include seller i and is based on the 
true valuation v while the other allocation does not include 
buyer j or seller k and is based on the false valuation ˆv this 
means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at 
most v −i 
 
 ˆv −k 
−j 
 which proves 
let g be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side 
of g represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side 
represent the sellers and edge weights represent the gain 
from trade for the particular pair the different allocations 
represent bipartite matchings in g it will be convenient for 
the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong 
to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific 
color representing this matching 
assign color to the edges in the matching ˆt−k 
 
and 
assign color to the edges in the matching t −i 
−j 
 we claim 
that these edges can be recolored using colors and so that 
the new coloring represents allocations t −i 
 represented 
by color and ˆt−k 
−j represented by color this implies 
the that inequality holds figure illustrates the graph 
g and the colorings of the different matchings 
define an alternating path p starting at j let s i be 
the seller matched to j in ˆt−k 
 
 if none exists then p is 
empty let b be the buyer matched to s in t−i 
−j 
 s be 
the seller matched to b in ˆt−k 
 
 b be the buyer matched 
to s in t−i 
−j 
 and so on this defines an alternating 
path p starting at j whose edges colors alternate between 
colors and starting with this path ends either in 
a seller who is not matched in t −i 
−j 
or in a buyer who 
is not matched in ˆt−k 
 
 since all sellers in this path are 
matched in ˆt−k 
 
 we have that seller k does not belong to 
p since in this case s i and the rest of the sellers in p 
are matched in t−i 
−j 
we have that seller i as well does not 
belong to p this ensures that edges in p may be colored 
by alternating colors and starting with since s i 
we may use color for the first edge and thus assign it to 
the allocation t−i 
 all other edges do not involve i j 
or k and thus may be either colored and be part of an 
allocation ˆt−k 
−j or colored and be part of an allocation 
 t−i 
 in an alternating fashion 
we are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to p 
since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges 
 
that were colored which are part of ˆt−k 
 
 may now be 
colored and be included in the allocation ˆt−k 
−j it is 
also clear that the edges that were colored which are part 
of t−i 
−j 
 may now be colored and be included in the 
allocation t−i 
 this completes the proof of and the 
claim 
the following claim shows that a buyer j which changed 
his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation 
cannot improve his bottom utility the proof is basically the 
standard vcg argument 
claim let j be a buyer matched to seller i in t 
 and 
k i be the seller matched to j in ˆt 
 then 
vj i − li ≥ vj k − ˆlk 
proof recall that li vj i v−j 
− v 
 and ˆlk 
ˆvj k ˆv−j 
− ˆv 
 ˆvj k v−j 
− ˆv 
 therefore 
vj i − li v 
− v−j 
and vj k − ˆlk vj k − ˆvj k 
ˆv 
− v−j 
 
it follows that in order to prove we need to show 
v 
≥ vj k − ˆvj k ˆv 
 
the scenario of this claim occurs when j understates his 
value for ai or overstated his value for ak consider these 
two cases 
 ˆvj k vj k since ak was allocated to j in the 
allocation ˆt 
we have that using the allocation of ˆt 
according to the true valuation gives an allocation of 
value u satisfying ˆv 
− ˆvj k vj k ≤ u ≤ v 
 
 ˆvj k vj k and ˆvj i vj i in this case 
reduces to v 
≥ ˆv 
 since j is not allocated i in ˆt 
we have that ˆt 
is an allocation that uses only true 
valuations from the optimality of t 
we conclude 
that v 
≥ ˆv 
 
another case in which a buyer may try to improve his 
utility is when he does not win any good by stating his true 
valuation he may give a false valuation under which he 
wins some good the following claim shows that doing this 
is not beneficial to him 
claim let j be a buyer not matched in t 
 and 
assume seller k is matched to j in ˆt 
 then 
vj k − ˆlk ≤ 
proof the scenario of this claim occurs if j did not 
buy in the truth-telling allocation and overstates his value 
for ak ˆvj k vj k in his false valuation recall that 
ˆlk ˆvj k ˆv−j 
− ˆv 
 thus we need to show that 
 ≥ vj k − ˆvj k ˆv 
− v−j 
 since j is not allocated 
in t 
then v−j 
 v 
 since j is allocated ak in ˆt 
we have that using the allocation of ˆt 
according to the 
true valuation gives an allocation of value u satisfying ˆv 
− 
ˆvj k vj k ≤ u ≤ v 
 thus we can conclude that ≥ 
vj k − ˆvj k ˆv 
− v−j 
 
finally the following claim ensures that a buyer cannot 
influence the floor bound of the zopa for the good he wins 
claim let j be a buyer matched to seller i in t 
 and 
assume that ˆt 
 t 
 then ˆli li 
proof recall that li vj i v−j 
− v 
 and ˆli 
ˆvj i ˆv−j 
− ˆv 
 ˆvj i v−j 
− ˆv 
 therefore we 
need to show that ˆv 
 v 
 ˆvj i − vj i 
since j is allocated ai in t 
 we have that using the 
allocation of t 
according to the false valuation gives an allocation 
of value u satisfying v 
− vj i ˆvj i ≤ u ≤ ˆv 
 
similarly since j is allocated ai in ˆt 
 we have that using the 
allocation of ˆt 
according to the true valuation gives an 
allocation of value u satisfying ˆv 
− ˆvj i vj i ≤ u ≤ v 
 
which together with the previous inequality completes the 
proof 
this completes the analysis of the buyer s incentive 
compatibility we now turn to prove the seller s incentive 
compatibility properties of our mechanism 
the following claim handles the case where a seller that 
was not matched in t 
falsely understates her valuation such 
that she gets matched n ˆt 
 
claim let i be a seller not matched in t 
 and assume 
buyer z is matched to i in ˆt 
 then 
ˆhz − ci ≤ 
proof recall that ˆhz vz i ˆv −i 
−z 
− ˆv −i 
 
 
since i is not matched in t 
and ˆt−i 
 
involves only true 
valuations we have that ˆv −i 
 
 v 
 since i is matched 
with z in ˆt 
it can be obtained by adding the buyer z - seller 
i pair to ˆt−i 
−z 
 it follows that ˆv 
 ˆv −i 
−z 
 vz i − ˆci 
thus we have that ˆhz ˆv 
 ˆci − v 
 now since i is 
matched in ˆt 
 using this allocation according to the true 
valuation gives an allocation of value u satisfying ˆv 
 ˆci − 
ci ≤ u ≤ v 
 therefore ˆhz −ci ˆv 
 ˆci −v 
−ci ≤ 
finally the following simple claim ensures that a seller 
cannot influence the ceiling bound of the zopa for the good 
she sells 
claim let i be a seller matched to buyer j in t 
 and 
assume that ˆt 
 t 
 then ˆhj hj 
proof since ˆv −i 
−j 
 v −i 
−j 
and ˆv −i 
 
 v −i 
 
it 
follows that 
ˆhj vj i ˆv −i 
−j 
− ˆv −i 
 
 vj i v −i 
−j 
− v −i

 conclusions and extensions 
in this paper we suggest a way to deal with the 
impossibility of producing mechanisms which are efficient 
individually rational incentive compatible and budget balanced 
to this aim we introduce the concept of negotiation-range 
mechanisms which avoid the problem by leaving the final 
determination of prices to a negotiation between the buyer 
and seller the goal of the mechanism is to provide the 
initial range zopa for negotiation in a way that it will be 
beneficial for the participants to close the proposed deals 
we present a negotiation range mechanism that is efficient 
individually rational incentive compatible and budget 
balanced the zopa produced by our mechanism is based 
 
on a natural adaptation of the vcg payment scheme in a 
way that promises valid negotiation ranges which permit a 
budget balanced allocation 
the basic question that we aimed to tackle seems very 
exciting which properties can we expect a market 
mechanism to achieve are there different market models and 
requirements from the mechanisms that are more feasible 
than classic mechanism design goals 
in the context of our negotiation-range model is 
natural to further study negotiation based mechanisms in more 
general settings a natural extension is that of a 
combinatorial market unfortunately finding the optimal allocation 
in a combinatorial setting is np-hard and thus the problem 
of maintaining bb is compounded by the problem of 
maintaining ic when efficiency is approximated 
applying the approach in this paper to develop 
negotiationrange mechanisms for combinatorial markets even in 
restricted settings seems a promising direction for research
