abstract 
work on argumentation-based dialogue has defined 
frameworks within which dialogues can be carried out established 
protocols that govern dialogues and studied different 
properties of dialogues this work has established the space in 
which agents are permitted to interact through dialogues 
recently there has been increasing interest in the 
mechanisms agents might use to choose how to act - the 
rhetorical manoeuvring that they use to navigate through the space 
defined by the rules of the dialogue key in such 
considerations is the idea of relevance since a usual requirement is 
that agents stay focussed on the subject of the dialogue and 
only make relevant remarks here we study several notions 
of relevance showing how they can be related to both the 
rules for carrying out dialogues and to rhetorical 
manoeuvring

 introduction 
finding ways for agents to reach agreements in 
multiagent systems is an area of active research one mechanism 
for achieving agreement is through the use of argumentation 
- where one agent tries to convince another agent of 
something during the course of some dialogue early examples of 
argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement 
include the work of dignum et al kraus 
parsons and jennings reed schroeder et al and 
sycara 
the work of walton and krabbe popularised in the 
multiagent systems community by reed has been 
particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based 
dialogue this work influenced the field in a number of ways 
perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as 
dialogue games in the tradition of hamblin viewing 
dialogues in this way as in provides a powerful 
framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues and 
for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can 
be conducted the dialogue game view overlaps with 
work on conversation policies see for example but 
differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue 
segments 
in this paper we extend the work of by considering 
the role of relevance - the relationship between utterances 
in a dialogue relevance is a topic of increasing interest 
in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the 
scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering 
to obtain the outcomes that it requires our 
work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering 
showing when it can and cannot have an effect 
 background 
we begin by introducing the formal system of 
argumentation that underpins our approach as well as the 
corresponding terminology and notation all taken from 
a dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two 
or more members of a set of agents a an agent α maintains 
a knowledge base σα containing formulas of a propositional 
language l and having no deductive closure agent α also 
maintains the set of its past utterances called the 
commitment store csα we refer to this as an agent s public 
knowledge since it contains information that is shared with 
other agents in contrast the contents of σα are private 
to α 
note that in the description that follows we assume that 
is the classical inference relation that ≡ stands for logical 
equivalence and we use δ to denote all the information 
available to an agent thus in a dialogue between two agents 
α and β δα σα ∪ csα ∪ csβ so the commitment store 
csα can be loosely thought of as a subset of δα consisting of 
the assertions that have been made public in some dialogue 
games such as those in anything in csα is either in σα 
or can be derived from it in other dialogue games such as 
 
 - - - - rps c ifaamas 
those in csα may contain things that cannot be derived 
from σα 
definition an argument a is a pair s p where p 
is a formula of l and s a subset of δ such that i s is 
consistent ii s p and iii s is minimal so no proper 
subset of s satisfying both and exists 
s is called the support of a written s support a and p 
is the conclusion of a written p conclusion a thus we 
talk of p being supported by the argument s p 
in general since δ may be inconsistent arguments in 
a δ the set of all arguments which can be made from δ 
may conflict and we make this idea precise with the notion 
of undercutting 
definition let a and a be arguments in a δ 
a undercuts a iff ∃¬p ∈ support a such that p ≡ 
conclusion a 
in other words an argument is undercut if and only if there 
is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation 
of an element of the support for the first argument 
to capture the fact that some beliefs are more strongly 
held than others we assume that any set of beliefs has a 
preference order over it we consider all information 
available to an agent δ to be stratified into non-overlapping 
subsets δ δn such that beliefs in δi are all equally 
preferred and are preferred over elements in δj where i j 
the preference level of a nonempty subset s ⊂ δ where 
different elements s ∈ s may belong to different layers δi 
is valued at the highest numbered layer which has a member 
in s and is referred to as level s in other words s is only 
as strong as its weakest member note that the strength of 
a belief as used in this context is a separate concept from 
the notion of support discussed earlier 
definition let a and a be arguments in a δ 
a is preferred to a according to pref a 
pref 
a iff 
level support a level support a if a is 
preferred to a we say that a is stronger than a 
we can now define the argumentation system we will use 
definition an argumentation system is a triple 
a δ undercut pref 
such that 
 a δ is a set of the arguments built from δ 
 undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat 
relationship between arguments undercut ⊆ a δ × 
a δ and 
 pref is a pre-ordering on a δ × a δ 
the preference order makes it possible to distinguish 
different types of relations between arguments 
definition let a a be two arguments of a δ 
 if a undercuts a then a defends itself against a 
iff a 
pref 
a otherwise a does not defend itself 
 a set of arguments a defends a iff for every a that 
undercuts a where a does not defend itself against 
a then there is some a ∈ a such that a undercuts 
a and a does not defend itself against a 
we write aundercut pref to denote the set of all non-undercut 
arguments and arguments defending themselves against all 
their undercutting arguments the set a δ of acceptable 
arguments of the argumentation system 
a δ undercut pref 
is the least fixpoint of a function f 
a ⊆ a δ 
f a s p ∈ a δ s p is defended by a 
definition the set of acceptable arguments for an 
argumentation system a δ undercut pref is recursively 
defined as 
a δ 
 
fi≥ ∅ 
 aundercut pref ∪ 
h 
fi≥ aundercut pref 
i 
an argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable 
set and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of 
an acceptable argument 
an acceptable argument is one which is in some sense 
proven since all the arguments which might undermine it 
are themselves undermined 
definition if there is an acceptable argument for a 
proposition p then the status of p is accepted while if there 
is not an acceptable argument for p the status of p is not 
accepted 
argument a is said to affect the status of another argument 
a if changing the status of a will change the status of a 
 dialogues 
systems like those described in lay down sets of 
locutions that agents can make to put forward propositions 
and the arguments that support them and protocols that 
define precisely which locutions can be made at which points 
in the dialogue we are not concerned with such a level 
of detail here instead we are interested in the interplay 
between arguments that agents put forth as a result we 
will consider only that agents are allowed to put forward 
arguments we do not discuss the detail of the mechanism 
that is used to put these arguments forward - we just 
assume that arguments of the form s p are inserted into 
an agent s commitment store where they are then visible to 
other agents 
we then have a typical definition of a dialogue 
definition a dialogue d is a sequence of moves 
m m mn 
a given move mi is a pair α ai where ai is an argument 
that α places into its commitment store csα 
moves in an argumentation-based dialogue typically attack 
moves that have been made previously while in general 
a dialogue can include moves that undercut several 
arguments in the remainder of this paper we will only consider 
dialogues that put forward moves that undercut at most 
one argument for now we place no additional constraints 
on the moves that make up a dialogue later we will see 
how different restrictions on moves lead to different kinds of 
dialogue 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
the sequence of arguments put forward in the dialogue 
is determined by the agents who are taking part in the 
dialogue but they are usually not completely free to choose 
what arguments they make as indicated earlier their choice 
is typically limited by a protocol if we write the sequence 
of n moves m m mn as mn and denote the empty 
sequence as m then we can define a profocol in the following 
way 
definition a protocol p is a function on a sequence 
of moves mi in a dialogue d that for all i ≥ identifies 
a set of possible moves mi from which the mi th move 
may be drawn 
p mi → mi 
in other words for our purposes here at every point in 
a dialogue a protocol determines a set of possible moves 
that agents may make as part of the dialogue if a dialogue 
d always picks its moves m from the set m identified by 
protocol p then d is said to conform to p 
even if a dialogue conforms to a protocol it is typically 
the case that the agent engaging in the dialogue has to make 
a choice of move - it has to choose which of the moves in m 
to make this excercise of choice is what we refer to as an 
agent s use of rhetoric in its oratorical sense of influencing 
the thought and conduct of an audience some of our 
results will give a sense of how much scope an agent has to 
exercise rhetoric under different protocols 
as arguments are placed into commitment stores and 
hence become public agents can determine the relationships 
between them in general after several moves in a 
dialogue some arguments will undercut others we will denote 
the set of arguments a a aj asserted after moves 
m m mj of a dialogue to be aj - the relationship of 
the arguments in aj can be described as an argumentation 
graph similar to those described in for example 
definition an argumentation graph ag over a set 
of arguments a is a directed graph v e such that every 
vertex v v ∈ v denotes one argument a ∈ a every 
argument a is denoted by one vertex v and every directed edge 
e ∈ e from v to v denotes that v undercuts v 
we will use the term argument graph as a synonym for 
argumentation graph 
note that we do not require that the argumentation graph 
is connected in other words the notion of an argumentation 
graph allows for the representation of arguments that do 
not relate by undercutting or being undercut to any other 
arguments we will come back to this point very shortly 
we adapt some standard graph theoretic notions in order 
to describe various aspects of the argumentation graph if 
there is an edge e from vertex v to vertex v then v is said 
to be the parent of v and v is said to be the child of v 
in a reversal of the usual notion we define a root of an 
argumentation graph 
as follows 
definition a root of an argumentation graph ag 
 v e is a node v ∈ v that has no children 
thus a root of a graph is a node to which directed edges 
may be connected but from which no directed edges 
connect to other nodes thus a root is a node representing an 
 
note that we talk of a root rather than the root - as defined 
an argumentation graph need not be a tree 
v v 
figure an example argument graph 
argument that is undercut but which itself does no 
undercutting similarly 
definition a leaf of an argumentation graph ag 
 v e is a node v ∈ v that has no parents 
thus a leaf in an argumentation graph represents an 
argument that undercuts another argument but does no 
undercutting thus in figure v is a root and v is a leaf the 
reason for the reversal of the usual notions of root and leaf 
is that as we shall see we will consider dialogues to 
construct argumentation graphs from the roots in our sense 
to the leaves the reversal of the terminology means that it 
matches the natural process of tree construction 
since as described above argumentation graphs are 
allowed to be not connected in the usual graph theory sense 
it is helpful to distinguish nodes that are connected to other 
nodes in particular to the root of the tree we say that node 
v is connected to node v if and only if there is a path from 
v to v since edges represent undercut relations the notion 
of connectedness between nodes captures the influence that 
one argument may have on another 
proposition given an argumentation graph ag if 
there is any argument a denoted by node v that affects the 
status of another argument a denoted by v then v is 
connected to v the converse does not hold 
proof given definitions and the only ways in 
which a can affect the status of a is if a either undercuts 
a or if a undercuts some argument a that undercuts a 
or if a undercuts some a that undercuts some a that 
undercuts a and so on in all such cases a sequence of 
undercut relations relates the two arguments and if they are 
both in an argumentation graph this means that they are 
connected 
since the notion of path ignores the direction of the 
directed arcs nodes v and v are connected whether the edge 
between them runs from v to v or vice versa since a only 
undercuts a if the edge runs from v to v we cannot infer 
that a will affect the status of a from information about 
whether or not they are connected 
the reason that we need the concept of the argumentation 
graph is that the properties of the argumentation graph tell 
us something about the set of arguments a the graph 
represents when that set of arguments is constructed through a 
dialogue there is a relationship between the structure of the 
argumentation graph and the protocol that governs the 
dialogue it is the extent of the relationship between structure 
and protocol that is the main subject of this paper to study 
this relationship we need to establish a correspondence 
between a dialogue and an argumentation graph given the 
definitions we have so far this is simple 
definition a dialogue d consisting of a sequence 
of moves mn and an argument graph ag v e 
correspond to one another iff ∀m ∈ mn the argument ai that 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
is advanced at move mi is represented by exactly one node 
v ∈ v and ∀v ∈ v v represents exactly one argument ai 
that has been advanced by a move m ∈ mn 
thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if 
and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds 
to a node in the graph and every node in the graph 
corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue this 
one-toone correspondence allows us to consider each node v in the 
graph to have an index i which is the index of the move in 
the dialogue that put forward the argument which that node 
represents thus we can for example refer to the third 
node in the argumentation graph meaning the node that 
represents the argument put forward in the third move of 
the dialogue 
 relevance 
most work on dialogues is concerned with what we might 
call coherent dialogues that is dialogues in which the 
participants are as in the work of walton and krabbe 
focused on resolving some question through the dialogue 
to capture this coherence it seems we need a notion of 
relevance to constrain the statements made by agents here 
we study three notions of relevance 
definition consider a dialogue d consisting of a 
sequence of moves mi with a corresponding argument graph 
ag the move mi i is said to be relevant if one or 
more of the following hold 
r making mi will change the status of the argument 
denoted by the first node of ag 
r making mi will add a node vi that is connected to 
the first node of ag 
r making mi will add a node vi that is connected to 
the last node to be added to ag 
r -relevance is the form of relevance defined by in their 
study of strategic and tactical reasoning 
 r -relevance was 
suggested by the notion used in and though it differs 
somewhat from that suggested there we believe it captures 
the essence of its predecessor 
note that we only define relevance for the second move 
of the dialogue onwards because the first move is taken to 
identify the subject of the dialogue that is the central 
question that the dialogue is intended to answer and hence it 
must be relevant to the dialogue no matter what it is in 
assuming this we focus our attention on the same kind of 
dialogues as 
we can think of relevance as enforcing a form of 
parsimony on a dialogue - it prevents agents from making 
statements that do not bear on the current state of the dialogue 
this promotes efficiency in the sense of limiting the 
number of moves in the dialogue and as in prevents agents 
revealing information that they might better keep hidden 
another form of parsimony is to insist that agents are not 
allowed to put forward arguments that will be undercut by 
arguments that have already been made during the dialogue 
we therefore distinguish such arguments 
 
see for examples of dialogues where this is not the case 
 
we consider such reasoning sub-types of rhetoric 
definition consider a dialogue d consisting of a 
sequence of moves mi with a corresponding argument graph 
ag the move mi and the argument it puts forward 
ai are both said to be pre-empted if ai is undercut by 
some a ∈ ai 
we use the term pre-empted because if such an argument 
is put forward it can seem as though another agent 
anticipated the argument being made and already made an 
argument that would render it useless in the rest of this 
paper we will only deal with protocols that permit moves 
that are relevant in any of the senses introduced above and 
are not allowed to be pre-empted we call such protocols 
basic protocols and dialogues carried out under such protocols 
basic dialogues 
the argument graph of a basic dialogue is somewhat 
restricted 
proposition consider a basic dialogue d the 
argumentation graph ag that corresponds to d is a tree with 
a single root 
proof recall that definition requires only that ag 
be a directed graph to show that it is a tree we have to 
show that it is acyclic and connected 
that the graph is connected follows from the construction 
of the graph under a protocol that enforces relevance if the 
notion of relevance is r each move adds a node that is 
connected to the previous node if the notion of relevance is 
r then every move adds a node that is connected to the 
root and thus is connected to some node in the graph if the 
notion of relevance is r then every move has to change the 
status of the argument denoted by the root proposition 
tells us that to affect the status of an argument a the node 
v representing the argument a that is effecting the change 
has to be connected to v the node representing a and so 
it follows that every new node added as a result of an 
r relevant move will be connected to the argumentation graph 
thus ag is connected 
since a basic dialogue does not allow moves that are 
preempted every edge that is added during construction is 
directed from the node that is added to one already in the graph 
 thus denoting that the argument a denoted by the added 
node v undercuts the argument a denoted by the node to 
which the connection is made v rather than the other way 
around since every edge that is added is directed from the 
new node to the rest of the graph there can be no cycles 
thus ag is a tree 
to show that ag has a single root consider its 
construction from the initial node after m the graph has one node 
v that is both a root and a leaf after m the graph is two 
nodes connected by an edge and v is now a root and not a 
leaf v is a leaf and not a root however the third node is 
added the argument earlier in this proof demonstrates that 
there will be a directed edge from it to some other node 
making it a leaf thus v will always be the only root the ruling 
out of pre-empted moves means that v will never cease to 
be a root and so the argumentation graph will always have 
one root 
since every argumentation graph constructed by a basic 
dialogue is a tree with a single root this means that the first 
node of every argumentation graph is the root 
although these results are straightforward to obtain they 
allow us to show how the notions of relevance are related 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
proposition consider a basic dialogue d 
consisting of a sequence of moves mi with a corresponding 
argument graph ag 
 every move mi that is r -relevant is r -relevant 
the converse does not hold 
 every move mi that is r -relevant is r -relevant 
the converse does not hold 
 not every move mi that is r -relevant is r -relevant 
and not every move mi that is r -relevant is 
r relevant 
proof for consider how move mi can satisfy r 
proposition tells us that if ai can change the status 
of the argument denoted by the root v which as observed 
above is the first node of ag then vi must be connected 
to the root this is precisely what is required to satisfy r 
and the relatiosnhip is proved to hold 
to see that the converse does not hold we have to consider 
what it takes to change the status of r since proposition 
tells us that connectedness is not enough to ensure a change 
of status - if it did r and r relevance would coincide 
for mi to change the status of the root it will have to 
make the argument a represented by r either unacceptable 
if it were acceptable before the move or acceptable if it 
were unacceptable before the move given the definition of 
acceptability it can achieve either by directly 
undercutting the argument represented by r in which case vi will 
be directly connected to r by some edge or by undercutting 
some argument a that is part of the set of non-undercut 
arguments defending a in the latter case vi will be 
directly connected to the node representing a and by 
proposition to r to achieve vi will have to undercut 
an argument a that is either currently undercutting a or 
is undercutting an argument that would otherwise defend a 
now further consider that mi puts forward an argument 
ai that undercuts the argument denoted by some node v 
but this latter argument defends itself against ai in such 
a case the set of acceptable arguments will not change and 
so the status of ar will not change thus a move that is 
r -relevant need not be r -relevant 
for consider that mi can satisfy r simply by adding 
a node that is connected to vi the last node to be added 
to ag by proposition it is connected to r and so is 
r -relevant 
to see that the converse does not hold consider that an 
r -relevant move can connect to any node in ag 
the first part of follows by a similar argument to that we 
just used - an r -relevant move does not have to connect to 
vi just to some v that is part of the graph - and the second 
part follows since a move that is r -relevant may introduce 
an argument ai that undercuts the argument ai put 
forward by the previous move and so vi is connected to vi 
but finds that ai defends itself against ai preventing a 
change of status at the root 
what is most interesting is not so much the results but 
why they hold since this reveals some aspects of the 
interplay between relevance and the structure of argument 
graphs for example to restate a case from the proof of 
proposition a move that is r -relevant by definition has 
to add a node to the argument graph that is connected to the 
last node that was added since a move that is r -relevant 
can add a node that connects anywhere on an argument 
graph any move that is r -relevant will be r -relevant 
but the converse does not hold 
it turns out that we can exploit the interplay between 
structure and relevance that propositions and have 
started to illuminate to establish relationships between the 
protocols that govern dialogues and the argument graphs 
constructed during such dialogues to do this we need to 
define protocols in such a way that they refer to the structure 
of the graph we have 
definition a protocol is single-path if all dialogues 
that conform to it construct argument graphs that have only 
one branch 
proposition a basic protocol p is single-path if for 
all i the set of permitted moves mi at move i are all 
r relevant the converse does not hold 
proof r -relevance requires that every node added to 
the argument graph be connected to the previous node 
starting from the first node this recursively constructs a tree with 
just one branch and the relationship holds the converse 
does not hold because even if one or more moves in the 
protocol are r - or r -relevant it may be the case that because 
of an agent s rhetorical choice or because of its knowledge 
every argument that is chosen to be put forward will 
undercut the previous argument and so the argument graph is a 
one-branch tree 
looking for more complex kinds of protocol that construct 
more complex kinds of argument graph it is an obvious 
move to turn to 
definition a basic protocol is multi-path if all 
dialogues that conform to it can construct argument graphs that 
are trees 
but on reflection since any graph with only one branch is 
also a tree 
proposition any single-path protocol is an instance 
of a multi-path protocol 
and furthermore 
proposition any basic protocol p is multi-path 
proof immediate from proposition 
so the notion of a multi-path protocol does not have much 
traction as a result we distinguish multi-path protocols 
that permit dialogues that can construct trees that have 
more than one branch as bushy protocols we then have 
proposition a basic protocol p is bushy if for some 
i the set of permitted moves mi at move i are all r - or 
r -relevant 
proof from proposition we know that if all moves 
are r -relevant then we ll get a tree with one branch and 
from proposition we know that all basic protocols will 
build an argument graph that is a tree so providing we 
exclude r -relevant moves we will get protocols that can build 
multi-branch trees 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
of course since by proposition any move that is 
r relevant is r -relevant and can quite possibly be r -relevant 
 all that proposition tells us is that there is no 
guarantee that it will be all that proposition tells us is that 
dialogues that conform to bushy protocols may have more 
than one branch all we can do is to identify a bound on 
the number of branches 
proposition consider a basic dialogue d that 
includes m moves that are not r -relevant and has a 
corresponding argumentation graph ag the number of branches 
in ag is less than or equal to m 
proof since it must connect a node to the last node 
added to ag an r -relevant move can only extend an 
existing branch since they do not have the same restriction 
r and r -relevant moves may create a new branch by 
connecting to a node that is not the last node added every 
such move could create a new branch and if they do we 
will have m branches if there were r -relevant moves 
before any of these new-branch-creating moves then these m 
branches are in addition to the initial branch created by the 
r -relevant moves and we have a maximum of m 
possible branches 
we distinguish bushy protocols from multi-path protocols 
and hence r - and r -relevance from r -relevance because 
of the kinds of dialogue that r -relevance enforces in a 
dialogue in which all moves must be r -relevant the 
argumentation graph has a single branch - the dialogue consists of 
a sequence of arguments each of which undercuts the 
previous one and the last move to be made is the one that settles 
the dialogue this as we will see next means that such a 
dialogue only allows a subset of all the moves that would 
otherwise be possible 
 completeness 
the above discussion of the difference between dialogues 
carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us 
to the consideration of what called predeterminism 
but we now prefer to describe using the term 
completeness the idea of predeterminism as described in 
captures the notion that under some circumstances the 
result of a dialogue can be established without actually having 
the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for 
rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents 
of all the σi of all the αi ∈ a one would be able to 
identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject 
 we 
develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs 
constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare 
to benchmark complete dialogues we start by developing 
ideas of what complete might mean one reasonable 
definition is that 
definition a basic dialogue d between the set of 
agents a with a corresponding argumentation graph ag is 
topic-complete if no agent can construct an argument a that 
undercuts any argument a represented by a node in ag 
the argumentation graph constructed by a topic-complete 
dialogue is called a topic-complete argumentation graph and 
is denoted ag d t 
 
assuming that the σi do not change during the dialogue which is 
the usual assumption in this kind of dialogue 
a dialogue is topic-complete when no agent can add 
anything that is directly connected to the subject of the 
dialogue some protocols will prevent agents from making 
moves even though the dialogue is not topic-complete to 
distinguish such cases we have 
definition a basic dialogue d between the set of 
agents a with a corresponding argumentation graph ag is 
protocol-complete under a protocol p if no agent can make 
a move that adds a node to the argumentation graph that is 
permitted by p 
the argumentation graph constructed by a protocol-complete 
dialogue is called a protocol-complete argumentation graph 
and is denoted ag d p clearly 
proposition any dialogue d under a basic protocol 
p is protocol-complete if it is topic-complete the converse 
does not hold in general 
proof if d is topic-complete no agent can make a move 
that will extend the argumentation graph this means that 
no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic 
protocol and so d is also protocol complete 
the converse does not hold since some basic dialogues 
 under a protocol that only permits r -relevant moves for 
example will not permit certain moves like the addition of 
a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph 
after more than two moves that would be allowed in a 
topiccomplete dialogue 
corollary for a basic dialogue d ag d p is a 
sub-graph of ag d t 
obviously from the definition of a sub-graph the converse 
of corollary does not hold in general 
the important distinction between topic- and 
protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the 
state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation 
graph - and is thus independent of the protocol while the 
latter is determined entirely by the protocol any time that 
a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather 
than topic completeness it is ending when agents still have 
things to say but can t because the protocol won t allow 
them to 
with these definitions of completeness our task is to 
relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that 
agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue 
that is in some sense important - to the notions of 
relevance we have developed - which determine what agents 
are allowed to say when we need very specific conditions to 
make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete it means 
that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when 
those conditions are not in force that is there are many 
ways they can bring dialogues to a close before everything 
that can be said has been said where few conditions are 
required or conditions are absent then dialogues between 
agents with the same knowledge will always play out the 
same way and rhetoric has no place we have 
proposition a protocol-complete basic dialogue d 
under a protocol which only allows r -relevant moves will 
be topic-complete only when ag d t has a single branch 
in which the nodes are labelled in increasing order from the 
root 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
proof given what we know about r -relevance the 
condition on ag d p having a single branch is obvious this 
is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain 
protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions like 
strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes 
in ag d t which is not subject to such restrictions being 
added to the graph only when ag d t includes the nodes 
in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put 
forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation 
graph be constructed 
given proposition these are the conditions under which 
dialogues conducted under the notion of r -relevance will 
always be predetermined and given how restrictive the 
conditions are such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for 
rhetoric to play a part 
to find similar conditions for dialogues composed of 
r and r -relevant moves we first need to distinguish between 
them we can do this in terms of the structure of the 
argumentation graph 
proposition consider a basic dialogue d with 
argumentation graph ag which has root r denoting an 
argument a if argument a denoted by node v is an an 
r relevant move m m is not r -relevant if and only if 
 there are two nodes v and v on the path between v 
and r and the argument denoted by v defends itself 
against the argument denoted by v or 
 there is an argument a denoted by node v that 
affects the status of a and the path from v to r has one 
or more nodes in common with the path from v to r 
proof for the first condition consider that since ag is 
a tree v is connected to r thus there is a series of undercut 
relations between a and a and this corrresponds to a path 
through ag if this path is the only branch in the tree then 
a will affect the status of a unless the chain of affect 
is broken by an undercut that can t change the status of the 
undercut argument because the latter defends itself 
for the second condition as for the first the only way 
that a cannot affect the status of a is if something is 
blocking its influence if this is not due to defending against 
it must be because there is some node u on the path that 
represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow and 
that must mean that there is another chain of undercut 
relations another branch of the tree that is incident at u since 
this second branch denotes another chain of arguments and 
these affect the status of the argument denoted by u they 
must also affect the status of a any of these are the a in 
the condition 
so an r -relevant move m is not r -relevant if either its 
effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong 
enough or because there is another line of argument that 
is currently determining the status of the argument at the 
root this in turn means that if the effect is not due to 
defending against then there is an alternative move that 
is r -relevant - a move that undercuts a in the second 
condition above 
 we can now show 
 
though whether the agent in question can make such a move is 
another question 
proposition a protocol-complete basic dialogue d 
will always be topic-complete under a protocol which only 
includes r -relevant moves and allows every r -relevant move 
to be made 
the restriction on r -relevant rules is exactly that for 
topiccompleteness so a dialogue that has only r -relevant moves 
will continue until every argument that any agent can make 
has been put forward given this and what we revealed 
about r -relevance in proposition we can see that 
proposition a protocol-complete basic dialogue d 
under a protocol which only includes r -relevant moves will 
be topic-complete if ag d t 
 includes no path with adjacent nodes v denoting a 
and v denoting a such that a undercuts a and a 
is stronger that a and 
 is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive 
indices and no node with degree greater than two is an 
odd number of arcs from a leaf node 
proof the first condition rules out the first condition 
in proposition and the second deals with the situation 
that leads to the second condition in proposition the 
second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in 
full before any new branch is added and when a new branch 
is added the argument that is undercut as part of the 
addition will be acceptable and so the addition will change the 
status of the argument denoted by that node and hence the 
root with these conditions every move required to 
construct ag d t will be permitted and so the dialogue will be 
topic-complete when every move has been completed 
the second part of this result only identifies one possible 
way to ensure that the second condition in proposition 
is met so the converse of this result does not hold 
however what we have is sufficient to answer the 
question about predetermination that we started with for 
dialogues to be predetermined every move that is r -relevant 
must be made in such cases every dialogue is topic 
complete if we do not require that all r -relevant moves are 
made then there is some room for rhetoric - the way in 
which alternative lines of argument are presented becomes 
an issue if moves are forced to be r -relevant then there 
is considerable room for rhetorical play 
 summary 
this paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in 
argumentation-based dialogue identifying the relationship 
between these ideas and showing how they can impact the 
extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a 
dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and 
tactics of a dialogue this extends existing work on 
relvance such as by showing how different notions of 
relevance can have an effect on the outcome of a dialogue 
in particular when they render the outcome predetermined 
this connection extends the work of which considered 
dialogue outcome but stopped short of identifying the 
conditions under which it is predetermined 
there are two ways we are currently trying to extend this 
work both of which will generalise the results and extend its 
applicability first we want to relax the restrictions that 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
we have imposed the exclusion of moves that attack 
several arguments without which the argument graph can be 
mulitply-connected and the exclusion of pre-empted moves 
without which the argument graph can have cycles 
second we want to extend the ideas of relevance to cope with 
moves that do not only add undercutting arguments but 
also supporting arguments thus taking account of bipolar 
argumentation frameworks
