 introduction 
the research area of optimal mechanism design looks at 
designing a mechanism to produce the most desirable outcome for the 
entity running the mechanism this problem is well studied for the 
auction design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one 
that brings the seller the most profit here the classical approach 
is to design such a mechanism given the prior distribution from 
which the bidders preferences are drawn see e g 
recently goldberg et al introduced the use of worst-case 
competitive analysis see e g to analyze the performance of auctions 
that have no knowledge of the prior distribution the goal of such 
work is to design an auction that achieves a large constant fraction 
of the profit attainable by an optimal mechanism that knows the 
prior distribution in advance positive results in this direction are 
fueled by the observation that in auctions for a number of identical 
units much of the distribution from which the bidders are drawn 
can be deduced on the fly by the auction as it is being run 
 
the performance of an auction in such a worst-case competitive 
analysis is measured by its competitive ratio the ratio between a 
benchmark performance and the auction s performance on the input 
distribution that maximizes this ratio the holy grail of the 
worstcase competitive analysis of auctions is the auction that achieves 
the optimal competitive ratio as small as possible since this 
search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the 
optimal auction the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these 
scenarios and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction in this 
paper we continue this line of research by improving in all of these 
directions furthermore we give evidence corroborating the 
conjecture that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the 
benchmark used in the auction s competitive analysis this result 
further validates the use of competitive analysis in gauging auction 
performance 
we consider the single item multi-unit unit-demand auction 
problem in such an auction there are many units of a single item 
available for sale to bidders who each desire only one unit each bidder 
has a valuation representing how much the item is worth to him 
the auction is performed by soliciting a sealed bid from each of 
the bidders and deciding on the allocation of units to bidders and 
the prices to be paid by the bidders the bidders are assumed to bid 
so as to maximize their personal utility the difference between their 
valuation and the price they pay to handle the problem of 
designing and analyzing auctions where bidders may falsely declare their 
valuations to get a better deal we will adopt the solution concept 
of truthful mechanism design see e g in a truthful 
auction revealing one s true valuation as one s bid is an optimal 
strategy for each bidder regardless of the bids of the other bidders 
in this paper we will restrict our attention to truthful a k a 
incentive compatible or strategyproof auctions 
a particularly interesting special case of the auction problem is 
the unlimited supply case in this case the number of units for sale is 
at least the number of bidders in the auction this is natural for the 
sale of digital goods where there is negligible cost for duplicating 
 
and distributing the good pay-per-view television and 
downloadable audio files are examples of such goods 
the competitive framework introduced in and further refined 
in uses the profit of the optimal omniscient single priced 
mechanism that sells at least two units as the benchmark for competitive 
analysis the assumption that two or more units are sold is 
necessary because in the worst case it is impossible to obtain a constant 
fraction of the profit of the optimal mechanism when it sells only 
one unit in this framework for competitive analysis an auction 
is said to be β-competitive if it achieves a profit that is within a 
factor of β ≥ of the benchmark profit on every input the optimal 
auction is the one which is β-competitive with the minimum value 
of β 
previous to this work the best known auction for the unlimited 
supply case had a competitive ratio of and the best lower 
bound known was for the limited supply case auctions 
can achieve substantially better competitive ratios when there are 
only two units for sale the optimal auction gives a competitive ratio 
of which matches the lower bound for two units when there 
are three units for sale the best previously known auction had a 
competitive ratio of compared with a lower bound of ≈ 
 
the results of this paper are as follows 
 we give the auction for three units that is optimally 
competitive against the profit of the omniscient single priced 
mechanism that sells at least two units this auction achieves a 
competitive ratio of matching the lower bound from 
 section 
 we show that the form of the optimal auction is 
independent of the benchmark used in competitive analysis in doing 
so we give an optimal three bidder auction for generalized 
benchmarks section 
 we give a general technique for converting a limited supply 
auction into an unlimited supply auction where it is possible 
to use the competitive ratio of the limited supply auction to 
obtain a bound on the competitive ratio of the unlimited 
supply auction we refer to auctions derived from this 
framework as aggregation auctions section 
 we improve on the best known competitive ratio by 
proving that the aggregation auction constructed from our optimal 
three-unit auction is -competitive section 
 assuming that the conjecture that the optimal -unit auction 
has a competitive ratio that matches the lower bound proved 
in we show that this optimal auction for ≥ on some 
inputs will occasionally offer prices that are higher than any 
bid in that input section for the three-unit case where we 
have shown that the lower bound of is tight this 
observation led to our construction of the optimal three-unit auction 
 definitions and background 
we consider single-round sealed-bid auctions for a set of 
identical units of an item to bidders who each desire one unit as 
mentioned in the introduction we adopt the game-theoretic solution 
concept of truthful mechanism design a useful simplification of 
the problem of designing truthful auctions is obtained through the 
following algorithmic characterization related formulations to 
this one have appeared in numerous places in recent literature e g 
 
definition given a bid vector of n bids b b bn 
let b-i denote the vector of with bi replaced with a   i e 
b-i b bi− bi bn 
definition let f be a function from bid vectors with a 
  to prices non-negative real numbers the deterministic 
bidindependent auction defined by f bif works as follows for each 
bidder i 
 set ti f b-i 
 if ti bi bidder i wins at price ti 
 if ti bi bidder i loses 
 otherwise ti bi the auction can either accept the bid at 
price ti or reject it 
a randomized bid-independent auction is a distribution over 
deterministic bid-independent auctions 
the proof of the following theorem can be found for example 
in 
theorem an auction is truthful if and only if it is equivalent 
to a bid-independent auction 
given this equivalence we will use the the terminology 
bidindependent and truthful interchangeably 
for a randomized bid-independent auction f b-i is a random 
variable we denote the probability density of f b-i at z by ρb-i z 
we denote the profit of a truthful auction a on input b as a b 
the expected profit of the auction e a b is the sum of the 
expected payments made by each bidder which we denote by pi b 
for bidder i clearly the expected payment of each bid satisfies 
pi b 
bi 
 
xρb-i x dx 
 competitive framework 
we now review the competitive framework from in order 
to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of 
profit maximization we introduce the optimal single price 
omniscient auction f and the related omniscient auction f 
 
definition give a vector b b bn let b i 
represent the i-th largest value in b 
the optimal single price omniscient auction f is defined as 
follows auction f on input b determines the value k such that 
kb k is maximized all bidders with bi ≥ b k win at price b k all 
remaining bidders lose the profit of f on input b is thus f b 
max ≤k≤n kb k 
in the competitive framework of and subsequent papers the 
performance of a truthful auction is gauged in comparison to f 
 
the optimal singled priced auction that sells at least two units the 
profit of f 
is max ≤k≤n kb k there are a number of reasons 
to choose this benchmark for comparison interested readers should 
see or for a more detailed discussion 
let a be a truthful auction we say that a is β-competitive 
against f 
 or just β-competitive if for all bid vectors b the 
expected profit of a on b satisfies 
e a b ≥ 
f 
 b 
β 
 
in section we generalize this framework to other profit 
benchmarks 
 
 scale invariant and symmetric auctions 
a symmetric auction is one where the auction outcome is 
unchanged when the input bids arrive in a different permutation 
goldberg et al show that a symmetric auction achieves the optimal 
competitive ratio this is natural as the profit benchmark we 
consider is symmetric and it allows us to consider only symmetric 
auctions when looking for the one with the optimal competitive 
ratio 
an auction defined by bid-independent function f is scale 
invariant if for all i and all z pr f b-i ≥ z pr f cb-i ≥ cz 
it is conjectured that the assumption of scale invariance is without 
loss of generality thus we are motivated to consider 
symmetric scale-invariant auctions when specifying a symmetric 
scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the 
relative magnitudes of the n − bids in b-i and that one of the 
bids bj it will be convenient to specify such auctions via the 
density function of f b-i ρb-i z it is enough to specify such a 
density function of the form ρ z zn− z with ≤ zi ≤ zi 
 limited supply versus unlimited supply 
following throughout the remainder of this paper we will 
be making the assumption that n i e the number of bidders 
is equal to the number of units for sale this is without loss of 
generality as a any lower bound that applies to the n case 
also extends to the case where n ≥ and b there is a 
reduction from the unlimited supply auction problem to the limited 
supply auction problem that takes an unlimited supply auction that 
is β-competitive with f 
and constructs a limited supply auction 
parameterized by that is β-competitive with f 
 the optimal 
omniscient auction that sells between and units 
henceforth we will assume that we are in the unlimited supply 
case and we will examine lower bounds for limited supply 
problems by placing a restriction on the number of bidders in the 
auction 
 lower bounds and optimal auctions 
frequently in this paper we will refer to the best known lower 
bound on the competitive ratio of truthful auctions 
theorem the competitive ratio of any auction on n 
bidders is at least 
 − 
n 
i 
− 
n 
i− 
i 
i − 
n − 
i − 
 
definition let υn denote the n-bidder auction that achieves 
the optimal competitive ratio 
this bound is derived by analyzing the performance of any 
auction on the following distribution b in each random bid 
vector b each bid bi is drawn i i d from the distribution such that 
pr bi ≥ s ≤ s for all s ∈ s 
in the two-bidder case this lower bound is this is achieved by 
υ which is the -unit vickrey auction 
in the three-bidder case 
this lower bound is in the next section we define the 
auction υ which matches this lower bound in the four-bidder case 
this lower bound is in the limit as the number of bidders 
grows this lower bound approaches a number which is 
approximately 
it is conjectured that this lower bound is tight for any number of 
bidders and the optimal auction υn matches it 
 
the -unit vickrey auction sells to the highest bidder at the second 
highest bid value 
 profit extraction 
in this section we review the truthful profit extraction mechanism 
profitextractr this mechanism is a special case of a general 
cost-sharing schema due to moulin and shenker 
the goal of profit extraction is given bids b to extract a target 
value r of profit from some subset of the bidders 
profitextractr given bids b find the largest k such 
that the highest k bidders can equally share the cost 
r charge each of these bidders r k if no subset 
of bidders can cover the cost the mechanism has no 
winners 
important properties of this auction are as follows 
 profitextractr is truthful 
 if r ≤ f b profitextractr b r otherwise it has no 
winners and no revenue 
we will use this profit extraction mechanism in section with 
the following intuition such a profit extractor makes it possible to 
treat this subset of bidders as a single bid with value f s note 
that given a single bid b a truthful mechanism might offer it price 
t and if t ≤ b then the bidder wins and pays t otherwise the 
bidder pays nothing and loses likewise a mechanism can offer 
the set of bidders s a target revenue r if r ≤ f 
 s then 
profitextractr raises r from s otherwise the it raises no 
revenue from s 
 an optimal auction for three 
bidders 
in this section we define the optimal auction for three bidders 
υ and prove that it indeed matches the known lower bound of 
 we follow the definition and proof with a discussion of how 
this auction was derived 
definition υ is scale-invariant and symmetric and given 
by the bid-independent function with density function

theorem the υ auction has a competitive ratio of ≈ 
 which is optimal furthermore the auction raises exactly 
 
 
f 
on every input with non-identical bids 
proof consider the bids x y with x y there are 
three cases 
case x y ≤ f 
 the auction must raise 
expected revenue of at least on these bids the bidder with 
valuation x will pay with and the bidder with valuation y 
will pay with probability therefore υ raises on 
these bids 
case x ≤ y f 
 the auction must raise 
expected revenue of at least on these bids the bidder with 
 
valuation x will pay −

zg z dz in expectation the

therefore υ raises on these bids

the final equation comes from substituting in g x

expanding the integrals note that the fraction of f 
raised on 
every input is identical if any of the inequalities ≤ x ≤ y 
are not strict the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the 
auction s profit however this bound may no longer be tight 
motivation for υ 
in this section we will conjecture that a particular input distribution 
is worst-case and show as a consequence that all inputs are 
worstcase in the optimal auction by applying this consequence we will 
derive an optimal auction for three bidders 
a truthful randomized auction on n bidders can be represented 
by a randomized function f rn− 
× n → r that maps masked 
bid vectors to prices in r by normalization we can assume that 
the lowest possible bid is recall that ρb-i z pr f b-i z 
the optimal auction for the finite auction problem can be found 
by the following optimization problem in which the variables are 
ρb-i z 
maximize r 
subject to 
n 
i

zρb-i z dz ≥ rf 
 b 
∞ 
z 
ρb-i z dz 
ρb-i z ≥ 
this set of integral inequalities is difficult to maximize over 
however by guessing which constraints are tight and which are 
slack at the optimum we will be able to derive a set of differential 
equations for which any feasible solution is an optimal auction 
as we discuss in section in the authors define a 
distribution and use it to find a lower bound on the competitive ratio of 
the optimal auction for two bidders this bid distribution is the 
worst-case input distribution we guess and later verify that this 
distribution is the worst-case input distribution for three bidders as 
well since this distribution has full support over the set of all bid 
vectors and a worst-case distribution puts positive probability only 
on worst-case inputs we can therefore assume that all but a 
measure zero set of inputs is worst-case for the optimal auction in the 
optimal two-bidder auction all inputs with non-identical bids are 
worst-case so we will assume the same for three bidders 
the guess that these constraints are tight allows us to transform 
the optimization problem into a feasibility problem constrained by 
differential equations if the solution to these equations has value 
matching the lower bound obtained from the worst-case 
distribution then this solution is the optimal auction and that our 
conjectured choice of worst-case distribution is correct 
in section we show that the optimal auction must sometimes 
place probability mass on sale prices above the highest bid this 
motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three 
bidders with probability density function ρ x z of the following 
form 
ρ x z 
⎧ 
⎪⎨ 
⎪⎩ 
 with discrete probability a x 
x with discrete probability b x 
z with probability density g z for z x 
in this auction the sale price for the first bidder is either one 
of the latter two bids or higher than either bid with a probability 
density which is independent of the input 
the feasibility problem which arises from the linear optimization 
problem by assuming the constraints are tight is as follows

zg z dz r max x ∀x y

solving this feasibility problem gives the auction υ proposed 
above the proof of its optimality validates its proposed form 
finding a simple restriction on the form of n-bidder auctions for 
n under which the optimal auction can be found analytically 
as above remains an open problem 
 generalized profit benchmarks 
in this section we widen our focus beyond auctions that compete 
with f 
to consider other benchmarks for an auction s profit we 
will show that for three bidders the form of the optimal auction 
is essentially independent of the benchmark profit used this 
results strongly corroborates the worst-case competitive analysis of 
auctions by showing that our techniques allow us to derive auctions 
which are competitive against a broad variety of reasonable 
benchmarks rather than simply against f 
 
previous work in competitive analysis of auctions has focused on 
the question of designing the auction with the best competitive 
ratio against f 
 the profit of the optimal omniscient single-priced 
mechanism that sells at least two items however it is reasonable to 
consider other benchmarks for instance one might wish to 
compete against v 
 the profit of the k-vickrey auction with 
optimal-inhindsight choice of k 
alternatively if an auction is being used as 
a subroutine in a larger mechanism one might wish to choose the 
auction which is optimally competitive with a benchmark specific 
to that purpose 
recall that f 
 b max ≥k≥n kb k we can generalize this 
definition to gs parameterized by s s sn and defined as 
gs b max 
 ≤k≤n 
skb k 
when considering gs we assume without loss of generality that 
si si as otherwise the constraint imposed by si is irrelevant 
note that f 
is the special case of gs with si i and that v 
 
gs with si i − 
 
recall that the k-vickrey auction sells a unit to each of the 
highest k bidders at a price equal to the k st highest bid b k 
achieving a profit of kb k 
 
competing with gs 
we will now design a three-bidder auction υs t 
 that achieves the 
optimal competitive ratio against gs t as before we will first find 
a lower bound on the competitive ratio and then design an auction 
to meet that bound 
we can lower bound the competitive ratio of υs t 
 using the same 
worst-case distribution from that we used against f 
 
evaluating the performance of any auction competing against gs t on 
this distribution will yield the following theorem we denote the 
optimal auction for three bidders against gs t as υs t 
 
theorem the optimal three-bidder auction υs t 
 
competing against gs t b max sb tb has a competitive ratio of 
at least s 
 t 
 t 
 
the proof can be found in the appendix 
similarly we can find the optimal auction against gs t using the 
same technique we used to solve for the three bidder auction with 
the best competitive ratio against f 
 
definition υs t 
 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given 
by the bid-independent function with density function

theorem υs t

-competitive with gs t 
this auction like υ can be derived by reducing the optimization 
problem to a feasibility problem guessing that the optimal solution 
has the same form as υs t 
 and solving the auction is optimal 
because it matches the lower bound found above note that the form 
of υs t 
 is essentially the same as for υ but that the probability of 
each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t 
that our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound 
computed by the input distribution used in is strong evidence that 
this input distribution is the worst-case input distribution for any 
number of bidders and any generalized profit benchmark 
furthermore we strongly suspect that for any number of bidders the form 
of the optimal auction will be independent of the benchmark used 
 aggregation auctions 
we have seen that optimal auctions for small cases of the 
limitedsupply model can be found analytically in this section we will 
construct a schema for turning limited supply auctions into 
unlimited supply auctions with a good competitive ratio 
as discussed in section the existence of a profit 
extractor profitextractr allows an auction to treat a set of bids s 
as a single bid with value f s given n bidders and an 
auction am for m n bidders we can convert the m-bidder 
auction into an n-bidder auction by randomly partitioning the bidders 
into m subsets and then treating each subset as a single bidder via 
profitextractr and running the m-bidder auction 
definition given a truthful m-bidder auction am the 
m-aggregation auction for am aggam 
 works as follows 
 cast each bid uniformly at random into one of m bins 
resulting in bid vectors b 
 b m 
 
 for each bin j compute the aggregate bid bj f b j 
 
let b be the vector of aggregate bids and b−j be the 
aggregate bids for all bins other than j 
 compute the aggregate price tj f b−j where f is the 
bid-independent function for am 
 for each bin j run profitextracttj on b j 
 
since am and profitextractr are truthful tj is computed 
independently of any bid in bin j and thus the price offered any bidder 
in b j 
is independent of his bid therefore 
theorem if am is truthful the m-aggregation auction for 
am aggam 
 is truthful 
note that this schema yields a new way of understanding the 
random sampling profit extraction rspe auction as the 
simplest case of an aggregation auction it is the -aggregation auction 
for υ the -unit vickrey auction 
to analyze aggam 
 consider throwing k balls into m labeled 
bins let k represent a configuration of balls in bins so that ki is 
equal to the number of balls in bin i and k i is equal to the number 
of balls in the ith largest bin let km k represent the set of all 
possible configurations of k balls in m bins we write the multinomial 
coefficient of k as k 
k 
 the probability that a particular 
configuration k arises by throwing balls into bins uniformly at random is 
k 
k 
m−k 
 
theorem let am be an auction with competitive ratio β 
then the m-aggregation auction for am aggam

follows by rewriting this expectation as a sum over all k in km k 
 a competitive auction 
we apply the aggregation auction schema to υ our optimal 
auction for three bidders to achieve an auction with competitive 
ratio this improves on the previously best known auction 
which is -competitive 
theorem the aggregation auction for υ has competitive 
ratio

note that the above bound on the competitive ratio of aggυ 
is tight to see this consider the bid vector with two very large 
and non-identical bids of h and h with the remaining bids 
given that the competitive ratio of υ is tight on this example 
the expected revenue of this auction on this input will be exactly 
 
 a gs t-based aggregation auction 
in this section we show that υ is not the optimal auction to 
use in an aggregation auction one can do better by choosing the 
auction that is optimally competitive against a specially tailored 
benchmark 
to see why this might be the case notice table that the 
fraction of f 
 b raised for when there are k and k 
winning bidders in f 
 b is substantially smaller than the fraction of 
f 
 b raised when there are more winners this occurs because 
the expected ratio between f 
 b and f 
 b is lower in this 
case while the competitive ratio of υ is constant if we chose a 
three bidder auction that performed better when f 
has smaller 
numbers of winners our aggregation auction would perform better 
in the worst case 
one approach is to compete against a different benchmark that 
puts more weight than f 
on solutions with a small number of 
winners recall that f 
is the instance of gs t with s and 
t by using the auction that competes optimally against gs t 
with s while holding t we will raise a higher 
fraction of revenue on smaller numbers of winning bidders and a lower 
fraction of revenue on large numbers of winning bidders we can 
numerically optimize the values of s and t in gs t b in order to 
achieve the best competitive ratio for the aggregation auction in 
fact this will allow us to improve our competitive ratio slightly 
theorem for an optimal choice of s and t the aggregation 
auction for υs t 
 is -competitive 
the proof follows the outline of theorem and with the 
optimal choice of s while t is held constant at 
 further reducing the competitive ratio 
there are a number of ways we might attempt to use this 
aggregation auction schema to continue to push the competitive ratio 
down in this section we give a brief discussion of several attempts 
 aggυm 
for m 
if the aggregation auction for υ has a competitive ratio of 
and the aggregation auction for υ has a competitive ratio of 
can we improve the competitive ratio by aggregating υ or υm 
for larger m we conjecture in the negative for m the 
aggregation auction for υm has a larger competitive ratio than the 
aggregation auction for υ the primary difficulty in proving this

conjecture lies in the difficulty of finding a closed-form solution

formula numerically for different values of m and k assuming that the

 convex combinations of aggυm 
as can be seen in table when m the worst-case value 
of k is no longer and but instead an increasing function of 
m an aggregation auction for υm outperforms the aggregation 
auction for υ when there are two or three winning bidders while 
the aggregation auction for υ outperforms the other when there 
are at least six winning bidders thus for instance an auction 
which randomizes between aggregation auctions for υ and υ 
will have a worst-case which is better than that of either auction 
alone larger combinations of auctions will allow more room to 
optimize the worst-case however we suspect that no convex 
combination of aggregation auctions will have a competitive ratio lower 
than furthermore note that we cannot yet claim the existence of 
a good auction via this technique as the optimal auction υn for 
n is not known and it is only conjectured that the bound given 
by theorem and represented in table is correct for υn 
 a lower bound for conservative 
auctions 
in this section we define a class of auctions that never offer a 
sale price which is higher than any bid in the input and prove a 
lower bound on the competitive ratio of these auctions as this 
 
lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of theorem for 
n ≥ it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge 
a sales price higher than any bid in the input specifically this result 
partially explains the form of the optimal three bidder auction 
definition we say an auction bif is conservative if its 
bidindependent function f satisfies f b-i ≤ max b-i 
we can now state our lower bound for conservative auctions 
theorem let a be a conservative auction for n bidders 
then the competitive ratio of a is at least n− 
n 
 
corollary the competitive ratio of any conservative 
auction for an arbitrary number of bidders is at least three 
for a two-bidder auction this restriction does not prevent 
optimality υ the -unit vickrey auction is conservative for larger 
numbers of bidders however the restriction to conservative 
auctions does affect the competitive ratio for the three-bidder case 
υ has competitive ratio while the best conservative auction 
is no better than -competitive 
the k-vickrey auction and the random sampling optimal price 
auction are conservative auctions the random sampling profit 
extraction auction and the core auction on the other hand 
use the profitextractr mechanism as a subroutine and thus 
sometimes offer a sale price which is higher than the highest input bid 
value 
in the authors define a restricted auction as one on which 
for any input the sale prices are drawn from the set of input bid 
values the class of conservative auctions can be viewed as a 
generalization of the class of restricted auctions and therefore our result 
below gives lower bounds on the performance of a broader class of 
auctions 
we will prove theorem with the aid of the following lemma 
lemma let a be a conservative auction with competitive 
ratio r for n bidders let h n let h and hk kh 
otherwise then for all k and h ≥ kh pr f h ≤ hk ≥ 
nr− 
n− 
 k nr− r−n 
n− 
 
proof the lemma is proved by strong induction on k first 
some notation that will be convenient for any particular k and 
h we will be considering the bid vector b hk h 
and placing bounds on ρb-i z since we can assume without loss 
of generality that the auction is symmetric we will notate b- as 
b with any one of the -valued bids masked similarly we notate 
b-hk 
 resp b-h as b with the hk-valued bid resp h-valued bid 
masked we will also let p b phk 
 b and ph b represent the 
expected payment of a -valued hk-valued and h-valued bidder 
in a on b respectively note by symmetry the expected payment 
for all -valued bidders is the same 
base case k hk a must raise revenue of at least rn 
on b h 
rn ≤ ph b n − p b 
 n − 
 
 
xρb- x dx 
≤ n − 
 
 
ρb- x dx 
the second inequality follows from the conservatism of the 
underlying auction the base case follows trivially from the final 
inequality 
inductive case k hk kh let b hk h 
first we will find an upper bound on ph b

equation follows from the conservatism of a and is from 
invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with h kh and the 
observation that the maximum possible revenue will be found by 
placing exactly enough probability at each multiple of h to satisfy 
the constraints of the inductive hypothesis and placing the 
remaining probability at kh next we will find a lower bound on phk 
 b 
by considering the revenue raised by the bids b recall that a must 
obtain a profit of at least rf 
 b rkh given upper-bounds 
on the profit from the h-valued equation bid and the -valued 
bids the profit from the hk-valued bid must be at least

in order to lower bound pr f b-hk 
 ≤ kh consider the auction 
that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained 
by the strong inductive hypothesis on pr f b-hk 
 ≤ ih to 
minimize the constraints implied by the strong inductive hypothesis we 
place the minimal amount of probability mass required each price

 in order to 
satisfy our lower bound on phk 
 b it must put at least nr− r−n

therefore the probability that the sale price will be no more than 
kh on masked bid vector on bid vector b kh h must 
be at least nr−

proof let a be a conservative auction suppose nr− r−n

 let k h ≥ kh and h n by lemma

 the theorem 
follows 
 conclusions and future work 
we have found the optimal auction for the three-unit 
limitedsupply case and shown that its structure is essentially independent 
of the benchmark used in its competitive analysis we have then 
used this auction to derive the best known auction for the unlimited 
supply case 
our work leaves many interesting open questions we found that 
the lower bound of is matched by an auction for three bidders 
 
even when competing against generalized benchmarks the most 
interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound 
from theorem can be matched by an auction for more than three 
bidders we conjecture that it can 
second we consider whether our techniques can be extended 
to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders the use 
of our analytic solution method requires knowledge of a restricted 
class of auctions which is large enough to contain an optimal 
auction but small enough that the optimal auction in this class can be 
found explicitly through analytic methods no class of auctions 
which meets these criteria is known even for the four bidder case 
also when the number of bidders is greater than three it might 
be the case that the optimal auction is not expressible in terms of 
elementary functions 
another interesting set of open questions concerns aggregation 
auctions as we show the aggregation auction for υ outperforms 
the aggregation auction for υ and it appears that the aggregation 
auction for υ is better than υm for m we leave 
verification of this conjecture for future work we also show that υ is 
not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction 
but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive 
ratio of the overall auction only a little bit it would be interesting 
to know whether for any m there is an m-aggregation auction that 
substantially improves on the competitive ratio of aggυm 
 
finally we remark that very little is known about the structure 
of the optimal competitive auction in our auction υ the sales 
price for a given bidder is restricted either to be one of the other bid 
values or to be higher than all other bid values the optimal 
auction for two bidders the -unit vickrey auction also falls within 
this class of auctions as its sales prices are restricted to bid values 
we conjecture that an optimal auction for any number of bidders 
lies within this class our paper provides partial evidence for this 
conjecture the lower bound of section on conservative auctions 
shows that the optimal auction must offer sales prices higher than 
any bid value if the lower bound of theorem is tight as is 
conjectured it remains to show that optimal auctions otherwise only 
offer sales prices at bid values

 our proof 
follows the outline of the proof of lemma and theorem from 
however our case is simpler because we only looking for a bound 
when n define the random bid vector b b b b 
with pr bi z z we compute eb gs t b by integrating 
pr gs t b z then we use the fact that no auction can have 
expected profit greater than on b to find a lower bound on the 
competitive ratio against gs t for any auction 
for the input distribution b defined above let b i be the ith 
largest bid define the disjoint events h b ≥ z s ∧ b 
z t and h b ≥ z t intuitively h corresponds to the 
event that all three bidders win in gs t while h corresponds to 
the event that only the top two bidders win gs t b will be greater 
than z if either event occurs
