 introduction 
biologists search for literature on a daily basis for most 
biologists pubmed an online service of u s national library of 
medicine nlm is the most commonly used tool for searching 
the biomedical literature pubmed allows for keyword search by 
using boolean operators for example if one desires documents on 
the use of the drug propanolol in the disease hypertension a 
typical pubmed query might be propanolol and hypertension 
which will return all the documents having the two keywords 
keyword search in pubmed is effective if the query is well-crafted 
by the users using their expertise however information needs of 
biologists in some cases are expressed as complex questions 
 which pubmed is not designed to handle while nlm does 
maintain an experimental tool for free-text queries it is still 
based on pubmed keyword search 
the genomics track of the text retrieval conference 
 trec provides a common platform to assess the methods and 
techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information 
retrieval the queries were collected from real biologists and they 
are expressed as complex questions such as how do mutations in 
the huntingtin gene affect huntington s disease the document 
collection contains highwire full-text documents in 
html format systems from participating groups are expected to 
find relevant passages within the full-text documents a passage is 
defined as any span of text that does not include the html 
paragraph tag i e p or p 
we approached the problem by utilizing domain-specific 
knowledge in a conceptual retrieval model domain-specific 
knowledge in this paper refers to information about concepts and 
relationships between concepts in a certain domain we assume 
that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge might improve 
the effectiveness of retrieval for example given a query what is 
the role of gene prnp in the mad cow disease expanding the 
gene symbol prnp with its synonyms prp prpsc and 
prion protein more relevant documents might be retrieved 
pubmed and many other biomedical systems also 
make use of domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval 
effectiveness 
intuitively retrieval on the level of concepts should outperform 
bag-of-words approaches since the semantic relationships 
among words in a concept are utilized in some recent studies 
 positive results have been reported for this hypothesis in 
this paper concepts are entry terms of the ontology medical 
subject headings mesh a controlled vocabulary maintained by 
nlm for indexing biomedical literature or gene symbols in the 
entrez gene database also from nlm a concept could be a word 
such as the gene symbol prnp or a phrase such as mad cow 
diseases in the conceptual retrieval model presented in this 
paper the similarity between a query and a document is measured 
on both concept and word levels 
this paper makes two contributions 
 we propose a conceptual approach to utilize domain-specific 
knowledge in an ir system to improve its effectiveness in 
retrieving biomedical literature based on this approach our 
system achieved significant improvement over the best 
reported result in passage retrieval in the genomics track of 
trec 
 we examine the effects of utilizing concepts and of different 
types of domain-specific knowledge in performance 
contribution 
this paper is organized as follows problem statement is given in 
the next section the techniques are introduced in section in 
section we present the experimental results related works are 
given in section and finally we conclude the paper in section 
 problem statement 
we describe the queries document collection and the system 
output in this section 
the query set used in the genomics track of trec consists 
of questions collected from real biologists as described in 
these questions all have the following general format 
biological object m 
relationship 
←⎯⎯⎯⎯→ biological process n 
where a biological object might be a gene protein or gene 
mutation and a biological process can be a physiological process 
or disease a question might involve multiple biological objects 
 m and multiple biological processes n these questions were 
derived from four templates table 
table query templates and examples in the genomics track 
of trec 
template example 
what is the role of gene in 
disease 
what is the role of drd in 
alcoholism 
what effect does gene have 
on biological process 
what effect does the insulin 
receptor gene have on 
tumorigenesis 
how do genes interact in 
organ function 
how do hmg and hmgb 
interact in hepatitis 
how does a mutation in 
gene influence biological 
process 
how does a mutation in ret 
influence thyroid function 
features of the queries they are different from the typical 
web queries and the pubmed queries both of which usually 
consist of to keywords they are generated from structural 
templates which can be used by a system to identify the query 
components the biological object or process 
the document collection contains highwire full-text 
documents in html format 
the output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to 
their similarities with the query a passage is defined as any span 
of text that does not include the html paragraph tag i e p or 
 p a passage could be a part of a sentence a sentence a set of 
consecutive sentences or a paragraph i e the whole span of text 
that are inside of p and p html tags 
this is a passage-level information retrieval problem with the 
attempt to put biologists in contexts where relevant information is 
provided 
 techniques and methods 
we approached the problem by first retrieving the top-k most 
relevant paragraphs then extracting passages from these 
paragraphs and finally ranking the passages in this process we 
employed several techniques and methods which will be 
introduced in this section first we give two definitions 
definition a concept is a entry term in the mesh 
ontology or a gene symbol in the entrez gene database this 
definition of concept can be generalized to include other 
biomedical dictionary terms 
definition a semantic type is a category defined in the 
semantic network of the unified medical language system 
 umls the current release of the umls semantic network 
contains semantic types such as disease or syndrome each 
entry term in the mesh ontology is assigned one or more semantic 
types each gene symbol in the entrez gene database maps to the 
semantic type gene or genome in addition these semantic 
types are linked by relationships for example antibiotic 
prevents disease or syndrome these relationships among 
semantic types represent general biomedical knowledge we 
utilized these semantic types and their relationships to identify 
related concepts 
the rest of this section is organized as follows in section we 
explain how the concepts are identified within a query in section 
 we specify five different types of domain-specific knowledge 
and introduce how they are compiled in section we present 
our conceptual ir model finally our strategy for passage 
extraction is described in section 
 identifying concepts within a query 
a concept defined in definition is a gene symbol or a mesh 
term we make use of the query templates to identify gene 
symbols for example the query how do hmg and hmgb 
interact in hepatitis is derived from the template how do genes 
interact in organ function in this case hmg and hmgb 
will be identified as gene symbols in cases where the query 
templates are not provided programs for recognition of gene 
symbols within texts are needed 
we use the query translation functionality of pubmed to extract 
mesh terms in a query this is done by submitting the whole 
query to pubmed which will then return a file in which the mesh 
terms in the query are labeled in table three mesh terms 
within the query what is the role of gene prnp in the mad cow 
disease are found in the pubmed translation encephalopathy 
bovine spongiform for mad cow disease genes for gene 
and role for role 
table the pubmed translation of the query what is the 
role of gene prnp in the mad cow disease 
term pubmed translation 
mad cow 
disease 
 bovine spongiform encephalopathy text word 
or encephalopathy bovine spongiform mesh 
terms or mad cow disease text word 
gene 
 genes tiab not medline sb or 
 genes mesh terms or gene text word 
role role mesh terms or role text word 
 compiling domain-specific knowledge 
in this paper domain-specific knowledge refers to information 
about concepts and their relationships in a certain domain we 
used five types of domain-specific knowledge in the domain of 
genomics 
type synonyms terms listed in the thesauruses that refer to 
the same meaning 
type hypernyms more generic terms one level only 
type hyponyms more specific terms one level only 
type lexical variants different forms of the same concept 
such as abbreviations they are commonly used in the 
literature but might not be listed in the thesauruses 
type implicitly related concepts terms that are semantically 
related and also co-occur more frequently than being 
independent in the biomedical texts 
knowledge of type - is retrieved from the following two 
thesauruses mesh a controlled vocabulary maintained by 
nlm for indexing biomedical literature the version of 
mesh contains information about concepts these 
concepts are organized in a tree hierarchy entrez gene one of 
the most widely used searchable databases of genes the current 
version of entrez gene contains information about million 
genes it does not have a hierarchy only synonyms are retrieved 
from entrez gene the compiling of type - knowledge is 
introduced in section and respectively 
 lexical variants 
lexical variants of gene symbols 
new gene symbols and their lexical variants are regularly 
introduced into the biomedical literature however many 
reference databases such as umls and entrez gene may not be 
able to keep track of all this kind of variants for example for the 
gene symbol nf-kappa b at least different lexical variants can 
be found in the biomedical literature nf-kappab nfkappab 
 nfkappa b nf-kb and nfkb three of which are not in the 
current umls and two not in the entrez gene have shown 
that expanding gene symbols with their lexical variants improved 
the retrieval effectiveness of their biomedical ir systems in our 
system we employed the following two strategies to retrieve 
lexical variants of gene symbols 
strategy i this strategy is to automatically generate lexical 
variants according to a set of manually crafted heuristics 
for example given a gene symbol pla a variant plaii is 
generated according to the heuristic that roman numerals and 
arabic numerals are convertible when naming gene symbols 
another variant pla is also generated since a hyphen or a 
space could be inserted at the transition between alphabetic and 
numerical characters in a gene symbol 
strategy ii this strategy is to retrieve lexical variants from an 
abbreviation database adam is an abbreviation database 
which covers frequently used abbreviations and their definitions 
 or long-forms within medline the authoritative repository of 
citations from the biomedical literature maintained by the nlm 
given a query how does nucleoside diphosphate kinase nm 
contribute to tumor progression we first identify the 
abbreviation nm and its long-form nucleoside diphosphate 
kinase using the abbreviation identification program from 
searching the long-form nucleoside diphosphate kinase in 
adam other abbreviations such as ndpk or ndk are 
retrieved these abbreviations are considered as the lexical 
variants of nm 
lexical variants of mesh concepts 
adam is used to obtain the lexical variants of mesh concepts as 
well all the abbreviations of a mesh concept in adam are 
considered as lexical variants to each other in addition those 
long-forms that share the same abbreviation with the mesh 
concept and are different by an edit distance of or are also 
considered as its lexical variants as an example human 
papilloma viruses and human papillomaviruses have the same 
abbreviation hpv in adam and their edit distance is thus 
they are considered as lexical variants to each other the edit 
distance between two strings is measured by the minimum number 
of insertions deletions and substitutions of a single character 
required to transform one string into the other 
 implicitly related concepts 
motivation in some cases there are few documents in the 
literature that directly answer a given query in this situation those 
documents that implicitly answer their questions or provide 
supporting information would be very helpful for example there 
are few documents in pubmed that directly answer the query 
 what is the role of the genes hnf and coup-tf i in the 
suppression in the function of the liver however there exist 
some documents about the role of hnf and coup-tf i in 
regulating hepatitis b virus transcription it is very likely that the 
biologists would be interested in these documents because 
 hepatitis b virus is known as a virus that could cause serious 
damage to the function of liver in the given example hepatitis b 
virus is not a synonym hypernym hyponym nor a lexical variant 
of any of the query concepts but it is semantically related to the 
query concepts according to the umls semantic network we 
call this type of concepts implicitly related concepts of the 
query this notion is similar to the b-term used in for 
relating two disjoint literatures for biomedical hypothesis 
generation the difference is that we utilize the semantic 
relationships among query concepts to exclusively focus on 
concepts of certain semantic types 
a query q in format of section can be represented by 
q a c 
where a is the set of biological objects and c is the set of 
biological processes those concepts that are semantically related 
to both a and c according to the umls semantic network are 
considered as the implicitly related concepts of the query in the 
above example a hnf coup-tf i c function of 
liver and hepatitis b virus is one of the implicitly related 
concepts 
we make use of the medline database to extract the implicitly 
related concepts the version of medline database 
contains citations i e abstracts titles and etc of over million 
biomedical articles each document in medline is manually 
indexed by a list of mesh terms to describe the topics covered by 
that document implicitly related concepts are extracted and 
ranked in the following steps 
step let list a be the set of mesh terms that are used for 
indexing those medline citations having a and semantically 
related to a according to the umls semantic network similarly 
list c is created for c concepts in b list a ∩ list c are 
considered as implicitly related concepts of the query 
step for each concept b∈b compute the association between 
b and a using the mutual information measure 
p 
 log 
p p 
b a 
i b a 
b a 
 
where p x n n n is the number of medline citations having x 
and n is the size of medline a large value for i b a means 
that b and a co-occur much more often than being independent 
i b c is computed similarly 
step let r b i b a i b c for b∈ b given b b ∈ b 
we say r b ≤ r b if i b a ≤ i b a and i b c ≤ i b c 
then the association between b and the query q is measured by 
 and 
 
 and 
x x b r x r b 
score b q 
x x b r b r x 
∈ ≤ 
 
∈ ≤ 
 
the numerator in formula is the number of the concepts in b 
that are associated with both a and c equally with or less than b 
the denominator is the number of the concepts in b that are 
associated with both a and c equally with or more than b figure 
 shows the top implicitly related concepts for the sample 
query 
figure top implicitly related concepts for the query 
 how do interactions between hnf and coup-tf suppress 
liver function 
in figure the top implicitly related concepts are all highly 
associated with liver hepatocytes are liver cells 
hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver neoplasm occurring in 
young children the vast majority of gluconeogenesis takes 
place in the liver and hepatitis b virus is a virus that could 
cause serious damage to the function of liver 
the top-k ranked concepts in b are used for query expansion if 
i b a ≥ i b c then b is considered as an implicit related 
concept of a a document having b but not a will receive a partial 
weight of a the expansion is similar for c when i b a i b c 
 conceptual ir model 
we now discuss our conceptual ir model we first give the basic 
conceptual ir model in section then we explain how the 
domain-specific knowledge is incorporated in the model using 
query expansion in section a pseudo-feedback strategy is 
introduced in section in section we give a strategy to 
improve the ranking by avoiding incorrect match of abbreviations 
 basic model 
given a query q and a document d our model measures two 
similarities concept similarity and word similarity 
 
concept word 
sim q d sim q d sim q d 
concept similarity 
two vectors are derived from a query q 
 
 
 
 
 
 
m 
n 
q v v 
v c c c 
v c c c 
 
 
 
where v is a vector of concepts describing the biological object s 
and v is a vector of concepts describing the biological process es 
given a vector of concepts v let s v be the set of concepts in v 
the weight of vi is then measured by 
 max log and i i v 
v 
n 
w v s v s v n 
n 
 ⊆ 
where v is a vector that contains a subset of concepts in vi and nv is 
the number of documents having all the concepts in v 
the concept similarity between q and d is then computed by 
 
 
 i i 
concept i 
w vsim q d α 
 
 ×∑ 
where αi is a parameter to indicate the completeness of vi that 
document d has covered αi is measured by 
and i

idf

∑ 
∑ 
 
where idfc is the inverse document frequency of concept c 
an example suppose we have a query how does nurr- delete 
t cells before they migrate to the spleen or lymph nodes and how 
does this impact autoimmunity after identifying the concepts in 
the query we have 
 
 
 nurr- 
 t cells spleen autoimmunity lymph nodes 
v 
v 
 
 
suppose that some document frequencies of different 
combinations of concepts are as follows 
 df nurr- 
 df t cells spleen autoimmunity lymph nodes 
 df t cells spleen autoimmunity 
 df spleen autoimmunity lymph nodes 
 df t cells autoimmunity lymph nodes 
 df t cells spleen lymph nodes 
the weight of vi is then computed by note that there does not exist 
a document having all the concepts in v 
 
 
 log 
 log 
w v n 
w v n 
 
 
 
now suppose a document d contains concepts  nurr- t cells 
 spleen and lymph nodes but not  autoimmunity then the value 
of parameter αi is computed as follows 
 
 
 
 t cells spleen lymph nodes 
 t cells spleen lymph nodes autoimmunity

word similarity 
the similarity between q and d on the word level is computed 
using okapi

hnf and

b are constants dl is the document length of d and avdl is the 
average document length tf is the term frequency of w within d 
the model 
given two documents d and d we say sim q d sim q d or 
d will be ranked higher than d with respect to the same query q 
if either 
 
concept concept 
sim q d sim q d or 
 and 
concept concept word word 
sim q d sim q d sim q d sim q d 
this conceptual ir model emphasizes the similarity on the concept 
level a similar model but applied to non-biomedical domain has 
been given in 
 incorporating domain-specific knowledge 
given a concept c a vector u is derived by incorporating its 
domain-specific knowledge 
 u c u u u 
where u is a vector of its synonyms hyponyms and lexical 
variants u is a vector of its hypernyms and u is a vector of its 
implicitly related concepts an occurrence of any term in u will 
be counted as an occurrence of c idfc in formula is updated as 
 
logc 
c u 
n 
d 
idf 
 c ud is the set of documents having c or any term in u the 
weight that a document d receives from u is given by 
max and tw t u t d∈ ∈ 
where wt β cidf× the weighting factor β is an empirical tuning 
parameter determined as 
 β if t is the original concept its synonym its hyponym or 
its lexical variant 
 β if t is a hypernym 
 β × k-i k if t is an implicitly related concept k is 
the number of selected top ranked implicitly related concepts 
 see section i is the position of t in the ranking of 
implicitly related concepts 
 pseudo-feedback 
pseudo-feedback is a technique commonly used to improve 
retrieval performance by adding new terms into the original query 
we used a modified pseudo-feedback strategy described in 
step let c be the set of concepts in the top ranked 
documents for each concept c in c compute the similarity 
between c and the query q the computation of sim q c can be 
found in 
step the top-k ranked concepts by sim q c are selected 
step associate each selected concept c with the concept cq in 
q that has the same semantic type as c and is most related to 
c among all the concepts in q the association between c and cq 
is computed by 
p 
 log 
p p 
q 
q 
q 
c c 
i c c 
c c 
 
where p x n n n is the number of documents having x and n is 
the size of the document collection a document having c but not 
cq receives a weight given by × k-i k qcidf× where i is the 
position of c in the ranking of step 
 avoid incorrect match of abbreviations 
some gene symbols are very short and thus ambiguous for 
example the gene symbol apc could be the abbreviation for 
many non-gene long-forms such as air pollution control 
aerobic plate count or argon plasma coagulation this step is 
to avoid incorrect match of abbreviations in the top ranked 
documents 
given an abbreviation x with the long-form l in the query we 
scan the top-k ranked k documents and when a document 
is found with x we compare l with all the long-forms of x in that 
document if none of these long-forms is equal or close to l i e 
the edit distance between l and the long-form of x in that 
document is or then the concept similarity of x is subtracted 
 passage extraction 
the goal of passage extraction is to highlight the most relevant 
fragments of text in paragraphs a passage is defined as any span 
of text that does not include the html paragraph tag i e p or 
 p a passage could be a part of a sentence a sentence a set of 
consecutive sentences or a paragraph i e the whole span of text 
that are inside of p and p html tags it is also possible to 
have more than one relevant passage in a single paragraph our 
strategy for passage extraction assumes that the optimal passage s 
in a paragraph should have all the query concepts that the whole 
paragraph has also they should have higher density of query 
concepts than other fragments of text in the paragraph 
suppose we have a query q and a paragraph p represented by a 
sequence of sentences np s s s let c be the set of concepts in 
q that occur in p and s φ 
step for each sequence of consecutive sentences i i js s s ≤ 
i ≤ j ≤ n let s s i i js s s ∪ if i i js s s satisfies that 
 every query concept in c occurs in i i js s s and 
 there does not exist k such that i k j and every query 
concept in c occurs in i i ks s s or k k js s s 
condition requires i i js s s having all the query concepts in p 
and condition requires i i js s s be the minimal 
step let min i i jl j i s s s s − ∈ for every 
 i i js s s in s let i i js s s s s − if j - i l this step is to 
remove those sequences of sentences in s that have lower density 
of query concepts 
step for every two sequences of consecutive 
sentences and i i j i i js s s s s s s s ∈ ∈ if 
 
 
 and 
 
i i j j 
i j 
≤ ≤ 
≤ 
 
then do 
repeat this step until for every two sequences of consecutive 
sentences in s condition does not apply this step is to merge 
those sequences of sentences in s that are adjacent or overlapped 
finally the remaining sequences of sentences in s are returned as 
the optimal passages in the paragraph p with respect to the query

 experimental results 
the evaluation of our techniques and the experimental results are 
given in this section we first describe the datasets and evaluation 
metrics used in our experiments and then present the results 
 data sets and evaluation metrics 
our experiments were performed on the platform of the genomics 
track of trec the document collection contains 
full-text documents from highwire biomedical journals the set 
of queries consists of queries collected from real biologists 
the performance is measured on three different levels passage 
aspect and document to provide better insight on how the 
question is answered from different perspectives passage map 
as described in this is a character-based precision calculated 
as follows at each relevant retrieved passage precision will be 
computed as the fraction of characters overlapping with the gold 
standard passages divided by the total number of characters 
included in all nominated passages from this system for the topic 
up until that point similar to regular map relevant passages that 
were not retrieved will be added into the calculation as well with 
precision set to for relevant passages not retrieved then the 
mean of these average precisions over all topics will be calculated 
to compute the mean average passage precision aspect map a 
question could be addressed from different aspects for example 
the question what is the role of gene prnp in the mad cow 
disease could be answered from aspects like diagnosis 
neurologic manifestations or prions genetics this measure 
indicates how comprehensive the question is answered document 
map this is the standard ir measure the precision is measured 
at every point where a relevant document is obtained and then 
averaged over all relevant documents to obtain the average 
precision for a given query for a set of queries the mean of the 
average precision for all queries is the map of that ir system 
the output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to 
their similarities with the query the performances on the three 
levels are then calculated based on the ranking of the passages 
 results 
the wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to determine the 
statistical significance of the results in the tables of the following 
sections statistically significant improvements at the level 
are marked with an asterisk 
 conceptual ir model vs term-based model 
the initial baseline was established using word similarity only 
computed by the okapi formula another run based on our 
basic conceptual ir model was performed without using query 
expansion pseudo-feedback or abbreviation correction the 
experimental result is shown in table our basic conceptual 
ir model significantly outperforms the okapi on all three levels 
which suggests that although it requires additional efforts to 
identify concepts retrieval on the concept level can achieve 
substantial improvements over purely term-based retrieval model 
 contribution of different types of knowledge 
a series of experiments were performed to examine how each type 
of domain-specific knowledge contributes to the retrieval 
performance a new baseline was established using the basic 
conceptual ir model without incorporating any type of 
domainspecific knowledge then five runs were conducted by adding 
each individual type of domain-specific knowledge we also 
conducted a run by adding all types of domain-specific knowledge 
results of these experiments are shown in table 
we found that any available type of domain-specific 
knowledge improved the performance in passage retrieval the 
biggest improvement comes from the lexical variants which is 
consistent with the result reported in this result also indicates 
that biologists are likely to use different variants of the same 
concept according to their own writing preferences and these 
variants might not be collected in the existing biomedical 
thesauruses it also suggests that the biomedical ir systems can 
benefit from the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the 
literature by text mining systems 
synonyms provided the second biggest improvement 
hypernyms hyponyms and implicitly related concepts provided 
similar degrees of improvement the overall performance is an 
accumulative result of adding different types of domain-specific 
knowledge and it is better than any individual addition it is clearly 
shown that the performance is significantly improved on 
passage level on aspect level and on document 
level when the domain-specific knowledge is appropriately 
incorporated although it is not explicitly shown in table 
different types of domain-specific knowledge affect different 
subsets of queries more specifically each of these types with the 
exception of the lexical variants which affects a large number of 
queries affects only a few queries but for those affected queries 
their improvement is significant as a consequence the 
accumulative improvement is very significant 
 pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction 
using the baseline all in table as a new baseline the 
contribution of abbreviation correction and pseudo-feedback is 
given in table there is little improvement by avoiding 
incorrect matching of abbreviations the pseudo-feedback 
contributed about improvement in passage retrieval 
 performance compared with best-reported results 
we compared our result with the results reported in the genomics 
track of trec on the conditions that systems are 
automatic systems and passages are extracted from paragraphs 
the performance of our system relative to the best reported results 
is shown in table in trec some systems returned the 
whole paragraphs as passages as a consequence excellent 
retrieval results were obtained on document and aspect levels at 
the expense of performance on the passage level we do not 
include the results of such systems here 
table performance compared with best-reported results 
passage map aspect map document map 
best reported results 
our results 
improvement 
the best reported results in the first row of table on three 
levels passage aspect and document are from different systems 
our result is from a single run on passage retrieval in which it is 
better than the best reported result by in passage retrieval 
and at the same time better in aspect retrieval and 
better in document retrieval since the average precision of each 
individual query was not reported we can not apply the wilcoxon 
signed-rank test to calculate the significance of difference between 
our performance and the best reported result

a separate experiment has been done using a second testbed the 
ad-hoc task of trec genomics to evaluate our 
knowledge-intensive conceptual ir model for document retrieval 
of biomedical literature the overall performance in terms of map 
is which is about above the best reported result 
 notice that the performance was only measured on the 
document level for the ad-hoc task of trec genomics 
 related works 
many studies used manually-crafted thesauruses or knowledge 
databases created by text mining systems to improve retrieval 
effectiveness based on either word-statistical retrieval systems or 
conceptual retrieval systems 
 assessed query expansion using the umls 
metathesaurus based on a word-statistical retrieval system 
used definitions and different types of thesaurus relationships for 
query expansion and a deteriorated performance was reported 
expanded queries with phrases and umls concepts determined by 
the metamap a program which maps biomedical text to umls 
concepts and no significant improvement was shown we used 
mesh entrez gene and other non-thesaurus knowledge resources 
such as an abbreviation database for query expansion a critical 
difference between our work and those in is that our 
retrieval model is based on concepts not on individual words 
the genomics track in trec provides a common platform to 
evaluate methods and techniques proposed by various groups for 
biomedical information retrieval as summarized in 
many groups utilized domain-specific knowledge to improve 
retrieval effectiveness among these groups assessed both 
thesaurus-based knowledge such as gene information and non 
thesaurus-based knowledge such as lexical variants of gene 
symbols for query expansion they have shown that query 
expansion with acronyms and lexical variants of gene symbols 
produced the biggest improvement whereas the query expansion 
with gene information from gene databases deteriorated the 
performance used a similar approach for generating lexical 
variants of gene symbols and reported significant improvements 
our system utilized more types of domain-specific knowledge 
including hyponyms hypernyms and implicitly related concepts 
in addition under the conceptual retrieval framework we 
examined more comprehensively the effects of different types of 
domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution 
 utilized wordnet a database of english words and 
their lexical relationships developed by princeton university for 
query expansion in the non-biomedical domain in their studies 
queries were expanded using the lexical semantic relations such as 
synonyms hypernyms or hyponyms little benefit has been 
shown in this has been due to ambiguity of the query terms 
which have different meanings in different contexts when these 
synonyms having multiple meanings are added to the query 
substantial irrelevant documents are retrieved in the biomedical 
domain this kind of ambiguity of query terms is relatively less 
frequent because although the abbreviations are highly 
ambiguous general biomedical concepts usually have only one 
meaning in the thesaurus such as umls whereas a term in 
wordnet usually have multiple meanings represented as synsets 
in wordnet besides we have implemented a post-ranking step 
to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations which 
will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the 
abbreviation ambiguity besides we have implemented a 
postranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of 
abbreviations which will hopefully decrease the negative impact 
caused by the abbreviation ambiguity the retrieval model in 
emphasized the similarity between a query and a document on the 
phrase level assuming that phrases are more important than 
individual words when retrieving documents although the 
assumption is similar our conceptual model is based on the 
biomedical concepts not phrases 
 presented a good study of the role of knowledge in the 
document retrieval of clinical medicine they have shown that 
appropriate use of semantic knowledge in a conceptual retrieval 
framework can yield substantial improvements although the 
retrieval model is similar we made a study in the domain of 
genomics in which the problem structure and task knowledge is 
not as well-defined as in the domain of clinical medicine 
also our similarity function is very different from that in 
in summary our approach differs from previous works in four 
important ways first we present a case study of conceptual 
retrieval in the domain of genomics where many knowledge 
resources can be used to improve the performance of biomedical 
ir systems second we have studied more types of 
domainspecific knowledge than previous researchers and carried out more 
comprehensive experiments to look into the effects of different 
types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution 
third although some of the techniques seem similar to previously 
published ones they are actually quite different in details for 
example in our pseudo-feedback process we require that the unit 
of feedback is a concept and the concept has to be of the same 
semantic type as a query concept this is to ensure that our 
conceptual model of retrieval can be applied as another example 
the way in which implicitly related concepts are extracted in this 
paper is significantly different from that given in finally our 
conceptual ir model is actually based on complex concepts 
because some biomedical meanings such as biological processes 
are represented by multiple simple concepts 
 conclusion 
this paper proposed a conceptual approach to utilize 
domainspecific knowledge in an ir system to improve its effectiveness in 
retrieving biomedical literature we specified five different types 
of domain-specific knowledge i e synonyms hyponyms 
hypernyms lexical variants and implicitly related concepts and 
examined their effects in performance contribution we also 
evaluated other two techniques pseudo-feedback and abbreviation 
correction experimental results have shown that appropriate use 
of domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual ir model yields 
significant improvements in passage retrieval over the best 
known results in our future work we will explore the use of other 
existing knowledge resources such as umls and the wikipedia 
and evaluate techniques such as disambiguation of gene symbols 
for improving retrieval effectiveness the application of our 
conceptual ir model in other domains such as clinical medicine 
will be investigated
