 introduction 
solutions for integrating heterogeneous idss intrusion detection 
systems have been proposed by several groups 
some reasons for integrating idss are described by the idwg 
 intrusion detection working group from the ietf internet 
engineering task force as follows 
 many idss available in the market have strong and weak 
points which generally make necessary the deployment of 
more than one ids to provided an adequate solution 
 attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple 
networks spanning several administrative domains these 
domains usually utilize different idss the integration of 
idss is then needed to correlate information from multiple 
networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and 
or intrusions 
 the interoperability integration of different ids components 
would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed 
up the deployment of idss as commercial products 
didss distributed intrusion detection systems therefore started 
to emerge in early s to allow the correlation of intrusion 
information from multiple hosts networks or domains to detect 
distributed attacks research on didss has then received much 
interest mainly because centralised idss are not able to provide 
the information needed to prevent such attacks 
however the realization of a dids requires a high degree of 
coordination computational grids are appealing as they enable 
the development of distributed application and coordination in a 
distributed environment grid computing aims to enable 
coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals 
and or organizations moreover grid middleware provides means 
for secure access management and allocation of remote resources 
resource information services and protocols and mechanisms for 
transfer of data 
according to foster et al grids can be viewed as a set of 
aggregate services defined by the resources that they share ogsa 
 open grid service architecture provides the foundation for this 
service orientation in computational grids the services in ogsa 
are specified through well-defined open extensible and 
platformindependent interfaces which enable the development of 
interoperable applications 
this article proposes a model for integration of idss by using 
computational grids the proposed model enables heterogeneous 
idss to work in a cooperative way this integration is termed 
didsog distributed intrusion detection system on grid each 
of the integrated idss is viewed by others as a resource accessed 
through the services that it exposes a grid middleware provides 
several features for the realization of a didsog including 
decentralized coordination of resources use of standard protocols 
and interfaces and the delivery of optimized qos quality of 
service 
the service oriented architecture followed by grids ogsa 
allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different 
platforms different implementations can be encapsulated by a 
service interface this virtualisation allows the consistent access to 
resources in heterogeneous environments the virtualisation of 
the environment through service interfaces allows the use of 
services without the knowledge of how they are actually 
implemented this characteristic is important for the integration 
of idss as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different 
idss 
grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of 
services some functions provided by grid middleware are i 
data management services including access services replication 
and localisation ii workflow services that implement coordinate 
execution of multiple applications on multiple resources iii 
auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or 
intrusions iv monitoring services which implement the 
discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate 
alerts under determined conditions v services for identification 
of problems in a distributed environment which implement the 
correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs 
these services are important for the implementation of a didsog 
a dids needs services for the location of and access to 
distributed data from different idss auditing and monitoring 
services take care of the proper needs of the didss such as 
secure storage data analysis to detect intrusions discovery of 
distributed sensors and sending of alerts the correlation of 
distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of 
distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert 
information generated by the different idss that compose the 
didsog 
the next sections of this article are organized as follows section 
 presents related work the proposed model is presented in 
section section describes the development and a case study 
results and discussion are presented in section conclusions 
and future work are discussed in section 
 related work 
didma is a flexible scalable reliable and 
platformindependent dids didma architecture allows distributed 
analysis of events and can be easily extended by developing new 
agents however the integration with existing idss and the 
development of security components are presented as future work 
 the extensibility of dids didma and the integration with 
other idss are goals pursued by didsog the flexibility 
scalability platform independence reliability and security 
components discussed in are achieved in didsog by using a 
grid platform 
more efficient techniques for analysis of great amounts of data in 
wide scale networks based on clustering and applicable to didss 
are presented in the integration of heterogeneous idss to 
increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the 
environment is mentioned as future work didsog thus aims 
at integrating heterogeneous idss 
ref presents a hierarchical architecture for a dids 
information is collected aggregated correlated and analysed as it 
is sent up in the hierarchy the architecture comprises of several 
components for monitoring correlation intrusion detection by 
statistics detection by signatures and answers components in the 
same level of the hierarchy cooperate with one another the 
integration proposed by didsog also follows a hierarchical 
architecture each ids integrated to the didsog offers 
functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests 
functionalities from idss from another level the hierarchy 
presented in integrates homogeneous idss whereas the 
hierarchical architecture of didsog integrates heterogeneous 
idss 
there are proposals on integrating computational grids and idss 
 ref and propose the use of globus 
toolkit for intrusion detection especially for dos denial of 
service and ddos distributed denial of service attacks 
globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to 
detect these kinds of attack a two-phase processing architecture 
is presented the first phase aims at the detection of momentary 
attacks while the second phase is concerned with chronic or 
perennial attacks 
traditional idss or didss are generally coordinated by a central 
point a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks leu et al 
 point out that idss developed upon grids platforms are less 
vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such 
platforms leu et al have used tools to generate several 
types of attacks - including tcp icmp and udp flooding - and 
have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of 
applying computational grids to idss 
this work proposes the development of a dids upon a grid 
platform however the resulting dids integrates heterogeneous 
idss whereas the didss upon grids presented by leu et al 
 do not consider the integration of heterogeneous idss the 
processing in phases is also contemplated by didsog 
which is enabled by the specification of several levels of 
processing allowed by the integration of heterogeneous idss 
the dids gida grid intrusion detection architecture targets 
at the detection of intrusions in a grid environment gridsim 
grid simulator was used for the validation of dids gida 
homogeneous resources were used to simplify the development 
 however the possibility of applying heterogeneous 
detection systems is left for future work 
another dids for grids is presented by choon and samsudim 
 scenarios demonstrating how a dids can execute on a grid 
environment are presented 
didsog does not aim at detecting intrusions in a grid 
environment in contrast didsog uses the grid to compose a 
dids by integrating specific idss the resulting dids could 
however be used to identify attacks in a grid environment local 
and distributed attacks can be detected through the integration of 
traditional idss while attacks particular to grids can be detected 
through the integration of grid idss 
 the proposed model 
didsog presents a hierarchy of intrusion detection services this 
hierarchy is organized through a two-dimensional vector defined 
by scope complexity the idss composing didsog can be 
organized in different levels of scope or complexity depending on 
its functionalities the topology of the target environment and 
expected results 
figure presents a didsog composed by different intrusion 
detection services i e data gathering data aggregation data 
correlation analysis intrusion response and management 
provided by different idss the information flow and the 
relationship between the levels of scope and complexity are 
presented in this figure 
information about the environment host network or application 
is collected by sensors located both in user s and user s 
computers in domain the information is sent to both simple 
analysers that act on the information from a single host level 
 and to aggregation and correlation services that act on 
information from multiple hosts from the same domain level 
simple analysers in the first scope level send the information to 
more complex analysers in the next levels of complexity level 
n when an analyser detects an intrusion it communicates with 
countermeasure and monitoring services registered to its scope 
an analyser can invoke a countermeasure service that replies to a 
detected attack or informs a monitoring service about the 
ongoing attack so the administrator can act accordingly 
aggregation and correlation resources in the second scope receive 
information from sensors from different users computers user 
 s and user s in the domain these resources process the 
received information and send it to the analysis resources 
registered to the first level of complexity in the second scope 
 level the information is also sent to the aggregation and 
correlation resources registered in the first level of complexity in

fig how didsog works 
the analysis resources in the second scope act like the analysis 
resources in the first scope directing the information to a more 
complex analysis resource and putting the countermeasure and 
monitoring resources in action in case of detected attacks 
aggregation and correlation resources in the third scope receive 
information from domains and these resources then carry out 
the aggregation and correlation of the information from different 
domains and send it to the analysis resources in the first level of 
complexity in the third scope level the information could 
also be sent to the aggregate service in the next scope in case of 
any resources registered to such level 
the analysis resources in the third scope act similar to the analysis 
resources in the first and second scopes except that the analysis 
resources in the third scope act on information from multiple 
domains 
the functionalities of the registered resources in each of the 
scopes and complexity level can vary from one environment to 
another the model allows the development of n levels of scope 
and complexity 
figure presents the architecture of a resource participating in the 
didsog initially the resource registers itself to gis grid 
information service so other participating resources can query 
the services provided after registering itself the resource 
requests information about other intrusion detection resources 
registered to the gis 
a given resource of didsog interacts with other resources by 
receiving data from the source resources processing it and 
sending the results to the destination resources therefore

received from the origin resources and generates new data to be 
sent to the destination resources a native ids component can 
be any tool processes information related to intrusion detection 
including analysis data gathering data aggregation data

targetresources class represents the features of the destination 
resources of a determined resource this class aggregates 
resource the resource class identifies the characteristics of a 
destination resource this identification is made through the 
featuretype attribute and the level and datatype classes 
a given resource analyses the information from descriptors from 
other resources and compares this information with the 
information specified in targetresources to know to which 
resources to send the results of its processing 
the base component is responsible for the communication of a 
resource with other resources of the didsog and with the grid 
information service it is this component that registers the 
resource and the queries other resources in the gis 
the connector component is the link between base and native 
ids the information that base receives from origin resources is 
passed to connector component the connector component 
performs the necessary changes in the data so that it is understood 
by native ids and sends this data to native ids for processing 
the connector component also has the responsibility of collecting 
the information processed by native ids and making the 
necessary changes so the information can pass through the 
didsog again after these changes connector sends the 
information to the base which in turn sends it to the destination 
resources in accordance with the specifications of the descriptor 
component 
 implementation 
we have used gridsim toolkit for development and 
evaluation of the proposed model we have used and extended 
gridsim features to model and simulate the resources and 
components of didsog

the simulation user class represents a user of didsog this 
class function is to initiate the processing of a resource sensor 
from where the gathered information will be sent to other 
resources didsog gis keeps a registry of the didsog 
resources the didsog baseresource class implements the base 
component see figure didsog baseresource interacts with

a connector component must be developed for each native ids 
integrated to didsog the connector component is implemented 
by creating a class derived from didsog baseresource the new 
class will implement new functionalities in accordance with the 
needs of the corresponding native ids 
in the simulation environment data collection resources analysis 
aggregation correlation and generation of answers were 
integrated classes were developed to simulate the processing of 
each native ids components associated to the resources for each 
simulated native ids a class derived from 
didsog baseresource was developed this class corresponds to 
the connector component of the native ids and aims at the 
integrating the ids to didsog 
a xml file describing each of the integrated resources is chosen 
by using the connector component the resulting relationship 
between the resources integrated to the didsog in accordance 
with the specification of its respective descriptors is presented in

fig flow of the execution of the simulation 
the native ids of analyser generates alerts for any attempt of 
connection to port the data received from analyser had 
presented such features generating an idmef intrusion 
detection message exchange format alert the generated 
alert was sent to countermeasure resource where a warning 
was dispatched to the administrator informing him of the alert 
received 
the aggreg corr resource received the information generated 
by sensors and its processing activities consist in correlating 
the source ip addresses with the received data the resultant 
information of the processing of aggreg corr was directed to 
the analyser resource 
the native ids component of the analyser generates alerts 
when a source tries to connect to the same port number of 
multiple destinations this situation is identified by the 
analyser in the data received from aggreg corr and an alert 
in idmef format is then sent to the countermeasures resource 
in addition to generating alerts in idmef format analyser also 
directs the received data to the analyser in the level of 
complexity the native ids component of analyser 
generates alerts when the transmission of icmp messages from a 
given source to multiple destinations is detected this situation is 
detected in the data received from analyser and an idmef 
alert is then sent to the countermeasure resource 
the countermeasure resource receives the alerts generated by 
analysers and in accordance with the implementation of its 
native ids component warnings on alerts received are 
dispatched to the administrator 
the simulation carried out demonstrates how didsog works 
simulated data was generated to be the input for a grid of 
intrusion detection systems composed by several distinct 
resources the resources carry out tasks such as data collection 
aggregation and analysis and generation of alerts and warnings in 
an integrated manner 
 experiment results 
the hierarchic organization of scope and complexity provides a 
high degree of flexibility to the model the didsog can be 
modelled in accordance with the needs of each environment the 
descriptors define data flow desired for the resulting dids 
each native ids is integrated to the didsog through a 
connector component the connector component is also flexible 
in the didsog adaptations conversions of data types and 
auxiliary processes that native idss need are provided by the 
connector filters and generation of specific logs for each native 
ids or environment can also be incorporated to the connector 
if the integration of a new ids to an environment already 
configured is desired it is enough to develop the connector for 
the desired ids and to specify the resource descriptor after the 
specification of the connector and the descriptor the new ids is 
integrated to the didsog 
through the definition of scopes resources can act on data of 
different source groups for example scope can be related to a 
given set of hosts scope to another set of hosts while scope 
can be related to hosts from scopes and scopes can be defined 
according to the needs of each environment 
the complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing 
between several resources inside the same scope in an analysis 
task for example the search for simple attacks can be made by 
resources of complexity whereas the search for more complex 
attacks that demands more time can be performed by resources 
of complexity with this the analysis of the data is made by two 
resources 
the distinction between complexity levels can also be organized 
in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection 
the complexity level could be defined for analyses based on 
signatures which are simpler techniques the complexity level 
for techniques based on behaviour that require greater 
computational power and the complexity level for intrusion 
detection in applications where the techniques are more specific 
and depend on more data 
the division of scopes and the complexity levels make the 
processing of the data to be carried out in phases no resource has 
full knowledge about the complete data processing flow each 
resource only knows the results of its processing and the 
destination to which it sends the results resources of higher 
complexity must be linked to resources of lower complexity 
therefore the hierarchic structure of the didsog is maintained 
facilitating its extension and integration with other domains of 
intrusion detection 
by carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several 
chosen analysers for an environment the sensor resource is not 
overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers an 
initial analyser will exist complexity level to which the sensor 
will send its data and this analyser will then direct the data to the 
next step of the processing flow another feature of the 
hierarchical organization is the easy extension and integration 
with other domains if it is necessary to add a new host sensor to 
the didsog it is enough to plug it to the first hierarchy of 
resources if it is necessary to add a new analyser it will be in the 
scope of several domains it is enough to relate it to another 
resource of same scope 
the didsog allows different levels to be managed by different 
entities for example the first scope can be managed by the local 
user of a host the second scope comprising several hosts of a 
domain can be managed by the administrator of the domain a 
third entity can be responsible for managing the security of 
several domains in a joint way this entity can act in the scope 
independently from others 
with the proposed model for integration of idss in grids the 
different idss of an environment or multiple idss integrated act 
in a cooperative manner improving the intrusion detection 
services mainly in two aspects first the information from 
multiple sources are analysed in an integrated way to search for 
distributed attacks this integration can be made under several 
scopes second there is a great diversity of data aggregation 
techniques data correlation and analysis and intrusion response 
that can be applied to the same environment these techniques can 
be organized under several levels of complexity 
 conclusion 
the integration of heterogeneous idss is important however the 
incompatibility and diversity of ids solutions make such 
integration extremely difficult this work thus proposed a model 
for composition of dids by integrating existing idss on a 
computational grid platform didsog idss in didsog are 
encapsulated as grid services for intrusion detection a 
computational grid platform is used for the integration by 
providing the basic requirements for communication localization 
resource sharing and security mechanisms 
the components of the architecture of the didsog were 
developed and evaluated using the gridsim grid simulator 
services for communication and localization were used to carry 
out the integration between components of different resources 
based on the components of the architecture several resources 
were modelled forming a grid of intrusion detection the 
simulation demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed model 
data from the sensor resources was read and this data was used to 
feed other resources of didsog 
the integration of distinct idss could be observed through the 
simulated environment resources providing different intrusion 
detection services were integrated e g analysis correlation 
aggregation and alert the communication and localization 
services provided by gridsim were used to integrate components 
of different resources various resources were modelled following 
the architecture components forming a grid of intrusion detection 
the components of didsog architecture have served as base for 
the integration of the resources presented in the simulation 
during the simulation the different idss cooperated with one 
another in a distributed manner however in a coordinated way 
with an integrated view of the events having thus the capability 
to detect distributed attacks this capability demonstrates that the 
idss integrated have resulted in a dids 
related work presents cooperation between components of a 
specific dids some work focus on either the development of 
didss on computational grids or the application of idss to 
computational grids however none deals with the integration of 
heterogeneous idss in contrast the proposed model developed 
and simulated in this work can shed some light into the question 
of integration of heterogeneous idss 
didsog presents new research opportunities that we would like 
to pursue including deployment of the model in a more realistic 
environment such as a grid incorporation of new security 
services parallel analysis of data by native idss in multiple 
hosts 
in addition to the integration of idss enabled by a grid 
middleware the cooperation of heterogeneous idss can be 
viewed as an economic problem idss from different 
organizations or administrative domains need incentives for 
joining a grid of intrusion detection services and for collaborating 
with other idss the development of distributed strategy proof 
mechanisms for integration of idss is a challenge that we would 
like to tackle
