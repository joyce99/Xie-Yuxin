abstract 
it is well established by conflict theorists and others that successful 
negotiation should incorporate creating value as well as 
claiming value joint improvements that bring benefits to all parties 
can be realised by i identifying attributes that are not of direct 
conflict between the parties ii tradeoffs on attributes that are 
valued differently by different parties and iii searching for values 
within attributes that could bring more gains to one party while not 
incurring too much loss on the other party in this paper we 
propose an approach for maximising joint gains in automated 
negotiations by formulating the negotiation problem as a multi-criteria 
decision making problem and taking advantage of several 
optimisation techniques introduced by operations researchers and conflict 
theorists we use a mediator to protect the negotiating parties from 
unnecessary disclosure of information to their opponent while also 
allowing an objective calculation of maximum joint gains we 
separate out attributes that take a finite set of values simple attributes 
from those with continuous values and we show that for simple 
attributes the mediator can determine the pareto-optimal values 
in addition we show that if none of the simple attributes strongly 
dominates the other simple attributes then truth telling is an 
equilibrium strategy for negotiators during the optimisation of simple 
attributes we also describe an approach for improving joint gains 
on non-simple attributes by moving the parties in a series of steps 
towards the pareto-optimal frontier

 introduction 
given that negotiation is perhaps one of the oldest activities in 
the history of human communication it s perhaps surprising that 
conducted experiments on negotiations have shown that negotiators 
more often than not reach inefficient compromises raiffa 
 and sebenius provide analyses on the negotiators failure 
to achieve efficient agreements in practice and their unwillingness 
to disclose private information due to strategic reasons according 
to conflict theorists lax and sebenius most negotiation 
actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which 
they refer to as creating value and claiming value they argue 
that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and 
competitive elements and that these elements exist in tension negotiators 
face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a 
competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation they 
refer to this problem as the negotiator s dilemma 
we argue that the negotiator s dilemma is essentially 
informationbased due to the private information held by the agents such 
private information contains both the information that implies the 
agent s bottom lines or her walk-away positions and the 
information that enforces her bargaining strength for instance when 
bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer the seller would 
try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she 
hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her 
reserve price on the other hand the outside options available to her 
 e g other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly 
good offers consist in the information that improves her 
bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent 
but at the same time her opponent is well aware of the fact that it 
is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not 
accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by 
evidence 
coming back to the negotiator s dilemma it s not always 
possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the 
distributive bargaining process in fact more often than not the two 
processes interplay with each other making information manipulation 
become part of the integrative bargaining process this is because a 
negotiator could use the information about his opponent s interests 
against her during the distributive negotiation process that is a 
negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue 
by claiming that he has made a major concession on another 
issue to meet his opponent s interests even though the concession he 
made could be insignificant to him for instance few buyers would 
start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer 
by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for 
the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an 
extended warranty

agents nsas have been introduced either to assist humans in 
making decisions or to enable automated negotiation to allow 
computer processes to engage in meaningful negotiation to reach 
agreements see for instance however because of 
the negotiator s dilemma and given even bargaining power and 
incomplete information the following two undesirable situations 
often arise i negotiators reach inefficient compromises or ii 
negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both 
negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same 
time do not want to disclose more information 
in this paper we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the 
above two issues the mediator thus plays two roles in a 
negotiation i to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators 
and ii to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to 
prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information 
as a strategic device to take advantage of existing results in 
negotiation analysis and operations research or literatures we 
employ multi-criteria decision making mcdm theory to allow 
the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed section 
provides background on mcdm theory and the negotiation 
framework section formulates the problem in section we discuss 
our approach to integrative negotiation section discusses the 
future work with some concluding remarks 
 background 
 multi-criteria decision making theory 
let a denote the set of feasible alternatives available to a 
decision maker m as an act or decision a in a may involve 
multiple aspects we usually describe the alternatives a with a set of 
attributes j j m attributes are also referred to as 
issues or decision variables a typical decision maker also has 
several objectives x xk we assume that xi i k 
maps the alternatives to real numbers thus a tuple x xk 
 x a xk a denotes the consequence of the act a to the 
decision maker m by definition objectives are statements that 
delineate the desires of a decision maker thus m wishes to 
maximise his objectives however as discussed thoroughly by keeney 
and raiffa it is quite likely that a decision maker s objectives 
will conflict with each other in that the improved achievement with 
one objective can only be accomplished at the expense of another 
for instance most businesses and public services have objectives 
like minimise cost and maximise the quality of services since 
better services can often only be attained for a price these 
objectives conflict 
due to the conflicting nature of a decision maker s objectives m 
usually has to settle at a compromise solution that is he may have 
to choose an act a ∈ a that does not optimise every objective this 
is the topic of the multi-criteria decision making theory part of the 
solution to this problem is that m has to try to identify the pareto 
frontier in the consequence space x a xk a a∈a 
definition dominant 
let x x xk and x x xk be two 
consequences x dominates x iff xi xi for all i and the inequality is 
strict for at least one i 
the pareto frontier in a consequence space then consists of all 
consequences that are not dominated by any other consequence 
this is illustrated in fig in which an alternative consists of two 
attributes d and d and the decision maker tries to maximise the 
two objectives x and x a decision a ∈ a whose consequence 
does not lie on the pareto frontier is inefficient while the pareto

optimal consequenc 
figure the pareto frontier 
frontier allows m to avoid taking inefficient decisions m still has 
to decide which of the efficient consequences on the pareto frontier 
is most preferred by him 
mcdm theorists introduce a mechanism to allow the objective 
components of consequences to be normalised to the payoff 
valuations for the objectives consequences can then be ordered if the 
gains in satisfaction brought about by c in comparison to c 
equals to the losses in satisfaction brought about by c in 
comparison to c then the two consequences c and c are considered 
indifferent m can now construct the set of indifference curves 
in 
the consequence space the dashed curves in fig the most 
preferred indifference curve that intersects with the pareto frontier is 
in focus its intersection with the pareto frontier is the sought after 
consequence i e the optimal consequence in fig 
 a negotiation framework 
a multi-agent negotiation framework consists of 
 a set of two negotiating agents n 
 a set of attributes att α αm characterising the 
issues the agents are negotiating over each attribute α can take a 
value from the set v alα 
 a set of alternative outcomes o an outcome o ∈ o is 
represented by an assignment of values to the corresponding attributes 
in att 
 agents utility based on the theory of multiple-criteria decision 
making we define the agents utility as follows 
 objectives agent i has a set of ni objectives or interests 
denoted by j j ni to measure how much an 
outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i we use objective 
functions for each agent i we define i s interests using the 
objective vector function fi fij o → rni 
 
 value functions instead of directly evaluating an outcome o 
agent i looks at how much his objectives are fulfilled and will 
make a valuation based on these more basic criteria thus 
for each agent i there is a value function σi rni 
→ r 
in particular raiffa shows how to systematically 
construct an additive value function to each party involved in a 
negotiation 
 utility now given an outcome o ∈ o an agent i is able 
to determine its value i e σi fi o however a 
negotiation infrastructure is usually required to facilitate negotiation 
this might involve other mechanisms and factors parties e g 
a mediator a legal institution participation fees etc the 
standard way to implement such a thing is to allow money 
 
in fact given the k-dimensional space these should be called 
indifference surfaces however we will not bog down to that level of 
details 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
and side-payments in this paper we ignore those side-effects 
and assume that agent i s utility function ui is normalised so 
that ui o → 
example there are two agents a and b agent a has 
a task t that needs to be done and also units of a resource 
r agent b has the capacity to perform task t and would like to 
obtain at least and at most units of the resource r agent b is 
indifferent on any amount between and units of the resource 
r the objective functions for both agents a and b are cost and 
revenue and they both aim at minimising costs while maximising 
revenues having t done generates for a a revenue ra t while 
doing t incurs a cost cb t to b agent b obtains a revenue rb r 
for each unit of the resource r while providing each unit of the 
resource r costs agent a ca r 
assuming that money transfer between agents is possible the set 
att then contains three attributes 
 t taking values from the set indicates whether the 
task t is assigned to agent b 
 r taking values from the set of non-negative integer 
indicates the amount of resource r being allocated to agent b 
and 
 mt taking values from r indicates the payment p to be 
transferred from a to b 
consider the outcome o t r k mt p i e the 
task t is assigned to b and a allocates to b with k units of the 
resource r and a transfers p dollars to b then costa o 
k ca r p and reva o ra t and costb o cb t and 
reva o 
j 
k rb r p if ≤ k ≤ 
p otherwise 
and σi costi o revi o revi o − costi o i a b 
 problem formalisation 
consider example assume that ra t and cb t 
 and rb r and ca r that is the revenues 
generated for a exceeds the costs incurred to b to do task t and b 
values resource r more highly than the cost for a to provide it 
the optimal solution to this problem scenario is to assign task t to 
agent b and to allocate units of resource r i e the maximal 
amount of resource r required by agent b from agent a to agent 
b this outcome regarding the resource and task allocation 
problems leaves payoffs of to agent a and to agent b 
any 
other outcome would leave at least one of the agents worse off in 
other words the presented outcome is pareto-efficient and should 
be part of the solution outcome for this problem scenario 
however as the agents still have to bargain over the amount of 
money transfer p neither agent would be willing to disclose their 
respective costs and revenues regarding the task t and the resource 
r as a consequence agents often do not achieve the optimal 
outcome presented above in practice to address this issue we 
introduce a mediator to help the agents discover better agreements than 
the ones they might try to settle on note that this problem is 
essentially the problem of searching for joint gains in a multilateral 
negotiation in which the involved parties hold strategic information 
i e the integrative part in a negotiation in order to help facilitate 
this process we introduce the role of a neutral mediator before 
formalising the decision problems faced by the mediator and the 
 
certainly without money transfer to compensate agent a this 
outcome is not a fair one 
negotiating agents we discuss the properties of the solution 
outcomes to be achieved by the mediator in a negotiation setting the 
two typical design goals would be 
 efficiency avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that 
is not pareto-optimal and 
 fairness avoid agreements that give the most of the gains 
to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little 
the above goals are axiomatised in nash s seminal work on 
cooperative negotiation games essentially nash advocates for the 
following properties to be satisfied by solution to the bilateral 
negotiation problem i it produces only pareto-optimal outcomes ii 
it is invariant to affine transformation to the consequence space 
 iii it is symmetric and iv it is independent from irrelevant 
alternatives a solution satisfying nash s axioms is called a nash 
bargaining solution 
it then turns out that by taking the negotiators utilities as its 
objectives the mediator itself faces a multi-criteria decision making 
problem the issues faced by the mediator are i the mediator 
requires access to the negotiators utility functions and ii 
making fair tradeoffs between different agents utilities our methods 
allow the agents to repeatedly interact with the mediator so that a 
nash solution outcome could be found by the parties 
informally the problem faced by both the mediator and the 
negotiators is construction of the indifference curves why are the 
indifference curves so important 
 to the negotiators knowing the options available along 
indifference curves opens up opportunities to reach more 
efficient outcomes for instance consider an agent a who is 
presenting his opponent with an offer θa which she refuses 
to accept rather than having to concede a could look at 
his indifference curve going through θa and choose another 
proposal θa to him θa and θa are indifferent but θa could 
give some gains to b and thus will be more acceptable to b 
in other words the outcome θa is more efficient than θa to 
these two negotiators 
 to the mediator constructing indifference curves requires a 
measure of fairness between the negotiators the mediator 
needs to determine how much utility it needs to take away 
from the other negotiators to give a particular negotiator a 
specific gain g in utility 
in order to search for integrative solutions within the outcome 
space o we characterise the relationship between the agents over 
the set of attributes att as the agents hold different objectives and 
have different capacities it may be the case that changing between 
two values of a specific attribute implies different shifts in utility 
of the agents however the problem of finding the exact 
paretooptimal set 
is np-hard 
our approach is thus to solve this optimisation problem in two 
steps in the first steps the more manageable attributes will be 
solved these are attributes that take a finite set of values the 
result of this step would be a subset of outcomes that contains the 
pareto-optimal set in the second step we employ an iterative 
procedure that allows the mediator to interact with the negotiators to 
find joint improvements that move towards a pareto-optimal 
outcome this approach will not work unless the attributes from att 
 
the pareto-optimal set is the set of outcomes whose consequences 
 in the consequence space correspond to the pareto frontier 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
are independent most works on multi-attribute or multi-issue 
negotiation e g assume that the attributes or the issues are 
independent resulting in an additive value function for each agent 
assumption let i ∈ n and s ⊆ att denote by ¯s the 
set att \ s assume that vs and vs are two assignments of values 
to the attributes of s and v 
¯s v 
¯s are two arbitrary value 
assignments to the attributes of ¯s then ui vs v 
¯s − ui vs v 
¯s 
 ui vs v 
¯s −ui vs v 
¯s that is the utility function of agent i 
will be defined on the attributes from s independently of any value 
assignment to other attributes 
 mediator-based bilateral 
negotiations 
as discussed by lax and sebenius under incomplete 
information the tension between creating and claiming values is the 
primary cause of inefficient outcomes this can be seen most 
easily in negotiations involving two negotiators during the 
distributive phase of the negotiation the two negotiators s objectives are 
directly opposing each other we will now formally characterise 
this relationship between negotiators by defining the opposition 
between two negotiating parties the following exposition will be 
mainly reproduced from 
assuming for the moment that all attributes from att take values 
from the set of real numbers r i e v alj ⊆ r for all j ∈ att we 
further assume that the set o ×j∈attv alj of feasible outcomes 
is defined by constraints that all parties must obey and o is convex 
now an outcome o ∈ o is just a point in the m-dimensional space 
of real numbers then the questions are i from the point of view 
of an agent i is o already the best outcome for i ii if o is not 
the best outcome for i then is there another outcome o such that o 
gives i a better utility than o and o does not cause a utility loss to 
the other agent j in comparison to o 
the above questions can be answered by looking at the directions 
of improvement of the negotiating parties at o i e the directions 
in the outcome space o into which their utilities increase at point 
o under the assumption that the parties utility functions ui are 
differentiable concave the set of all directions of improvement for 
a party at a point o can be defined in terms of his most preferred 
or gradient direction at that point when the gradient direction 
∇ui o of agent i at point o is outright opposing to the gradient 
direction ∇uj o of agent j at point o then the two parties strongly 
disagree at o and no joint improvements can be achieved for i and 
j in the locality surrounding o 
since opposition between the two parties can vary considerably 
over the outcome space with one pair of outcomes considered 
highly antagonistic and another pair being highly cooperative we 
need to describe the local properties of the relationship we begin 
with the opposition at any point of the outcome space rm 
 the 
following definition is reproduced from 
definition the parties are in local strict opposition 
at a point x ∈ rm 
iff for all points x ∈ rm 
that are 
sufficiently close to x i e for some such that 
∀x x −x an increase of one utility can be achieved 
only at the expense of a decrease of the other utility 
 the parties are in local non-strict opposition at a point x ∈ 
rm 
iff they are not in local strict opposition at x i e iff it is 
possible for both parties to raise their utilities by moving an 
infinitesimal distance from x 
 
klein et al explore several implications of complex contracts 
in which attributes are possibly inter-dependent 
 the parties are in local weak opposition at a point x ∈ rm 
iff ∇u x ∇u x ≥ i e iff the gradients at x of the two 
utility functions form an acute or right angle 
 the parties are in local strong opposition at a point x ∈ rm 
iff ∇u x ∇u x i e iff the gradients at x form an 
obtuse angle 
 the parties are in global strict nonstrict weak strong 
opposition iff for every x ∈ rm 
they are in local strict 
 nonstrict weak strong opposition 
global strict and nonstrict oppositions are complementary cases 
essentially under global strict opposition the whole outcome space 
o becomes the pareto-optimal set as at no point in o can the 
negotiating parties make a joint improvement i e every point in o 
is a pareto-efficient outcome in other words under global strict 
opposition the outcome space o can be flattened out into a single 
line such that for each pair of outcomes x y ∈ o u x u y 
iff u x u y i e at every point in o the gradient of the two 
utility functions point to two different ends of the line 
intuitively global strict opposition implies that there is no way to 
obtain joint improvements for both agents as a consequence the 
negotiation degenerates to a distributive negotiation i e the 
negotiating parties should try to claim as much shares from the 
negotiation issues as possible while the mediator should aim for the 
fairness of the division on the other hand global nonstrict opposition 
allows room for joint improvements and all parties might be better 
off trying to realise the potential gains by reaching pareto-efficient 
agreements weak and strong oppositions indicate different levels 
of opposition the weaker the opposition the more potential gains 
can be realised making cooperation the better strategy to employ 
during negotiation on the other hand stronger opposition 
suggests that the negotiating parties tend to behave strategically 
leading to misrepresentation of their respective objectives and utility 
functions and making joint gains more difficult to realise 
we have been temporarily making the assumption that the 
outcome space o is the subset of rm 
 in many real-world 
negotiations this assumption would be too restrictive we will continue 
our exposition by lifting this restriction and allowing discrete 
attributes however as most negotiations involve only discrete 
issues with a bounded number of options we will assume that each 
attribute takes values either from a finite set or from the set of real 
numbers r in the rest of the paper we will refer to attributes whose 
values are from finite sets as simple attributes and attributes whose 
values are from r as continuous attributes the notions of local 
oppositions i e strict nonstrict weak and strong are not 
applicable to outcome spaces that contain simple attributes and nor are the 
notions of global weak and strong oppositions however the 
notions of global strict and nonstrict oppositions can be generalised 
for outcome spaces that contain simple attributes 
definition given an outcome space o the parties are in 
global strict opposition iff ∀x y ∈ o u x u y iff u x 
u y 
the parties are in global nonstrict opposition if they are not in 
global strict opposition 
 optimisation on simple attributes 
in order to extract the optimal values for a subset of attributes 
in the first step of this optimisation process the mediator requests 
the negotiators to submit their respective utility functions over the 
set of simple attributes let simp ⊆ att denote the set of all 
simple attributes from att note that due to assumption agent i s 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
utility function can be characterised as follows 
ui vsimp vsimp wi 
 ui vsimp wi 
 ui vsimp 
where simp att \ simp and ui and ui are the utility 
components of ui over the sets of attributes simp and simp respectively 
and wi 
 wi 
 and wi 
 wi 
 
as attributes are independent of each other regarding the agents 
utility functions the optimisation problem over the attributes from 
simp can be carried out by fixing ui vsimp to a constant c 
and then search for the optimal values within the set of attributes 
simp now how does the mediator determine the optimal values 
for the attributes in simp several well-known optimisation 
strategies could be applicable here 
 the utilitarian solution the sum of the agents utilities are 
maximised thus the optimal values are the solution of the 
following optimisation problem 
arg max 
v∈v alsimp 
x 
i∈n 
ui v 
 the nash solution the product of the agents utilities are 
maximised thus the optimal values are the solution of the 
following optimisation problem 
arg max 
v∈v alsimp 
y 
i∈n 
ui v 
 the egalitarian solution aka the maximin solution the 
utility of the agent with minimum utility is maximised thus 
the optimal values are the solution of the following 
optimisation problem 
arg max 
v∈v alsimp 
min 
i∈n 
ui v 
the question now is of course whether a negotiator has the 
incentive to misrepresent his utility function first of all recall that the 
agents utility functions are bounded i e ∀o ∈ o ≤ ui o ≤ 
thus the agents have no incentive to overstate their utility 
regarding an outcome o if o is the most preferred outcome to an agent 
i then he already assigns the maximal utility to o on the other 
hand if o is not the most preferred outcome to i then by 
overstating the utility he assigns to o the agent i runs the risk of having 
to settle on an agreement which would give him less payoffs than 
he is supposed to receive however agents do have an incentive 
to understate their utility if the final settlement will be based on the 
above solutions alone essentially the mechanism to avoid an agent 
to understate his utility regarding particular outcomes is to 
guarantee a certain measure of fairness for the final settlement that is 
the agents lose the incentive to be dishonest to obtain gains from 
taking advantage of the known solutions to determine the 
settlement outcome for they would be offset by the fairness maintenance 
mechanism firsts we state an easy lemma 
lemma when simp contains one single attributes the agents 
have the incentive to understate their utility functions regarding 
outcomes that are not attractive to them 
by way of illustration consider the set simp containing only one 
attribute that could take values from the finite set a b c d 
assume that negotiator assigns utilities of and 
to a b c and d respectively assume also that negotiator 
assigns utilities of and to a b c and d 
respectively if agent misrepresents his utility function to the mediator 
by reporting utility for all values a b and c and utility for 
value d then the agent who plays honestly in his report to the 
mediator will obtain the worst outcome d given any of the above 
solutions note that agent doesn t need to know agent s utility 
function nor does he need to know the strategy employed by agent 
 as long as he knows that the mediator is going to employ one of 
the above three solutions then the above misrepresentation is the 
dominant strategy for this game 
however when the set simp contains more than one attribute 
and none of the attributes strongly dominate the other attributes 
then the above problem disminishes by itself thanks to the 
integrative solution we of course have to define clearly what it means 
for an attribute to strongly dominate other attributes intuitively if 
most of an agent s utility concentrates on one of the attributes then 
this attribute strongly dominates other attributes we again appeal 
to the assumption on additivity of utility functions to achieve a 
measure of fairness within this negotiation setting due to 
assumption we can characterise agent i s utility component over the set 
of attributes simp by the following equation 
ui vsimp 
x 
j∈simp 
wi 
j ui j vj 
where 
p 
j∈simp wj 
then an attribute ∈ simp strongly dominates the rest of the 
attributes in simp for agent i iff wi 
 
p 
j∈ simp− wi 
j attribute 
is said to be strongly dominant for agent i wrt the set of simple 
attributes simp 
the following theorem shows that if the set of attributes simp 
does not contain a strongly dominant attribute then the negotiators 
have no incentive to be dishonest 
theorem given a negotiation framework if for every agent 
the set of simple attributes doesn t contain a strongly dominant 
attribute then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the 
negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes 
so far we have been concentrating on the efficiency issue while 
leaving the fairness issue aside a fair framework does not only 
support a more satisfactory distribution of utility among the agents 
but also often a good measure to prevent misrepresentation of 
private information by the agents of the three solutions presented 
above the utilitarian solution does not support fairness on the 
other hand nash proves that the nash solution satisfies the 
above four axioms for the cooperative bargaining games and is 
considered a fair solution the egalitarian solution is another 
mechanism to achieve fairness by essentially helping the worst off the 
problem with these solutions as discussed earlier is that they are 
vulnerable to strategic behaviours when one of the attributes strongly 
dominates the rest of attributes 
however there is yet another solution that aims to guarantee 
fairness the minimax solution that is the utility of the agent with 
maximum utility is minimised it s obvious that the minimax 
solution produces inefficient outcomes however to get around this 
problem given that the pareto-optimal set can be tractably 
computed we can apply this solution over the pareto-optimal set only 
let poset ⊆ v alsimp be the pareto-optimal subset of the simple 
outcomes the minimax solution is defined to be the solution of the 
following optimisation problem 
arg min 
v∈p oset 
max 
i∈n 
ui v 
while overall efficiency often suffers under a minimax solution 
i e the sum of all agents utilities are often lower than under other 
solutions it can be shown that the minimax solution is less 
vulnerable to manipulation 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
theorem given a negotiation framework under the 
minimax solution if the negotiators are uncertain about their 
opponents preferences then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for 
the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes 
that is even when there is only one single simple attribute if an 
agent is uncertain whether the other agent s most preferred 
resolution is also his own most preferred resolution then he should opt for 
truth-telling as the optimal strategy 
 optimisation on continuous attributes 
when the attributes take values from infinite sets we assume that 
they are continuous this is similar to the common practice in 
operations research in which linear programming solutions techniques 
are applied to integer programming problems 
we denote the number of continuous attributes by k i e att 
simp ∪ simp and simp k then the outcome space o can be 
represented as follows o 
q 
j∈simp v alj × 
q 
l∈simp v all 
where 
q 
l∈simp v all ⊆ rk 
is the continuous component of o let 
oc 
denote the set 
q 
l∈simp v all we ll refer to oc 
as the feasible 
set and assume that oc 
is closed and convex after carrying out 
the optimisation over the set of simple attributes we are able to 
assign the optimal values to the simple attributes from simp thus 
we reduce the original problem to the problem of searching for 
optimal and fair outcomes within the feasible set oc 
 recall that 
by assumption we can characterise agent i s utility function as 
follows 
ui v 
simp vsimp c wi 
 ui vsimp 
where c is the constant wi 
 ui v 
simp and v 
simp denotes the 
optimal values of the simple attributes in simp hence without loss 
of generality albeit with a blatant abuse of notation we can take 
the agent i s utility function as ui rk 
→ accordingly we 
will also take the set of outcomes under consideration by the agents 
to be the feasible set oc 
 we now state another assumption to be 
used in this section 
assumption the negotiators utility functions can be 
described by continuously differentiable and concave functions ui 
rk 
→ i 
it should be emphasised that we do not assume that agents 
explicitly know their utility functions for the method to be described 
in the following to work we only assume that the agents know the 
relevant information e g at certain point within the feasible set oc 
 
the gradient direction of their own utility functions and some 
section of their respective indifference curves assume that a tentative 
agreement which is a point x ∈ rk 
 is currently on the table the 
process for the agents to jointly improve this agreement in order to 
reach a pareto-optimal agreement can be described as follows the 
mediator asks the negotiators to discretely submit their respective 
gradient directions at x i e ∇u x and ∇u x 
note that the goal of the process to be described here is to search 
for agreements that are more efficient than the tentative agreement 
currently on the table that is we are searching for points x within 
the feasible set oc 
such that moving to x from the current tentative 
agreement x brings more gains to at least one of the agents while 
not hurting any of the agents due to the assumption made above 
i e the feasible set oc 
is bounded the conditions for an alternative 
x ∈ oc 
to be efficient vary depending on the position of x the 
following results are proved in 
let b x denote the equation of the boundary of oc 
 
defining x ∈ oc 
iff b x ≥ an alternative x 
∈ oc 
is efficient iff 
either 
a x 
is in the interior of oc 
and the parties are in local strict 
opposition at x 
 i e 
∇u x 
 −γ∇u x 
 
where γ or 
b x 
is on the boundary of oc 
 and for some α β ≥ 
α∇u x 
 β∇u x 
 ∇b x 
 
we are now interested in answering the following questions 
 i what is the initial tentative agreement x 
 ii how to find the more efficient agreement xh given the 
current tentative agreement xh 
 determining a fair initial tentative agreement 
it should be emphasised that the choice of the initial tentative 
agreement affects the fairness of the final agreement to be reached 
by the presented method for instance if the initial tentative 
agreement x is chosen to be the most preferred alternative to one of 
the agents then it is also a pareto-optimal outcome making it 
impossible to find any joint improvement from x however if x 
will then be chosen to be the final settlement and if x turns out 
to be the worst alternative to the other agent then this outcome is a 
very unfair one thus it s important that the choice of the initial 
tentative agreement be sensibly made 
ehtamo et al present several methods to choose the initial 
tentative agreement called reference point in their paper however 
their goal is to approximate the pareto-optimal set by 
systematically choosing a set of reference points once an approximate 
pareto-optimal set is generated it is left to the negotiators to decide 
which of the generated pareto-optimal outcomes to be chosen as 
the final settlement that is distributive negotiation will then be 
required to settle the issue 
we on the other hand are interested in a fair initial tentative 
agreement which is not necessarily efficient improving a given 
tentative agreement to yield a pareto-optimal agreement is 
considered in the next section for each attribute j ∈ simp an agent i will 
be asked to discretely submit three values from the set v alj the 
most preferred value denoted by pvi j the least preferred value 
denoted by wvi j and a value that gives i an approximately 
average payoff denoted by avi j note that this is possible 
because the set v alj is bounded if pv j and pv j are sufficiently 
close i e pv j − pv j δ for some pre-defined δ 
then pv j and pv j are chosen to be the two core values 
denoted by cv and cv otherwise between the two values pv j 
and av j we eliminate the one that is closer to wv j the 
remaining value is denoted by cv similarly we obtain cv from the 
two values pv j and av j if cv cv then cv is selected as 
the initial value for the attribute j as part of the initial tentative 
agreement otherwise without loss of generality we assume that 
cv cv the mediator selects randomly p values mv mvp 
from the open interval cv cv where p ≥ the mediator then 
asks the agents to submit their valuations over the set of values 
 cv cv mv mvp the value whose the two valuations of 
two agents are closest is selected as the initial value for the attribute 
j as part of the initial tentative agreement 
the above procedure guarantees that the agents do not gain by 
behaving strategically by performing the above procedure on 
every attribute j ∈ simp we are able to identify the initial tentative 
agreement x such that x ∈ oc 
 the next step is to compute 
a new tentative agreement from an existing tentative agreement so 
that the new one would be more efficient than the existing one 
the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
 computing new tentative agreement 
our procedure is a combination of the method of jointly 
improving direction introduced by ehtamo et al and a method we 
propose in the coming section basically the idea is to see how strong 
the opposition the parties are in if the two parties are in local 
weak opposition at the current tentative agreement xh i e their 
improving directions at xh are close to each other then the 
compromise direction proposed by ehtamo et al is likely to point to 
a better agreement for both agents however if the two parties are 
in local strong opposition at the current point xh then it s unclear 
whether the compromise direction would really not hurt one of the 
agents whilst bringing some benefit to the other 
we will first review the method proposed by ehtamo et al 
to compute the compromise direction for a group of negotiators at 
a given point x ∈ oc 
 ehtamo et al define a a function t x 
that describes the mediator s choice for a compromise direction at 
x for the case of two-party negotiations the following bisecting 
function denoted by t bs 
 can be defined over the interior set of oc 
 
note that the closed set oc 
contains two disjoint subsets oc 
 
oc 
 ∪oc 
b where oc 
 denotes the set of interior points of oc 
and oc 
b 
denotes the boundary of oc 
 the bisecting compromise is defined 
by a function t bs 
 oc 
 → r 
 
t bs

∇u x 
 
∇u x

 x ∈ oc 
 
given the current tentative agreement xh h ≥ the mediator 
has to choose a point xh along d t xh so that all parties 
gain ehtamo et al then define a mechanism to generate a sequence 
of points and prove that when the generated sequence is bounded 
and when all generated points from the sequence belong to the 
interior set oc 
 then the sequence converges to a weakly 
paretooptimal agreement pp - 
as the above mechanism does not work at the boundary points 
of oc 
 we will introduce a procedure that works everywhere in an 
alternative space oc 
 let x ∈ oc 
and let θ x denote the angle 
between the gradients ∇u x and ∇u x at x that is 
θ x arccos 
∇u x ∇u x 
∇u x ∇u x 
 
from definition it is obvious that the two parties are in local 
strict opposition at x iff θ x π and they are in local strong 
opposition iff π ≥ θ x π and they are in local weak 
opposition iff π ≥ θ x ≥ note also that the two vectors ∇u x 
and ∇u x define a hyperplane denoted by h∇ x in the 
kdimensional space rk 
 furthermore there are two indifference 
curves of agents and going through point x denoted by ic x 
and ic x respectively let ht x and ht x denote the 
tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves ic x and ic x 
respectively at point x the planes ht x and ht x intersect 
h∇ x in the lines is x and is x respectively note that 
given a line l x going through the point x there are two unit 
vectors from x along l x pointing to two opposite directions 
denoted by l 
 x and l− 
 x 
we can now informally explain our solution to the problem of 
searching for joint gains when it isn t possible to obtain a 
compromise direction for joint improvements at a point x ∈ oc 
either 
because the compromise vector points to the space outside of the 
feasible set oc 
or because the two parties are in local strong 
opposition at x we will consider to move along the indifference curve of 
one party while trying to improve the utility of the other party as 
 
let s be the set of alternatives x 
is weakly pareto optimal if 
there is no x ∈ s such that ui x ui x 
 for all agents i 
the mediator does not know the indifference curves of the parties 
he has to use the tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves of 
the parties at point x note that the tangent hyperplane to a curve 
is a useful approximation of the curve in the immediate vicinity of 
the point of tangency x 
we are now describing an iteration step to reach the next tentative 
agreement xh from the current tentative agreement xh ∈ oc 
 a 
vector v whose tail is xh is said to be bounded in oc 
if ∃λ 
such that xh λv ∈ oc 
 to start the mediator asks the negotiators 
for their gradients ∇u xh and ∇u xh respectively at xh 
 if xh is a pareto-optimal outcome according to equation or 
equation then the process is terminated 
 if ≥ ∇u xh ∇u xh and the vector t bs 
 xh is 
bounded in oc 
then the mediator chooses the compromise 
improving direction d t bs 
 xh and apply the method 
described by ehtamo et al to generate the next tentative 
agreement xh 
 otherwise among the four vectors isσ 
i xh i and 
σ − the mediator chooses the vector that i is bounded 
in oc 
 and ii is closest to the gradient of the other agent 
∇uj xh j i denote this vector by t g xh that is 
we will be searching for a point on the indifference curve of 
agent i ici xh while trying to improve the utility of agent 
j note that when xh is an interior point of oc 
then the 
situation is symmetric for the two agents and and the mediator 
has the choice of either finding a point on ic xh to 
improve the utility of agent or finding a point on ic xh to 
improve the utility of agent to decide on which choice to 
make the mediator has to compute the distribution of gains 
throughout the whole process to avoid giving more gains to 
one agent than to the other now the point xh to be 
generated lies somewhere on the intersection of ici xh and the 
hyperplane defined by ∇ui xh and t g xh this 
intersection is approximated by t g xh thus the sought 
after point xh can be generated by first finding a point yh 
along the direction of t g xh and then move from yh to the 
same direction of ∇ui xh until we intersect with ici xh 
mathematically let ζ and ξ denote the vectors t g xh and 
∇ui xh respectively xh is the solution to the following 
optimisation problem 
max 
λ λ ∈l 
uj xh λ ζ λ ξ 
s t xh λ ζ λ ξ ∈ oc 
 and ui xh λ ζ λ ξ ui xh 
where l is a suitable interval of positive real numbers e g 
l λ λ or l λ a λ ≤ b ≤ a b 
given an initial tentative agreement x the method described 
above allows a sequence of tentative agreements x x to be 
iteratively generated the iteration stops whenever a weakly pareto 
optimal agreement is reached 
theorem if the sequence of agreements generated by the 
above method is bounded then the method converges to a point 
x 
∈ oc 
that is weakly pareto optimal 
 conclusion and future work 
in this paper we have established a framework for negotiation 
that is based on mcdm theory for representing the agents 
objectives and utilities the focus of the paper is on integrative 
negotiation in which agents aim to maximise joint gains or create value 
 the sixth intl joint conf on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems aamas 
we have introduced a mediator into the negotiation in order to 
allow negotiators to disclose information about their utilities 
without providing this information to their opponents furthermore the 
mediator also works toward the goal of achieving fairness of the 
negotiation outcome 
that is the approach that we describe aims for both efficiency in 
the sense that it produces pareto optimal outcomes i e no aspect 
can be improved for one of the parties without worsening the 
outcome for another party and also for fairness which chooses 
optimal solutions which distribute gains amongst the agents in some 
appropriate manner we have developed a two step process for 
addressing the np-hard problem of finding a solution for a set of 
integrative attributes which is within the pareto-optimal set for those 
attributes for simple attributes i e those which have a finite set 
of values we use known optimisation techniques to find a 
paretooptimal solution in order to discourage agents from 
misrepresenting their utilities to gain an advantage we look for solutions that 
are least vulnerable to manipulation we have shown that as long 
as one of the simple attributes does not strongly dominate the 
others then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators 
during the stage of optimising simple attributes for non-simple 
attributes we propose a mechanism that provides stepwise 
improvements to move the proposed solution in the direction of a 
paretooptimal solution 
the approach presented in this paper is similar to the ideas 
behind negotiation analysis ehtamo et al presents an 
approach to searching for joint gains in multi-party negotiations the 
relation of their approach to our approach is discussed in the 
preceding section lai et al provide an alternative approach to 
integrative negotiation while their approach was clearly described 
for the case of two-issue negotiations the generalisation to 
negotiations with more than two issues is not entirely clear 
zhang et at discuss the use of integrative negotiation in 
agent organisations they assume that agents are honest their 
main result is an experiment showing that in some situations agents 
cooperativeness may not bring the most benefits to the organisation 
as a whole while giving no explanation jonker et al consider 
an approach to multi-attribute negotiation without the use of a 
mediator thus their approach can be considered a complement of 
ours their experimental results show that agents can reach 
paretooptimal outcomes using their approach 
the details of the approach have currently been shown only for 
bilateral negotiation and while we believe they are generalisable to 
multiple negotiators this work remains to be done there is also 
future work to be done in more fully characterising the outcomes 
of the determination of values for the non-simple attributes in 
order to provide a complete framework we are also working on the 
distributive phase using the mediator
