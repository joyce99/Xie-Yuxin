abstract 
we propose a novel method of analysing data gathered from 
trec or similar information retrieval evaluation 
experiments we define two normalized versions of average 
precision that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph 
of trec systems and topics we analyze the meaning of 
well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators from 
social network analysis on the systems-topics graph we 
apply this method to an analysis of trec data among 
the results we find that authority measures systems 
performance that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are 
better than others at distinguishing more or less effective 
systems that with current measures a system that wants to 
be effective in trec needs to be effective on easy topics 
and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no 
longer the case

 introduction 
evaluation is a primary concern in the information 
retrieval ir field trec text retrieval conference 
 is an annual benchmarking exercise that has become a 
de facto standard in ir evaluation before the actual 
conference trec provides to participants a collection of 
documents and a set of topics representations of information 
needs participants use their systems to retrieve and 
submit to trec a list of documents for each topic after the 
lists have been submitted and pooled the trec organizers 
employ human assessors to provide relevance judgements on 
the pooled set this defines a set of relevant documents for 
each topic system effectiveness is then measured by well 
established metrics mean average precision being the most 
used other conferences such as ntcir inex clef 
provide comparable data 
network analysis is a discipline that studies features and 
properties of usually large networks or graphs of 
particular importance is social network analysis that studies 
networks made up by links among humans friendship 
acquaintance co-authorship bibliographic citation etc 
network analysis and ir fruitfully meet in web search 
engine implementation as is already described in textbooks 
 current search engines use link analysis techniques to 
help rank the retrieved documents some indicators and 
the corresponding algorithms that compute them have been 
found useful in this respect and are nowadays well known 
inlinks the number of links to a web page pagerank 
and hits hyperlink-induced topic search several 
extensions to these algorithms have been and are being 
proposed these indicators and algorithms might be quite 
general in nature and can be used for applications which are 
very different from search result ranking one example is 
using hits for stemming as described by agosti et al 
in this paper we propose and demonstrate a method 
for constructing a network specifically a weighted complete 
bidirectional directed bipartite graph on a set of trec 
topics and participating systems links represent effectiveness 
measurements on system-topic pairs we then apply 
analysis methods originally developed for search applications to 
the resulting network this reveals phenomena previously 
hidden in trec data in passing we also provide a small 
generalization to kleinberg s hits algorithm as well as to 
inlinks and pagerank 
the paper is organized as follows sect gives some 
motivations for the work sect presents the basic ideas of 
normalizing average precision and of constructing a 
systemstopics graph whose properties are analyzed in sect sect 
presents some experiments on trec data sect 
discusses some issues and sect closes the paper 
 motivations 
we are interested in the following hypotheses 
 some systems are more effective than others

table ap map and aap 
 some topics are easier than others 
 some systems are better than others at distinguishing 
easy and difficult topics 
 some topics are better than others at distinguishing 
more or less effective systems 
the first of these hypotheses needs no further justification 
- every reported significant difference between any two 
systems supports it there is now also quite a lot of evidence 
for the second centered on the trec robust track 
our primary interest is in the third and fourth the third 
might be regarded as being of purely academic interest 
however the fourth has the potential for being of major 
practical importance in evaluation studies if we could identify 
a relatively small number of topics which were really good 
at distinguishing effective and ineffective systems we could 
save considerable effort in evaluating systems 
one possible direction from this point would be to attempt 
direct identification of such small sets of topics however in 
the present paper we seek instead to explore the 
relationships suggested by the hypotheses between what different 
topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell 
us about topics we seek methods of building and analysing 
a matrix of system-topic normalised performances with a 
view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or 
refuting the third and fourth hypotheses it turns out that 
the obvious symmetry implied by the above formulation of 
the hypotheses is a property worth investigating and the 
investigation does indeed give us valuable insights 
 the idea 
 st step average precision table 
from trec results one can produce an average 
precision ap table see tab a each ap si tj value 
measures the ap of system si on topic tj 
besides ap values the table shows mean average 
precision map values i e the mean of the ap values for a 
single system over all topics and what we call average 
average precision aap values i e the average of the ap 
values for a single topic over all systems

ap si tj 
maps are indicators of systems performance higher map 
means good system aap are indicators of the performance 
on a topic higher aap means easy topic - a topic on which 
all or most systems have good performance 
 critique of pure ap 
map is a standard well known and widely used ir 
effectiveness measure single ap values are used too e g 
in ap histograms topic difficulty is often discussed e g 
in trec robust track although aap values are not 
used and to the best of our knowledge have never been 
proposed the median not the average of ap on a topic 
is used to produce trec ap histograms however 
the ap values in tab present two limitations which are 
symmetric in some respect 
 problem they are not reliable to compare the 
effectiveness of a system on different topics relative 
to the other systems if for example ap s t 
ap s t can we infer that s is a good system i e 
has a good performance on t and a bad system on 
t the answer is no t might be an easy topic with 
high aap and t a difficult one low aap see an 
example in tab b s is outperformed on average 
by the other systems on t and it outperforms the 
other systems on t 
 problem conversely if for example ap s t 
ap s t can we infer that t is considered easier 
by s than by s no we cannot s might be a good 
system with high map and s a bad one low map 
see an example in tab b 
these two problems are a sort of breakdown of the well 
known high influence of topics on ir evaluation again our 
formulation makes explicit the topics systems symmetry 
 nd step normalizations 
to avoid these two problems we can normalize the ap 
table in two ways the first normalization removes the 
influence of the single topic ease on system performance each 
ap si tj value in the table depends on both system 
goodness and topic ease the value will increase if a system is 
good and or the topic is easy by subtracting from each 
ap si tj the aap tj value we obtain normalized ap 
values apa si tj normalized ap according to aap 
apa si tj ap si tj − aap tj 
that depend on system performance only the value will 
increase only if system performance is good see tab a 
the second normalization removes the influence of the 
single system effectiveness on topic ease by subtracting from 
each ap si tj the map si value we obtain normalized 
ap values apm si tj normalized ap according to map 
apm si tj ap si tj − map si 
that depend on topic ease only the value will increase only 
if the topic is easy i e all systems perform well on that 
topic see tab b 
in other words apa avoids problem apa s t values 
measure the performance of system s on topic t normalized

table normalizations apa and map normalized 
ap apa and map map a normalized ap apm 
and aap aap b a numeric example c and d 
according to the ease of the topic easy topics will not have 
higher apa values now if for example apa s t 
apa s t we can infer that s is a good system on t and 
a bad system on t see tab c vice versa apm avoids 
problem apm s t values measure the ease of topic t 
according to system s normalized according to goodness 
of the system good systems will not lead to higher apm 
values if for example apm s t apm s t we 
can infer that t is considered easier by s than by s see 
tab d 
on the basis of tables a and b we can also define two 
new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease i e a 
normalized map map obtained by averaging the apa 
values on one row in tab a and a normalized aap aap 
obtained by averaging the apm values on one column in 
tab b

 the proof is analogous and relies on eqs and 
the two tables a and b are interesting per se and can 
be analyzed in several different ways in the following we 
propose an analysis based on network analysis techniques 
mainly kleinberg s hits algorithm there is a little further 
discussion of these normalizations in sect 
 rd step systems-topics graph 
the two tables a and b can be merged into a single one 
with the procedure shown in fig the obtained matrix 
can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a complete 
weighted bipartite graph that we call systems-topics graph 
arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows 
 weight on arc s → t how much the system s thinks 
that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has 
no knowledge of the other systems or in other words 
how easy we might think the topic is knowing only 
the results for this one system this corresponds to 
apm values i e to normalized topic ease fig a 
 weight on arc s ← t how much the topic t thinks 
that the system s is good - assuming that a topic has 
no knowledge of the other topics or in other words 
how good we might think the system is knowing only 
the results for this one topic this corresponds to 
apa normalized system effectiveness fig b 
figs c and d show the systems-topics complete weighted 
bipartite graph on a toy example with systems and 
topics the graph is split in two parts to have an understandable 
graphical representation arcs in fig c are labeled with 
apm values arcs in fig d are labeled with apa values 
 analysis of the graph 
 weighted inlinks outlinks pagerank 
the sum of weighted outlinks i e the sum of the weights 
on the outgoing arcs from each node is always zero 
 the outlinks on each node corresponding to a system

values on one row of the matrix in tab b 
 the outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic

values on one row of the transpose of the matrix in

the average 
of weighted inlinks is 
 map for each node corresponding to a system s this 
corresponds to the average of all the corresponding 
apa values on one column of the apa 
t 
part of the 
adjacency matrix see fig 
 aap for each node corresponding to a topic t this 
corresponds to the average of all the corresponding 
apm values on one column of the apm part of the 
adjacency matrix see fig 
therefore weighted inlinks measure either system 
effectiveness or topic ease weighted outlinks are not meaningful we 
could also apply the pagerank algorithm to the network 
the meaning of the pagerank of a node is not quite so 
obvious as inlinks and outlinks but it also seems a sensible 
measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease if a 
system is effective it will have several incoming links with high 
 
usually the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to 
each node is used in place of the average since the graph is 
complete it makes no difference 
weights apa if a topic is easy it will have high weights 
 apm on the incoming links too we will see experimental 
confirmation in the following 
 hubs and authorities 
let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators 
kleinberg s hits algorithm defines for a directed graph two 
indicators hubness and authority we reiterate here some of 
the basic details of the hits algorithm in order to 
emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the 
interpretation of the hits concepts in this context usually hubness 
and authority are defined as h x 
p 
x→y a y and a x 
p 
y→x h y and described intuitively as a good hub links 
many good authorities a good authority is linked from many 
good hubs as it is well known an equivalent formulation 
in linear algebra terms is see also fig 
h aa and a at 
h 
 where h is the hubness vector with the hub values for all 
the nodes a is the authority vector a is the adjacency 
matrix of the graph and at 
its transpose usually a 
contains s and s only corresponding to presence and absence 
of unweighted directed arcs but eq can be immediately 
generalized to in fact it is already valid for a containing 
any real value i e to weighted graphs 
therefore we can have a generalized version or rather 
a generalized interpretation since the formulation is still 
the original one of hubness and authority for all nodes in 
a graph an intuitive formulation of this generalized hits 
is still available although slightly more complex a good 
hub links by means of arcs having high weights many good 
authorities a good authority is linked by means of arcs 
having high weights from many good hubs since arc weights 
can be in general negative hub and authority values can be 
negative and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority 
the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that 
a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with 
highly negative weights a good authority is linked by good 
unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights 
and also a good unhub links positively good 
unauthorities and negatively good authorities a good unauthority 
is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from 
good hubs 
let us now apply generalized hits to our systems-topics 
graph we compute a s h s a t and h t intuitively 
we expect that a s is somehow similar to inlinks so it 
should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic 
ease similarly hubness should be more similar to outlinks 
thus less meaningful although the interplay between hub 
and authority might lead to the discovery of something 
different let us start by remarking that authority of topics 
and hubness of systems depend only on each other similarly 
hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on 
each other see figs c d and 
thus the two graphs in figs c and d can be analyzed 
independently in fact the entire hits analysis could be 
done in one direction only with just apm s t values or 
alternatively with just apa s t as discussed below 
probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the 
authority of systems so the latter makes sense however in 
this paper we pursue both analyses together because the 
symmetry itself is interesting 
considering fig c we can state that 
 authority a t of a topic node t increases when 
- if h si apm si t increases 
 or if apm si t h si increases 
- if h si apm si t decreases 
 or if apm si t h si decreases 
 hubness h s of a system node s increases when 
- if a tj apm s tj increases 
 or if apm s tj a tj increases 
- if a tj apm s tj decreases 
 or if apm s tj a tj decreases 
we can summarize this as a t is high if apm s t is high 
for those systems with high h s h s is high if apm s t 
is high for those topics with high a t intuitively authority 
a t of a topic measures topic ease hubness h s of a system 
measures system s capability to recognize easy topics a 
system with high unhubness negative hubness would tend 
to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy 
the situation for fig d i e for a s and h t is 
analogous authority a s of a system node s measures system 
effectiveness it increases with the weight on the arc i e 
apa s tj and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj 
hubness h t of a topic node t measures topic capability to 
recognize effective systems if h t it increases further 
if apa s tj increases if h t it increases if apa s tj 
decreases 
intuitively we can state that a system has a higher 
authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness 
and a topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those 
systems which are more effective in general conversely for 
system hubness and topic authority a topic has a higher 
authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness and 
a system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for 
those topics which are easier in general 
therefore for each system we have two indicators 
authority a s measuring system effectiveness and hubness 
 h s measuring system capability to estimate topic ease 
and for each topic we have two indicators authority a t 
measuring topic ease and hubness h t measuring topic 
capability to estimate systems effectiveness we can define 
them formally as 
a s 
x 
t 
h t · apa s t h t 
x 
s 
a s · apa s t 
a t 
x 
s 
h s · apm s t h s 
x 
t 
a t · apm s t 
we observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular 
interest for evaluation studies it may be that we can 
evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively 
few high-hubness topics 
 experiments 
we now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful 
and useful in practice and how they correlate with standard 
measures used in trec we have built the systems-topics 
graph for trec data featuring 
systems - actually 
 
actually trec data features systems due to 
some bug in our scripts we did not include one system

authority and respectively map or aap outlinks 
values are not shown since they are always zero as seen in 
sect as expected inlinks and pagerank have a perfect 
correlation with map and aap authority has a very high 
correlation too with map and aap hub assumes slightly 
lower values 
let us analyze the correlations more in detail the 
correlations chart in figs a and b demonstrate the high 
correlation between authority and map or aap hubness 
presents interesting phenomena both fig c correlation 
with map and fig d correlation with aap show that 
correlation is not exact but neither is it random this given 
the meaning of hubness capability in estimating topic ease 
and system effectiveness means two things i more 
effective systems are better at estimating topic ease and ii 
easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness 
whereas the first statement is fine there is nothing against 
it the second is a bit worrying it means that system 
effectiveness in trec is affected more by easy topics than by 
difficult topics which is rather undesirable for quite obvious 
reasons a system capable of performing well on a difficult 
topic i e on a topic on which the other systems perform 
badly would be an important result for ir effectiveness

figure correlations map x axis and authority y axis of systems a aap and authority of topics 
 b map and hub of systems c and aap and hub of topics d 
versely a system capable of performing well on easy topics 
is just a confirmation of the state of the art indeed the 
correlation between hubness and aap statement i above is 
higher than the correlation between hubness and map 
 corresponding to statement ii vs however this 
phenomenon is quite strong this is also confirmed by the 
work being done on the trec robust track 
in this respect it is interesting to see what happens if we 
use a different measure from map and aap the gmap 
 geometric map metric is defined as the geometric mean of 
ap values or equivalently as the arithmetic mean of the 
logarithms of ap values gmap has the property of giving 
more weight to the low end of the ap scale i e to low ap 
values and this seems reasonable since intuitively a 
performance increase in map values from to should 
be more important than an increase from to to 
use gmap in place of map and aap we only need to take 
the logarithms of initial ap values i e those in tab a 
 zero values are modified into ε we then repeat 
the same normalization process with gmap and gaap 
- geometric aap - replacing map and aap whereas 
authority values still perfectly correlate with gmap 
and gaap the correlation with hubness largely 
disappears values are − and − - slightly negative but 
not enough to concern us 
this is yet another confirmation that trec effectiveness 
as measured by map depends mainly on easy topics gmap 
appears to be a more balanced measure note that 
perhaps surprisingly gmap is indeed fairly well balanced not 
biased in the opposite direction - that is it does not 
overemphasize the difficult topics 
in sect below we discuss another transformation 
replacing the log function used in gmap with logit this has 
a similar effect the correlation of mean logitap and average 
logitap with hubness are now small positive numbers 
and respectively still comfortably away from the high 
correlations with regular map and aap i e not presenting 
the problematic phenomenon ii above over-dependency on 
easy topics 
we also observe that hub values are positive whereas 
authority assumes as predicted both positive and negative 
values an intuitive justification is that negative hubness 
would indicate a node which disagrees with the other nodes 
e g a system which does better on difficult topics or a 
topic on which bad systems do better such systems and 
topics would be quite strange and probably do not appear 
in trec finally although one might think that topics with 
several relevant documents are more important and difficult 
this is not the case there is no correlation between hub or 
any other indicator and the number of documents relevant 
to a topic 
 discussion 
 related work 
there has been considerable interest in recent years in 
questions of statistical significance of effectiveness 
comparisons between systems e g and related questions of 
how many topics might be needed to establish differences 
 e g we regard some results of the present study as 
in some way complementary to this work in that we make a 
step towards answering the question which topics are best 
for establishing differences 
the results on evaluation without relevance judgements 
such as show that to some extent good systems agree 
on which are the good documents we have not addressed 
the question of individual documents in the present analysis 
but this effect is certainly analogous to our results 
 are normalizations necessary 
at this point it is also worthwhile to analyze what would 
happen without the map- and aap-normalizations defined 
in sect indeed the process of graph construction 
 sect is still valid both the apm and apa matrices 
are replaced by the ap one and then everything goes on as 
above therefore one might think that the normalizations 
are unuseful in this setting 
this is not the case from the theoretical point of view 
the ap-only graph does not present the interesting 
properties above discussed since the ap-only graph is 
symmetrical the weight on each incoming link is equal to the weight 
on the corresponding outgoing link inlinks and outlinks 
assume the same values there is symmetry also in 
computing hub and authority that assume the same value for each 
node since the weights on the incoming and outgoing arcs 
are the same this could be stated in more precise and 
formal terms but one might still wonder if on the overall graph 
there are some sort of counterbalancing effects it is 
therefore easier to look at experimental data which confirm that 
the normalizations are needed the correlations between ap 
inlinks outlinks hub and or authority are all very close 
to one none of them is below 
 are these normalizations sufficient 
it might be argued that in the case of apa for example 
the amount we have subtracted from each ap value is 
topicdependent therefore the range of the resulting apa value 
is also topic-dependent e g the maximum is − aap tj 
and the minimum is − aap tj this suggests that the 
cross-topic comparisons of these values suggested in sect 
may not be reliable a similar issue arises for apm and 
comparisons across systems 
one possible way to overcome this would be to use an 
unconstrained measure whose range is the full real line note 
that in applying the method to gmap by using log ap we 
avoid the problem with the lower limit but retain it for the 
upper limit one way to achieve an unconstrainted range 
would be to use the logit function rather than the log 
we have also run this variant as already reported in 
sect above and it appears to provide very similar 
results to the gmap results already given this is not 
surprising since in practice the two functions are very similar 
over most of the operative range the normalizations thus 
seem reliable 
 on aat 
and at 
a 
it is well known that h and a vectors are the principal 
left eigenvectors of aat 
and at 
a respectively this can 
be easily derived from eqs and that in the case of 
citation graphs aat 
and at 
a represent respectively 
bibliographic coupling and co-citations what is the meaning 
if any of aat 
and at 
a in our systems-topics graph it 
is easy to derive that

systems effectiveness low values single out systems that 
are somehow controversial and that need several topics 
to have a correct effectiveness assessment 
 d if i j ∈ t then at 
a i j 
p 
k∈s apm k i ·apm k j 
measures how much agreement on the ease of the two 
topics i and j there is over all systems high values mean 
that many systems quite agree on the two topics ease 
therefore these matrices are meaningful and somehow 
interesting for instance the submatrix b corresponds to 
a weighted undirected complete graph whose nodes are the 
topics and whose arc weights are a measure of how much 
two topics agree on systems effectiveness two topics that 
are very close on this graph give the same information and 
therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in 
trec results it would be interesting to cluster the topics 
on this graph furthermore the matrix graph a could be 
useful in trec pool formation systems that do not agree 
on topic ease would probably find different relevant 
documents and should therefore be complementary in pool 
formation note that no notion of single documents is involved 
in the above analysis 
 insights 
as indicated the primary contribution of this paper has 
been a method of analysis however in the course of 
applying this method to one set of trec results we have 
achieved some insights relating to the hypotheses formulated 
in sect 
 we confirm hypothesis above that some topics are 
easier than others 
 differences in the hubness of systems reveal that some 
systems are better than others at distinguishing easy 
and difficult topics thus we have some confirmation of 
hypothesis 
 there are some relatively idiosyncratic systems which 
do badly on some topics generally considered easy but 
well on some hard topics however on the whole the 
more effective systems are better at distinguishing easy 
and difficult topics this is to be expected a really 
bad system will do badly on everything while even a 
good system may have difficulty with some topics 
 differences in the hubness of topics reveal that some 
topics are better than others at distinguising more or 
less effective systems thus we have some confirmation 
of hypothesis 
 if we use map as the measure of effectiveness it is 
also true that the easiest topics are better at 
distinguishing more or less effective systems as argued in 
sect this is an undesirable property gmap is more 
balanced 
clearly these ideas need to be tested on other data sets 
however they reveal that the method of analysis proposed 
in this paper can provide valuable information 
 selecting topics 
the confirmation of hypothesis leads as indicated to 
the idea that we could do reliable system evaluation on a 
much smaller set of topics provided we could select such an 
appropriate set this selection may not be straightforward 
however it is possible that simply selecting the high 
hubness topics will achieve this end however it is also possible 
that there are significant interactions between topics which 
would render such a simple rule ineffective this 
investigation would therefore require serious experimentation for 
this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to 
the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation 
this is left for future work 
 conclusions and future 
developments 
the contribution of this paper is threefold 
 we propose a novel way of normalizing ap values 
 we propose a novel method to analyse trec data 
 the method applied on trec data does indeed reveal 
some hidden properties 
more particularly we propose average average precision 
 aap a measure of topic ease and a novel way of 
normalizing the average precision measure in trec on the basis 
of both map mean average precision and aap the 
normalized measures apm and apa are used to build a 
bipartite weighted systems-topics graph that is then 
analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known 
in the social network analysis field but somewhat 
generalised we note that no such approach to trec data 
analysis has been proposed so far the analysis shows that 
with current measures a system that wants to be effective 
in trec needs to be effective on easy topics also it is 
suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to 
relying on a lower number of topics 
our method of analysis as described in this paper can 
be applied only a posteriori i e once we have all the 
topics and all the systems available adding removing a new 
system topic would mean re-computing hubness and 
authority indicators moreover we are not explicitly proposing 
a change to current trec methodology although this could 
be a by-product of these - and further - analyses 
this is an initial work and further analyses could be 
performed for instance other effectiveness metrics could be 
used in place of ap other centrality indicators widely 
used in social network analysis could be computed although 
probably with similar results to pagerank it would be 
interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of at 
a 
and aat 
 the same kind of analysis could be performed at 
the document level measuring document ease hopefully 
further analyses of the graph defined in this paper 
according to the approach described can be insightful for a better 
understanding of trec or similar data
