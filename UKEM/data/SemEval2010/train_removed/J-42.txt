abstract 
we present an analysis of a person-to-person 
recommendation network consisting of million people who made 
million recommendations on half a million products we 
observe the propagation of recommendations and the 
cascade sizes which we explain by a simple stochastic model 
we then establish how the recommendation network grows 
over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the 
sender and receiver of the recommendations while on 
average recommendations are not very effective at inducing 
purchases and do not spread very far we present a model 
that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for 
which viral marketing seems to be very effective

 introduction 
with consumers showing increasing resistance to 
traditional forms of advertising such as tv or newspaper ads 
marketers have turned to alternate strategies including 
viral marketing viral marketing exploits existing social 
networks by encouraging customers to share product 
information with their friends previously a few in depth 
studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of 
individual innovations and products for a review see 
or but until recently it has been difficult to measure 
how influential person-to-person recommendations actually 
are over a wide range of products we were able to directly 
measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by 
studying one online retailer s incentivised viral marketing 
program the website gave discounts to customers 
recommending any of its products to others and then tracked the 
resulting purchases and additional recommendations 
although word of mouth can be a powerful factor 
influencing purchasing decisions it can be tricky for advertisers 
to tap into some services used by individuals to 
communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing because the 
product can be observed or advertised as part of the 
communication email services such as hotmail and yahoo had 
very fast adoption curves because every email sent through 
them contained an advertisement for the service and because 
they were free hotmail spent a mere on traditional 
marketing and still grew from zero to million users in 
months google s gmail captured a significant part of 
market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign 
up for the service was through a referral 
most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way 
at the same time the choice of products available to 
consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers 
who can supply a much wider variety of products than 
traditional brick-and-mortar stores not only is the variety 
of products larger but one observes a  fat tail 
phenomenon where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively 
obscure items on amazon com somewhere between to 
 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top ranked 
products rhapsody a streaming-music service streams 
more tracks outside than inside its top tunes 
effectively advertising these niche products using traditional 
advertising approaches is impractical therefore using more 
targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the 
merchant and the consumer who would benefit from 
learning about new products 
the problem is partly addressed by the advent of 
online product and merchant reviews both at retail sites such 
as ebay and amazon and specialized product comparison 
sites such as epinions and cnet quantitative marketing 
techniques have been proposed and the rating of 
products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood 
of an item being bought of further help to the 
consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the 
form people who bought x also bought y feature 
these refinements help consumers discover new products 
 
and receive more accurate evaluations but they cannot 
completely substitute personalized recommendations that one 
receives from a friend or relative it is human nature to be 
more interested in what a friend buys than what an 
anonymous person buys to be more likely to trust their opinion 
and to be more influenced by their actions our friends are 
also acquainted with our needs and tastes and can make 
appropriate recommendations a lucid marketing survey 
found that of individuals consulted friends and relatives 
before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who 
used search engines to find product information 
several studies have attempted to model just this kind 
of network influence richardson and domingos used 
epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an 
algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that 
individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on 
the opinions on the trusted peers in their network kempe 
kleinberg and tardos evaluate the efficiency of several 
algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given 
various models of adoption while these models address the 
question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network 
they are based on assumed rather than measured influence 
effects 
in contrast in our study we are able to directly observe 
the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth 
advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time 
we find that most recommendation chains do not grow very 
large often terminating with the initial purchase of a 
product however occasionally a product will propagate through 
a very active recommendation network we propose a simple 
stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of 
recommendations moreover the characteristics of 
recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their 
members for example individuals likelihood of 
purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional 
recommendations for it but a saturation point is quickly 
reached interestingly as more recommendations are sent 
between the same two individuals the likelihood that they 
will be heeded decreases we also propose models to identify 
products for which viral marketing is effective we find that 
the category and price of product plays a role with 
recommendations of expensive products of interest to small well 
connected communities resulting in a purchase more often 
we also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations 
and purchases corresponding to times of day when people 
are likely to be shopping online or reading email we report 
on these and other findings in the following sections 
 the recommendation network 
 dataset description 
our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral 
program run by a large retailer the program rules were as 
follows each time a person purchases a book music or a 
movie he or she is given the option of sending emails 
recommending the item to friends the first person to purchase 
the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 
discount when this happens the sender of the 
recommendation receives a credit on their purchase 
the recommendation dataset consists of 
recommendations made among distinct users the 
data was collected from june to may in 
total products were recommended of them 
belonging to main product groups books dvds music 
and videos in addition to recommendation data we also 
crawled the retailer s website to obtain product categories 
reviews and ratings for all products of the products in our 
data set were discontinued the retailer no longer 
provided any information about them 
although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view 
of recommendation dynamics it does have its limitations 
the only indication of the success of a recommendation 
is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product 
through the same vendor we have no way of knowing if 
the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere 
borrow or otherwise obtain the product the delivery of the 
recommendation is also somewhat different from one person 
simply telling another about a product they enjoy possibly 
in the context of a broader discussion of similar products 
the recommendation is received as a form email including 
information about the discount program someone reading 
the email might consider it spam or at least deem it less 
important than a recommendation given in the context of 
a conversation the recipient may also doubt whether the 
friend is recommending the product because they think the 
recipient might enjoy it or are simply trying to get a 
discount for themselves finally because the recommendation 
takes place before the recommender receives the product 
it might not be based on a direct observation of the 
product nevertheless we believe that these recommendation 
networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth 
advertising and give us key insights into the influence of social 
networks on purchasing decisions 
 recommendation network statistics 
for each recommendation the dataset included the 
product and product price sender id receiver id the sent date 
and a buy-bit indicating whether the recommendation 
resulted in a purchase and discount the sender and receiver 
id s were shadowed we represent this data set as a 
directed multi graph the nodes represent customers and 
a directed edge contains all the information about the 
recommendation the edge i j p t indicates that i 
recommended product p to customer j at time t 
the typical process generating edges in the 
recommendation network is as follows a node i first buys a product p at 
time t and then it recommends it to nodes j jn the 
j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend 
it the only way for a node to recommend a product is to 
first buy it note that even if all nodes j buy a product 
only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase 
 within a week after the recommendation will be marked 
by a buy-bit because the buy-bit is set only for the first 
person who acts on a recommendation we identify additional 
purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for 
a person since all recommendations must be preceded by a 
purchase we call this type of evidence of purchase a 
buyedge note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the 
total number of purchases without discounts it is possible 
for a customer to not be the first to act on a 
recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others 
unfortunately this was not recorded in the data set we 
consider however the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for 
the total number of purchases through recommendations 
for each product group we took recommendations on all 
products from the group and created a network table

of products in the product group n the total number of 
nodes spanned by the group recommendation network and 
e the number of edges recommendations the column eu 
shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple 
recommendations between the same source and recipient 
in terms of the number of different items there are by far 
the most music cds followed by books and videos there 
is a surprisingly small number of dvd titles on the other 
hand dvds account for more half of all recommendations in 
the dataset the dvd network is also the most dense 
having about recommendations per node while books and 
music have about recommendations per node and videos 
have only a bit more than recommendation per node 
music recommendations reached about the same number 
of people as dvds but used more than times fewer 
recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes book 
recommendations reached by far the most people - 
million notice that all networks have a very small number 
of unique edges for books videos and music the number 
of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this 
suggests that the networks are highly disconnected 
figure a shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly 
connected component over time notice the component is 
very small even if we compose a network using all the 
recommendations in the dataset the largest connected 
component contains less than of the nodes and the 
second largest component has only nodes still some 
smaller communities numbering in the tens of thousands 
of purchasers of dvds in categories such as westerns 
classics and japanese animated films anime had connected 
components spanning about of their members 
the insert in figure a shows the growth of the 
customer base over time surprisingly it was linear adding on 
average new users each month which is an 
indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically 
further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the 
relatively high percentage of users who made their first 
recommendation without having previously received one 
back to table given the total number of 
recommendations e and purchases bb be influenced by 
recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need 
to be independently sent over the network to induce a new 
purchase using this metric books have the most influential 
recommendations followed by dvds and music for books 
one out of recommendations resulted in a purchase for 
dvds it increases to recommendations per purchase and 
further increases to for music and for video 
even with these simple counts we can make the first few 
observations it seems that some people got quite 
heavily involved in the recommendation program and that they 
tended to recommend a large number of products to the 
same set of friends since the number of unique edges is so 
small this shows that people tend to buy more dvds and 
also like to recommend them to their friends while they 
seem to be more conservative with books one possible 
reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a dvd 
one usually needs several days to read a book while a dvd 
can be viewed in a single evening 
one external factor which may be affecting the 
recommendation patterns for dvds is the existence of referral websites 
 www dvdtalk com on these websites people who want to 
buy a dvd and get a discount would ask for 
recommendations this way there would be recommendations made 
between people who don t really know each other but rather 
have an economic incentive to cooperate we were not able 
to find similar referral sharing sites for books or cds 
 forward recommendations 
not all people who make a purchase also decide to give 
recommendations so we estimate what fraction of people 
that purchase also decide to recommend forward to obtain 
this information we can only use the nodes with purchases 
that resulted in a discount 
the last columns of table show that only about a 
third of the people that purchase also recommend the 
product forward the ratio of forward recommendations is much 
higher for dvds than for other kinds of products videos 
also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations while 
books have the lowest this shows that people are most keen 
on recommending movies while more conservative when 
recommending books and music 
figure b shows the cumulative out-degree distribution 
that is the number of people who sent out at least kp 
recommendations for a product it shows that the deeper an 
individual is in the cascade if they choose to make 
recommendations they tend to recommend to a greater number 
of people on average the distribution has a higher 
variance this effect is probably due to only very heavily 
recommended products producing large enough cascades to 
reach a certain depth we also observe that the probability 
of an individual making a recommendation at all which can 
only occur if they make a purchase declines after an initial 
increase as one gets deeper into the cascade 
 identifying cascades 
as customers continue forwarding recommendations they 
contribute to the formation of cascades in order to 
identify cascades i e the causal propagation of 
recommendations we track successful recommendations as they influence 
purchases and further recommendations we define a 
recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first 
purchase we consider only the first purchase of an item

figure distribution of the number of 
recommendations and number of purchases made by a node 
purchases of the same product and in between those 
purchases she may have received new recommendations in this 
case one cannot conclude that recommendations following 
the first purchase influenced the later purchases 
each cascade is a network consisting of customers nodes 
who purchased the same product as a result of each other s 
recommendations edges we delete late recommendations 
- all incoming recommendations that happened after the 
first purchase of the product this way we make the 
network time increasing or causal - for each node all incoming 
edges recommendations occurred before all outgoing edges 
now each connected component represents a time obeying 
propagation of recommendations 
figure shows two typical product recommendation 
networks a a medical study guide and b a japanese graphic 
novel throughout the dataset we observe very similar 
patters most product recommendation networks consist of a 
large number of small disconnected components where we 
do not observe cascades then there is usually a small 
number of relatively small components with recommendations 
successfully propagating 
this observation is reflected in the heavy tailed 
distribution of cascade sizes see figure having a power-law 
exponent close to for dvds in particular 
we also notice bursts of recommendations figure b 
some nodes recommend to many friends forming a star like 
pattern figure shows the distribution of the 
recommendations and purchases made by a single node in the 
recommendation network notice the power-law distributions and 
long flat tails the most active person made 
recommendations and purchased different items finally 
we also sometimes observe  collisions where nodes receive 
recommendations from two or more sources a detailed 
enumeration and analysis of observed topological cascade 
patterns for this dataset is made in 
 the recommendation propagation model 
a simple model can help explain how the wide variance we 
observe in the number of recommendations made by 
individuals can lead to power-laws in cascade sizes figure the 
model assumes that each recipient of a recommendation will 
forward it to others if its value exceeds an arbitrary 
threshold that the individual sets for herself since exceeding this 
value is a probabilistic event let s call pt the probability 
that at time step t the recommendation exceeds the 
thresh

figure size distribution of cascades size of cascade vs count bold line presents a power-fit 
old in that case the number of recommendations nt at 
time t is given in terms of the number of 
recommendations at an earlier time by 
nt ptnt 
where the probability pt is defined over the unit interval 
notice that because of the probabilistic nature of the 
threshold being exceeded one can only compute the final 
distribution of recommendation chain lengths which we now 
proceed to do 
subtracting from both sides of this equation the term nt 
and diving by it we obtain 
n t − nt 
nt 
 pt − 
summing both sides from the initial time to some very 
large time t and assuming that for long times the numerator 
is smaller than the denominator a reasonable assumption 
we get 
dn 
n 
 pt 
the left hand integral is just ln n and the right hand 
side is a sum of random variables which in the limit of a very 
large uncorrelated number of recommendations is normally 
distributed central limit theorem 
this means that the logarithm of the number of messages 
is normally distributed or equivalently that the number of 
messages passed is log-normally distributed in other words 
the probability density for n is given by 
p n 
 
n 
√ 
 πσ 
exp 
− ln n − μ 
 σ 
 
which for large variances describes a behavior whereby 
the typical number of recommendations is small the mode 
of the distribution but there are unlikely events of large 
chains of recommendations which are also observable 
furthermore for large variances the lognormal 
distribution can behave like a power law for a range of values in 
order to see this take the logarithms on both sides of the 
equation equivalent to a log-log plot and one obtains 
ln p n − ln n − ln 
√ 
 πσ − 
 ln n − μ 
 σ 
 
so for large σ the last term of the right hand side goes 
to zero and since the the second term is a constant one 
obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of 
minus one there are other models which produce power-law 
distributions of cascade sizes but we present ours for its 
simplicity since it does not depend on network topology 
or critical thresholds in the probability of a recommendation 
being accepted 
 success of recommendations 
so far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the 
recommendation network next we ask questions about 
the effectiveness of recommendations in the 
recommendation network itself first we analyze the probability of 
purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations next 
we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people 
exchange more and more recommendations lastly we 
observe the recommendation network from the perspective of 
the sender of the recommendation does a node that makes 
more recommendations also influence more purchases 
 probability of buying versus number of 
incoming recommendations 
first we examine how the probability of purchasing changes 
as one gets more and more recommendations one would 
expect that a person is more likely to buy a product if she gets 
more recommendations on the other had one would also 
think that there is a saturation point - if a person hasn t 
bought a product after a number of recommendations they 
are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more 
of them so how many recommendations are too many 
figure shows the probability of purchasing a product 
as a function of the number of incoming recommendations 
on the product as we move to higher numbers of incoming 
recommendations the number of observations drops rapidly 
for example there were million cases with incoming 
recommendation on a book and only cases where a 
person got incoming recommendations on a particular book 
the maximum was incoming recommendations for these 
reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations 
becomes too small and the error bars too large 
figure a shows that overall book recommendations 
are rarely followed even more surprisingly as more and 
more recommendations are received their success decreases 
we observe a peak in probability of buying at incoming 
recommendations and then a slow drop 
for dvds figure b we observe a saturation around 
incoming recommendations this means that after a person 
gets recommendations on a particular dvd they 
become immune to them - their probability of buying does 
not increase anymore the number of observations is 
million at incoming recommendation and at 
incoming recommendations the maximal number of received 
recommendations is and that person did not buy

figure the effectiveness of recommendations 
with the total number of exchanged

 success of subsequent recommendations 
next we analyze how the effectiveness of 
recommendations changes as two persons exchange more and more 
recommendations a large number of exchanged 
recommendations can be a sign of trust and influence but a sender of too 
many recommendations can be perceived as a spammer a 
person who recommends only a few products will have her 
friends attention but one who floods her friends with all 
sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence 
we measure the effectiveness of recommendations as a 
function of the total number of previously exchanged 
recommendations between the two nodes we construct the 
experiment in the following way for every recommendation 
r on some product p between nodes u and v we first 
determine how many recommendations were exchanged between 
u and v before recommendation r then we check whether v 
the recipient of recommendation purchased p after 
recommendation r arrived for the experiment we consider only 
node pairs u v where there were at least a total of 
recommendations sent from u to v we perform the experiment 
using only recommendations from the same product group 
figure shows the probability of buying as a function of 
the total number of exchanged recommendations between 
two persons up to that point for books we observe that 
the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant 
up to exchanged recommendations as the number of 
exchanged recommendations increases the probability of 
buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and 
then levels off for dvds we observe an immediate and 
consistent drop this experiment shows that recommendations 
start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed 
between two people we performed the experiment also for 
video and music but the number of observations was too 
low and the measurements were noisy 
 success of outgoing recommendations 
in previous sections we examined the data from the 
viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation now we look 
from the viewpoint of the sender the two interesting 
questions are how does the probability of getting a credit 
change with the number of outgoing recommendations and 
given a number of outgoing recommendations how many 
purchases will they influence 
one would expect that recommendations would be the 
most effective when recommended to the right subset of 
friends if one is very selective and recommends to too few 
friends then the chances of success are slim one the other 
hand recommending to everyone and spamming them with 
recommendations may have limited returns as well 
the top row of figure shows how the average number 
of purchases changes with the number of outgoing 
recommendations for books music and videos the number of 
purchases soon saturates it grows fast up to around 
outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or 
starts to drop dvds exhibit different behavior with the 
expected number of purchases increasing throughout but 
if we plot the probability of getting a credit as a 
function of the number of outgoing recommendations as in the 
bottom row of figure we see that the success of dvd 
recommendations saturates as well while books videos and 
music have qualitatively similar trends the difference in 
the curves for dvd recommendations points to the presence 
of collisions in the dense dvd network which has 
recommendations per node and around per product - an 
order of magnitude more than other product groups this 
means that many different individuals are recommending to 
the same person and after that person makes a purchase 
even though all of them made a  successful recommendation

figure the time between the recommendation 
and the actual purchase we use all purchases 
by our definition only one of them receives a credit 
 timing of recommendations and 
purchases 
the recommendation referral program encourages people 
to purchase as soon as possible after they get a 
recommendation since this maximizes the probability of getting a 
discount we study the time lag between the recommendation 
and the purchase of different product groups effectively how 
long it takes a person to both receive a recommendation 
consider it and act on it 
we present the histograms of the thinking time i e the 
difference between the time of purchase and the time the last 
recommendation was received for the product prior to the 
purchase figure we use a bin size of day around 
 of book and dvd purchases occurred within a day after 
the last recommendation was received for dvds 
purchases occur more than a week after last recommendation 
while this drops to for books in contrast if we consider 
the lag between the purchase and the first recommendation 
only of dvd purchases are made within a day while the 
proportion stays the same for books this reflects a greater 
likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations 
for a dvd than for a book at the same time dvd 
recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations 
only one of which can result in a discount individuals then 
often miss their chance of a discount which is reflected in 
the high ratio of recommended dvd purchases that 
did not a get discount see table columns bb and be in 
contrast for books only of purchases through 
recommendations did not receive a discount 
we also measure the variation in intensity by time of day 
for three different activities in the recommendation system 
recommendations figure a all purchases figure b 
and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount 
 figure c each is given as a total count by hour of day 
the recommendations and purchases follow the same 
pattern the only small difference is that purchases reach a 
sharper peak in the afternoon after pm pacific time pm 
eastern time the purchases that resulted in a discount 
look like a negative image of the first two figures this means 
that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning 
when the traffic number of purchases recommendations on 
the retailer s website was low this makes a lot of sense since 
most of the recommendations happened during the day and 
if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first 
one to purchase she had the highest chances when the traffic 
on the website was the lowest

social networks are a product of the contexts that bring 
people together some contexts result in social ties that 
are more effective at conducting an action for example 
in small world experiments where participants attempt to 
reach a target individual through their chain of 
acquaintances profession trumped geography which in turn was 
more useful in locating a target than attributes such as 
religion or hobbies in the context of product 
recommendations we can ask whether a recommendation for a work

types can be found in the extended version of the paper for 
clarity we group the results by different category types 
fiction personal leisure professional technical and 
nonfiction other fiction encompasses categories such as sci-fi 
and romance as well as children s and young adult books 
personal leisure encompasses everything from gardening 
photography and cooking to health and religion 
first we compare the relative number of 
recommendations to reviews posted on the site column cav rp of 
table surprisingly we find that the number of people 
making personal recommendations was only a few times greater 
than the number of people posting a public review on the 
website we observe that fiction books have relatively few 
recommendations compared to the number of reviews while 
professional and technical books have more 
recommendations than reviews this could reflect several factors one is 
that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than 
technical books another is that they hesitate to recommend a 
work of fiction before reading it themselves since the 
recommendation must be made at the point of purchase yet 
another explanation is that the median price of a work of 
fiction is lower than that of a technical book this means 
that the discount received for successfully recommending a 
mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less 
incentive to send recommendations 
next we measure the per category efficacy of 
recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases 
occurring within a week following a recommendation to the 
number of recommenders for each book subject category 
 column b of table on average only of the 
recommenders of a book received a discount because their 
recommendation was accepted and another made a 
recommendation that resulted in a purchase but not a discount 
we observe marked differences in the response to 
recommendation for different categories of books fiction in general 
is not very effectively recommended with only around 
of recommenders succeeding the efficacy was a bit higher 
 around for non-fiction books dealing with personal and 
leisure pursuits but is significantly higher in the professional 
and technical category medical books have nearly double 
the average rate of recommendation acceptance this could 
be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical 
books and technical books in general as we will see in 
section a higher product price increases the chance that a 
recommendation will be accepted 
recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for 
certain religious categories for christian living and 
theology and for bibles in contrast books not tied 
to organized religions such as ones on the subject of new 
age and occult spirituality have lower 
recommendation effectiveness these results raise the interesting 
possibility that individuals have greater influence over one 
another in an organized context for example through a 
professional contact or a religious one there are exceptions of 
course for example japanese anime dvds have a strong 
following in the us and this is reflected in their frequency 
and success in recommendations another example is that of 
gardening in general recommendations for books relating 
to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted 
which agrees with the individual prerogative that 
accompanies this hobby at the same time orchid cultivation can be 
a highly organized and social activity with frequent  shows 
and online communities devoted entirely to orchids perhaps 
because of this the rate of acceptance of orchid book 
recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable 
or tomato growing 
 modeling the recommendation 
success 
we have examined the properties of recommendation 
network in relation to viral marketing but one question still 
remains what determines the product s viral marketing 
success we present a model which characterizes product 
categories for which recommendations are more likely to be 
accepted we use a regression of the following product 
attributes to correlate them with recommendation success 
 r number of recommendations 
 ns number of senders of recommendations 
 nr number of recipients of recommendations 
 p price of the product

from the original set of half a million products we 
compute a success rate s for the products that had at 
least one purchase made through a recommendation and for 
which a price was given in section we defined 
recommendation success rate s as the ratio of the total number 
purchases made through recommendations and the number 
of senders of the recommendations we decided to use this 
kind of normalization rather than normalizing by the total 
number of recommendations sent in order not to penalize 
communities where a few individuals send out many 
recommendations figure b since the variables follow a heavy 
tailed distribution we use the following model 
s exp 
i 
βi log xi i 
where xi are the product attributes as described on 
previous page and i is random error 
we fit the model using least squares and obtain the 
coefficients βi shown on table with the exception of the 
average rating they are all significant the only two 
attributes with a positive coefficient are the number of 
recommendations and price this shows that more expensive 
and more recommended products have a higher success rate 
the number of senders and receivers have large negative 
coefficients showing that successfully recommended products 
are more likely to be not so widely popular they have 
relatively many recommendations with a small number of 
senders and receivers which suggests a very dense 
recommendation network where lots of recommendations were 
exchanged between a small community of people 
these insights could be to marketers - personal 
recommendations are most effective in small densely connected 
communities enjoying expensive products

 discussion and conclusion 
although the retailer may have hoped to boost its 
revenues through viral marketing the additional purchases that 
resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket 
of sales that occur through the website nevertheless we 
were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how 
viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions 
made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling 
firstly it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that 
individuals have equal probability of being infected every 
time they interact contrary to this we observe that the 
probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction 
marketers should take heed that providing excessive 
incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire 
by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are 
trying to take advantage of 
traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also 
often assume that individuals either have a constant 
probability of  converting every time they interact with an 
infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of 
their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold in both 
cases an increasing number of infected contacts results in 
an increased likelihood of infection instead we find that 
the probability of purchasing a product increases with the 
number of recommendations received but quickly saturates 
to a constant and relatively low probability this means 
individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of 
their friends and resist buying items that they do not want 
in network-based epidemic models extremely highly 
connected individuals play a very important role for example 
in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes 
become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number 
of people but these models assume that a high degree node 
has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors 
as a low degree node does in contrast we find that there 
are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the 
recommendation network as a person sends out more and 
more recommendations past a certain number for a product 
the success per recommendation declines this would seem 
to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their 
friends but not everybody they know 
we also presented a simple stochastic model that allows 
for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few 
products but reflects well the general tendency of 
recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps 
we saw that the characteristics of product reviews and 
effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price 
with more successful recommendations being made on 
technical or religious books which presumably are placed in the 
social context of a school workplace or place of worship 
finally we presented a model which shows that smaller 
and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to 
viral marketing so despite the relative ineffectiveness of the 
viral marketing program in general we found a number of 
new insights which we hope will have general applicability 
to marketing strategies and to future models of viral
