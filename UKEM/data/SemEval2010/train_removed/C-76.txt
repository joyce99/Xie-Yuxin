abstract 
the paradigm shift from device-oriented to service-oriented 
management has also implications to the area of event 
correlation today s event correlation mainly addresses the 
correlation of events as reported from management tools 
however a correlation of user trouble reports concerning services 
should also be performed this is necessary to improve the 
resolution time and to reduce the effort for keeping the 
service agreements we refer to such a type of correlation as 
service-oriented event correlation the necessity to use this 
kind of event correlation is motivated in the paper 
to introduce service-oriented event correlation for an it 
service provider an appropriate modeling of the correlation 
workflow and of the information is necessary therefore we 
examine the process management frameworks it 
infrastructure library itil and enhanced telecom operations map 
 etom for their contribution to the workflow modeling in 
this area the different kinds of dependencies that we find 
in our general scenario are then used to develop a 
workflow for the service-oriented event correlation the mnm 
service model which is a generic model for it service 
management proposed by the munich network management 
 mnm team is used to derive an appropriate information 
modeling an example scenario the web hosting service 
of the leibniz supercomputing center lrz is used to 
demonstrate the application of service-oriented event

 introduction 
in huge networks a single fault can cause a burst of failure 
events to handle the flood of events and to find the root 
cause of a fault event correlation approaches like rule-based 
reasoning case-based reasoning or the codebook approach 
have been developed the main idea of correlation is to 
condense and structure events to retrieve meaningful 
information until now these approaches address primarily the 
correlation of events as reported from management tools or 
devices therefore we call them device-oriented 
in this paper we define a service as a set of functions 
which are offered by a provider to a customer at a customer 
provider interface the definition of a service is therefore 
more general than the definition of a web service but a 
web service is included in this service definition as 
a consequence the results are applicable for web services 
as well as for other kinds of services a service level 
agreement sla is defined as a contract between customer and 
provider about guaranteed service performance 
as in today s it environments the offering of such services 
with an agreed service quality becomes more and more 
important this change also affects the event correlation it 
has become a necessity for providers to offer such 
guarantees for a differentiation from other providers to avoid sla 
violations it is especially important for service providers to 
identify the root cause of a fault in a very short time or even 
act proactively the latter refers to the case of recognizing 
the influence of a device breakdown on the offered services 
as in this scenario the knowledge about services and their 
slas is used we call it service-oriented it can be addressed 
from two directions 
top-down perspective several customers report a 
problem in a certain time interval are these trouble 
reports correlated how to identify a resource as being 
the problem s root cause 
 
bottom-up perspective a device e g router server 
breaks down which services and especially which 
customers are affected by this fault 
the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 
 we describe how event correlation is performed today and 
present a selection of the state-of-the-art event correlation 
techniques section describes the motivation for 
serviceoriented event correlation and its benefits after having 
motivated the need for such type of correlation we use two 
well-known it service management models to gain 
requirements for an appropriate workflow modeling and present 
our proposal for it see section in section we present 
our information modeling which is derived from the mnm 
service model an application of the approach for a web 
hosting scenario is performed in section the last section 
concludes the paper and presents future work 
 today s event correlation 
techniques 
in the task of event correlation is defined as a 
conceptual interpretation procedure in the sense that a new 
meaning is assigned to a set of events that happen in a certain 
time interval we can distinguish between three aspects 
for event correlation 
functional aspect the correlation focuses on functions 
which are provided by each network element it is also 
regarded which other functions are used to provide a 
specific function 
topology aspect the correlation takes into account how 
the network elements are connected to each other and 
how they interact 
time aspect when explicitly regarding time constraints 
a start and end time has to be defined for each event 
the correlation can use time relationships between the 
events to perform the correlation this aspect is only 
mentioned in some papers but it has to be treated 
in an event correlation system 
in the event correlation it is also important to distinguish 
between the knowledge acquisition representation and the 
correlation algorithm examples of approaches to 
knowledge acquisition representation are gruschke s dependency 
graphs and ensel s dependency detection by neural 
networks it is also possible to find the dependencies by 
analyzing interactions in addition there is an approach 
to manage service dependencies with xml and to define a 
resource description framework 
to get an overview about device-oriented event correlation 
a selection of several event correlation techniques being used 
for this kind of correlation is presented 
model-based reasoning model-based reasoning mbr 
 represents a system by modeling each of its 
components a model can either represent a physical 
entity or a logical entity e g lan wan domain 
service business process the models for physical 
entities are called functional model while the models 
for all logical entities are called logical model a 
description of each model contains three categories of 
information attributes relations to other models and 
behavior the event correlation is a result of the 
collaboration among models 
as all components of a network are represented with 
their behavior in the model it is possible to perform 
simulations to predict how the whole network will 
behave 
a comparison in showed that a large mbr system 
is not in all cases easy to maintain it can be difficult to 
appropriately model the behavior for all components 
and their interactions correctly and completely 
an example system for mbr is netexpert from 
osi which is a hybrid mbr rbr system in osi 
was acquired by agilent technologies 
rule-based reasoning rule-based reasoning rbr 
 uses a set of rules for event correlation the rules 
have the form conclusion if condition the condition 
uses received events and information about the system 
while the conclusion contains actions which can either 
lead to system changes or use system parameters to 
choose the next rule 
an advantage of the approach is that the rules are 
more or less human-readable and therefore their effect 
is intuitive the correlation has proved to be very fast 
in practice by using the rete algorithm 
in the literature it is claimed that rbr 
systems are classified as relatively inflexible frequent 
changes in the modeled it environment would lead to 
many rule updates these changes would have to be 
performed by experts as no automation has currently 
been established in some systems information about 
the network topology which is needed for the event 
correlation is not used explicitly but is encoded into the 
rules this intransparent usage would make rule 
updates for topology changes quite difficult the system 
brittleness would also be a problem for rbr systems 
it means that the system fails if an unknown case 
occurs because the case cannot be mapped onto similar 
cases the output of rbr systems would also be 
difficult to predict because of unforeseen rule interactions 
in a large rule set according to an rbr system 
is only appropriate if the domain for which it is used 
is small nonchanging and well understood 
the gte impact system is an example of a 
rulebased system it also uses mbr gte has merged 
with bell atlantic in and is now called verizon 
 
codebook approach the codebook approach has 
similarities to rbr but takes a further step and 
encodes the rules into a correlation matrix 
the approach starts using a dependency graph with 
two kinds of nodes for the modeling the first kind 
of nodes are the faults denoted as problems in the 
cited papers which have to be detected while the 
second kind of nodes are observable events symptoms in 
the papers which are caused by the faults or other 
events the dependencies between the nodes are 
denoted as directed edges it is possible to choose weights 
for the edges e g a weight for the probability that 
 
fault event a causes event b another possible 
weighting could indicate time dependencies there are 
several possibilities to reduce the initial graph if e g 
a cyclic dependency of events exists and there are no 
probabilities for the cycles edges all events can be 
treated as one event 
after a final input graph is chosen the graph is 
transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns 
contain the faults and the rows contain the events 
if there is a dependency in the graph the weight of 
the corresponding edge is put into the according 
matrix cell in case no weights are used the matrix cells 
get the values for dependency and otherwise 
afterwards a simplification can be done where events 
which do not help to discriminate faults are deleted 
there is a trade-off between the minimization of the 
matrix and the robustness of the results if the matrix 
is minimized as much as possible some faults can only 
be distinguished by a single event if this event cannot 
be reliably detected the event correlation system 
cannot discriminate between the two faults a measure 
how many event observation errors can be 
compensated by the system is the hamming distance the 
number of rows events that can be deleted from the 
matrix can differ very much depending on the 
relationships 
the codebook approach has the advantage that it uses 
long-term experience with graphs and coding this 
experience is used to minimize the dependency graph 
and to select an optimal group of events with respect 
to processing time and robustness against noise 
a disadvantage of the approach could be that similar 
to rbr frequent changes in the environment make it 
necessary to frequently edit the input graph 
smarts incharge is an example of such a 
correlation system 
case-based reasoning in contrast to other approaches 
case-based reasoning cbr systems do not 
use any knowledge about the system structure the 
knowledge base saves cases with their values for system 
parameters and successful recovery actions for these 
cases the recovery actions are not performed by the 
cbr system in the first place but in most cases by a 
human operator 
if a new case appears the cbr system compares the 
current system parameters with the system 
parameters in prior cases and tries to find a similar one to 
identify such a match it has to be defined for which 
parameters the cases can differ or have to be the same 
if a match is found a learned action can be performed 
automatically or the operator can be informed with a 
recovery proposal 
an advantage of this approach is that the ability to 
learn is an integral part of it which is important for 
rapid changing environments 
there are also difficulties when applying the approach 
 the fields which are used to find a similar case 
and their importance have to be defined appropriately 
if there is a match with a similar case an adaptation 
of the previous solution to the current one has to be 
found 
an example system for cbr is spectrorx from 
cabletron systems the part of cabletron that developed 
spectrorx became an independent software company 
in and is now called aprisma management 
technologies 
in this section four event correlation approaches were 
presented which have evolved into commercial event correlation 
systems the correlation approaches have different focuses 
mbr mainly deals with the knowledge acquisition and 
representation while rbr and the codebook approach 
propose a correlation algorithm the focus of cbr is its ability 
to learn from prior cases 
 motivation of service-oriented 
event correlation 
fig shows a general service scenario upon which we 
will discuss the importance of a service-oriented correlation 
several services like ssh a web hosting service or a video 
conference service are offered by a provider to its customers 
at the customer provider interface a customer can allow 
several users to use a subscribed service the quality and 
cost issues of the subscribed services between a customer 
and a provider are agreed in slas on the provider side 
the services use subservices for their provisioning in case 
of the services mentioned above such subservices are dns 
proxy service and ip service both services and subservices 
depend on resources upon which they are provisioned as 
displayed in the figure a service can depend on more than 
one resource and a resource can be used by one or more 
services

user b

resources 
figure scenario 
to get a common understanding we distinguish between 
different types of events 
resource event we use the term resource event for 
network events and system events a network event refers 
to events like node up down or link up down whereas 
system events refer to events like server down or 
authentication failure 
service event a service event indicates that a service 
does not work properly a trouble ticket which is 
generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 
 
event other service events can be generated by the 
provider of a service if the provider himself detects a 
service malfunction 
in such a scenario the provider may receive service events 
from customers which indicate that ssh web hosting 
service and video conference service are not available when 
referring to the service hierarchy the provider can conclude 
in such a case that all services depend on dns therefore 
it seems more likely that a common resource which is 
necessary for this service does not work properly or is not 
available than to assume three independent service failures in 
contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the 
service events would have to be processed separately the 
service events can be linked together their information can 
be aggregated and processed only once if e g the problem 
is solved one common message to the customers that their 
services are available again is generated and distributed by 
using the list of linked service events this is certainly a 
simplified example however it shows the general principle of 
identifying the common subservices and common resources 
of different services 
it is important to note that the service-oriented 
perspective is needed to integrate service aspects especially qos 
aspects an example of such an aspect is that a fault does not 
lead to a total failure of a service but its qos parameters 
respectively agreed service levels at the customer-provider 
interface might not be met a degradation in service 
quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone 
is another example in the resource-oriented perspective it 
would be possible to define events which indicate that there 
is a link usage higher than a threshold but no mechanism 
has currently been established to find out which services are 
affected and whether a qos violation occurs 
to summarize the reasons for the necessity of a 
serviceoriented event correlation are the following 
keeping of slas top-down perspective the time 
interval between the first symptom recognized either 
by provider network management tools or customers 
that a service does not perform properly and the 
verified fault repair needs to be minimized this is 
especially needed with respect to slas as such agreements 
often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair 
effort reduction top-down perspective if several 
user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault 
fault processing should be performed only once and 
not several times if the fault has been repaired the 
affected customers should be informed about this 
automatically 
impact analysis bottom-up perspective in case of 
a fault in a resource its influence on the associated 
services and affected customers can be determined this 
analysis can be performed for short term when there 
is currently a resource failure or long term e g 
network optimization considerations 
 workflow modeling 
in the following we examine the established it process 
management frameworks it infrastructure library itil 
and enhanced telecom operations map etom the aim is 
find out where event correlation can be found in the process 
structure and how detailed the frameworks currently are 
after that we present our solution for a workflow modeling 
for the service-oriented event correlation 
 it infrastructure library itil 
the british office of government commerce ogc and 
the it service management forum itsmf provide a 
collection of best practices for it processes in the area of 
it service management which is called itil the service 
management is described by modules which are grouped 
into service support set provider internal processes and 
service delivery set processes at the customer-provider 
interface each module describes processes functions roles 
and responsibilities as well as necessary databases and 
interfaces in general itil describes contents processes and 
aims at a high abstraction level and contains no information 
about management architectures and tools 
the fault management is divided into incident 
management process and problem management process 
incident management the incident management 
contains the service desk as interface to customers e g 
receives reports about service problems in case of 
severe errors structured queries are transferred to the 
problem management 
problem management the problem management s 
tasks are to solve problems take care of keeping 
priorities minimize the reoccurrence of problems and to 
provide management information after receiving 
requests from the incident management the problem 
has to be identified and information about necessary 
countermeasures is transferred to the change 
management 
the itil processes describe only what has to be done but 
contain no information how this can be actually performed 
as a consequence event correlation is not part of the 
modeling the itil incidents could be regarded as input for the 
service-oriented event correlation while the output could be 
used as a query to the itil problem management 
 enhanced telecom operations map 
 etom 
the telemanagement forum tmf is an 
international non-profit organization from service providers and 
suppliers in the area of telecommunications services similar 
to itil a process-oriented framework has been developed at 
first but the framework was designed for a narrower focus 
i e the market of information and communications service 
providers a horizontal grouping into processes for 
customer care service development operations network 
systems management and partner supplier is performed the 
vertical grouping fulfillment assurance billing reflects the 
service life cycle 
in the area of fault management three processes have been 
defined along the horizontal process grouping 
problem handling the purpose of this process is to 
receive trouble reports from customers and to solve them 
by using the service problem management the aim 
is also to keep the customer informed about the 
current status of the trouble report processing as well as 
about the general network status e g planned 
maintenance it is also a task of this process to inform the 
 
qos sla management about the impact of current 
errors on the slas 
service problem management in this process reports 
about customer-affecting service failures are received 
and transformed their root causes are identified and 
a problem solution or a temporary workaround is 
established the task of the diagnose problem 
subprocess is to find the root cause of the problem by 
performing appropriate tests nothing is said how this 
can be done e g no event correlation is mentioned 
resource trouble management a subprocess of the 
resource trouble management is responsible for 
resource failure event analysis alarm correlation 
filtering and failure event detection reporting 
another subprocess is used to execute different tests to 
find a resource failure there is also another 
subprocess which keeps track about the status of the trouble 
report processing this subprocess is similar to the 
functionality of a trouble ticket system 
the process description in etom is not very detailed it 
is useful to have a check list which aspects for these processes 
have to be taken into account but there is no detailed 
modeling of the relationships and no methodology for applying 
the framework event correlation is only mentioned in the 
resource management but it is not used in the service level 
 workflow modeling for the 
service-oriented event correlation 
fig shows a general service scenario which we will use 
as basis for the workflow modeling for the service-oriented 
event correlation we assume that the dependencies are 
already known e g by using the approaches mentioned 
in section the provider offers different services which 
depend on other services called subservices service 
dependency another kind of dependency exists between 
services subservices and resources these dependencies are 
called resource dependencies these two kinds of 
dependencies are in most cases not used for the event correlation 
performed today this resource-oriented event correlation 
deals only with relationships on the resource level e g 
network topology 
service dependency 
resources 
subservices 
provider

resource dependency 
figure different kinds of dependencies for the 
service-oriented event correlation 
the dependencies depicted in figure reflect a situation 
with no redundancy in the service provisioning the 
relationships can be seen as and relationships in case of 
redundancy if e g a provider has independent web servers 
another modeling see figure should be used or 
relationship in such a case different relationships are possible 
the service could be seen as working properly if one of the 
servers is working or a certain percentage of them is working 
services 
 and relationship b or relationship 
resources 
figure modeling of no redundancy a and of 
redundancy b 
as both itil and etom contain no description how event 
correlation and especially service-oriented event correlation 
should actually be performed we propose the following 
design for such a workflow see fig the additional 
components which are not part of a device-oriented event 
correlation are depicted with a gray background the workflow is 
divided into the phases fault detection fault diagnosis and 
fault recovery 
in the fault detection phase resource events and service 
events can be generated from different sources the 
resource events are issued during the use of a resource e g 
via snmp traps the service events are originated from 
customer trouble reports which are reported via the customer 
service management see below access point in addition 
to these two passive ways to get the events a provider 
can also perform active tests these tests can either deal 
with the resources resource active probing or can assume 
the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its 
subservices by performing interactions at the service access 
points service active probing 
the fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event 
correlation steps the first one is performed by the resource 
event correlator which can be regarded as the event 
correlator in today s commercial systems therefore it deals only 
with resource events the service event correlator does a 
correlation of the service events while the aggregate event 
correlator finally performs a correlation of both resource and 
service events if the correlation result in one of the 
correlation steps shall be improved it is possible to go back to 
the fault detection phase and start the active probing to get 
additional events these events can be helpful to confirm a 
correlation result or to reduce the list of possible root causes 
after the event correlation an ordered list of possible root 
causes is checked by the resource management when the 
root cause is found the failure repair starts this last step 
is performed in the fault recovery phase 
the next subsections present different elements of the 
event correlation process

and provider its functionality is to provide information 
to the customer about his subscribed services e g reports 
about the fulfillment of agreed slas it can also be used to 
subscribe services or to allow the customer to manage his 
services in a restricted way reports about problems with a 
service can be sent to the customer via csm the csm is 
also contained in the mnm service model see section 
to reduce the effort for the provider s first level support 
an intelligent assistant can be added to the csm the 
intelligent assistant structures the customer s information about 
a service problem the information which is needed for a 
preclassification of the problem is gathered from a list of 
questions to the customer the list is not static as the 
current question depends on the answers to prior questions or 
from the result of specific tests a decision tree is used 
to structure the questions and tests the tests allow the 
customer to gain a controlled access to the provider s 
management at the lrz a customer of the e-mail service can 
e g use the intelligent assistant to perform ping requests 
to the mail server but also more complex requests could be 
possible e g requests of a combination of snmp variables 
 active probing 
active probing is useful for the provider to check his 
offered services the aim is to identify and react to problems 
before a customer notices them the probing can be done 
from a customer point of view or by testing the resources 
which are part of the services it can also be useful to 
perform tests of subservices own subservices or subservices 
offered by suppliers 
different schedules are possible to perform the active 
probing the provider could select to test important services 
and resources in regular time intervals other tests could 
be initiated by a user who traverses the decision tree of the 
intelligent assistant including active tests another 
possibility for the use of active probing is a request from the event 
correlator if the current correlation result needs to be 
improved the results of active probing are reported via service 
or resource events to the event correlator or if the test was 
demanded by the intelligent assistant the result is reported 
to it too while the events that are received from 
management tools and customers denote negative events something 
does not work the events from active probing should also 
contain positive events for a better discrimination 
 event correlator 
the event correlation should not be performed by a single 
event correlator but by using different steps the reason 
for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies 
 see fig 
on the resource level there are only relationships between 
resources network topology systems configuration an 
example for this could be a switch linking separate lans if 
the switch is down events are reported that other network 
components which are located behind the switch are also not 
reachable when correlating these events it can be figured 
out that the switch is the likely error cause at this stage 
the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful 
the result of this step is a list of resources which could be 
the problem s root cause the resource event correlator is 
used to perform this step 
in the service-oriented scenario there are also service and 
resource dependencies as next step in the event 
correlation process the service events should be correlated with 
each other using the service dependencies because the 
service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource 
level the result of this step which is performed by the 
service event correlator is a list of services subservices which 
could contain a failure in a resource if e g there are 
service events from customers that two services do not work 
and both services depend on a common subservice it seems 
more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the 
subservice the output of this correlation is a list of 
services subservices which could be affected by a failure in an 
associated resource 
in the last step the aggregate event correlator matches 
the lists from resource event correlator and service event 
correlator to find the problem s possible root cause this is 
done by using the resource dependencies 
the event correlation techniques presented in section 
could be used to perform the correlation inside the three 
event correlators if the dependencies can be found precisely 
an rbr or codebook approach seems to be appropriate a 
case database cbr could be used if there are cases which 
could not be covered by rbr or the codebook approach 
these cases could then be used to improve the modeling in 
a way that rbr or the codebook approach can deal with 
them in future correlations 
 information modeling 
in this section we use a generic model for it service 
management to derive the information necessary for the event 
correlation process 
 mnm service model 
the mnm service model is a generic model for it 
service management a distinction is made between customer 
side and provider side the customer side contains the 
basic roles customer and user while the provider side contains 
the role provider the provider makes the service available 
to the customer side the service as a whole is divided into 
usage which is accessed by the role user and management 
which is used by the role customer 
the model consists of two main views the service view 
 see fig shows a common perspective of the service for 
customer and provider everything that is only important 
 
for the service realization is not contained in this view for 
these details another perspective the realization view is 
defined see fig

figure realization view 
in the realization view the service implementation and the 
service management implementation are described in detail 
for both there are provider-internal resources and 
subservices for the service implementation a service logic uses 
internal resources devices knowledge staff and external 
subservices to provide the service analogous the service 
management implementation includes a service management 
logic using basic management functionalities and external 
management subservices 
the mnm service model can be used for a similar 
modeling of the used subservices i e the model can be applied 
recursively 
as the service-oriented event correlation has to use 
dependencies of a service from subservices and resources the 
model is used in the following to derive the needed 
information for service events 
 information modeling for service events 
today s event correlation deals mainly with events which 
are originated from resources beside a resource identifier 
these events contain information about the resource status 
e g snmp variables to perform a service-oriented event 
correlation it is necessary to define events which are related 
to services these events can be generated from the 
provider s own service surveillance or from customer reports 
at the csm interface they contain information about the 
problems with the agreed qos in our information 
modeling we define an event superclass which contains common 
attributes e g time stamp resource event and service 
event inherit from this superclass 
derived from the mnm service model we define the 
information necessary for a service event 
service as a service event shall represent the problems of 
a single service a unique identification of the affected 
service is contained here 
event description this field has to contain a description 
of the problem depending on the interactions at the 
service access point service view a classification of 
the problem into different categories should be defined 
it should also be possible to add an informal 
description of the problem 
qos parameters for each service qos parameters 
 service view are defined between the provider and the 
customer this field represents a list of these qos 
parameters and agreed service levels the list can help 
the provider to set the priority of a problem with 
respect to the service levels agreed 
resource list this list contains the resources realization 
view which are needed to provide the service this 
list is used by the provider to check if one of these 
resources causes the problem 
subservice service event identification in the service 
hierarchy realization view the service for which this 
service event has been issued may depend on 
subservices if there is a suspicion that one of these 
subservices causes the problem child service events are 
issued from this service event for the subservices in 
such a case this field contains links to the 
corresponding events 
other event identifications in the event correlation 
process the service event can be correlated with other 
service events or with resource events this field then 
contains links to other events which have been 
correlated to this service event this is useful to e g send a 
common message to all affected customers when their 
subscribed services are available again 
issuer s identification this field can either contain an 
identification of the customer who reported the 
problem an identification of a service provider s employee 
 
 in case the failure has been detected by the provider s 
own service active probing or a link to a parent 
service event the identification is needed if there are 
ambiguities in the service event or the issuer should 
be informed e g that the service is available again 
the possible issuers refer to the basic roles customer 
provider in the service model 
assignee to keep track of the processing the name and 
address of the provider s employee who is solving or 
solved the problem is also noted this is a 
specialization of the provider role in the service model 
dates this field contains key dates in the processing of the 
service event such as initial date problem 
identification date resolution date these dates are important 
to keep track how quick the problems have been solved 
status this field represents the service event s actual 
status e g active suspended solved 
priority the priority shows which importance the service 
event has from the provider s perspective the 
importance is derived from the service agreement especially 
the agreed qos parameters service view 
the fields date status and other service events are not 
derived directly from the service model but are necessary 
for the event correlation process 
 application of 
service-oriented event correlation for a 
web hosting scenario 
the leibniz supercomputing center is the joint 
computing center for the munich universities and research 
institutions it also runs the munich scientific network and offers 
related services one of these services is the virtual www 
server a web hosting offer for smaller research institutions 
it currently has approximately customers 
a subservice of the virtual www server is the 
storage service which stores the static and dynamic web pages 
and uses caching techniques for a fast access other 
subservices are dns and ip service when a user accesses a 
hosted web site via one of the lrz s virtual private 
networks the vpn service is also used the resources of the 
virtual www server include a load balancer and 
redundant servers the network connections are also part of the 
resources as well as the apache web server application 
running on the servers figure shows the dependencies of the 
virtual www server 
 customer service management and 
intelligent assistant 
the intelligent assistant that is available at the leibniz 
supercomputing center can currently be used for 
connectivity or performance problems or problems with the lrz 
e-mail service a selection of possible customer problem 
reports for the virtual www server is given in the

root causes are possible like a dns problem connectivity

 active probing 
in general active probing can be used for services or 
resources for the service active probing of the virtual www 
server a virtual customer could be installed this customer 
does typical http requests of web sites and compares the 
answer with the known content to check the up-to-dateness 
of a test web site the content could contain a time stamp 
the service active probing could also include the testing of 
subservices e g sending requests to the dns 
the resource active probing performs tests of the resources 
examples are connectivity tests requests to application 
processes and tests of available disk space 
 event correlation for the virtual www 
server 
figure shows the example processing at first a 
customer who takes a look at his hosted web site reports that 
the content that he had changed is not displayed correctly 
this report is transferred to the service management via 
the csm interface an intelligent assistant could be used 
to structure the customer report the service management 
translates the customer report into a service event 
independent from the customer report the service 
provider s own service active probing tries to change the content 
of a test web site because this is not possible a service 
event is issued 
meanwhile a resource event has been reported to the 
event correlator because an access of the content caching 
server to one of the www servers failed as there are no 
other events at the moment the resource event correlation

figure example processing of a customer report 
cannot correlate this event to other events at this stage 
it would be possible that the event correlator asks the 
resource management to perform an active probing of related 
resources 
both service events are now transferred to the service 
event correlator and are correlated from the correlation 
of these events it seems likely that either the www server 
itself or the link to the www server is the problem s root 
cause a wrong web site update procedure inside the 
content caching server seems to be less likely as this would only 
explain the customer report and not the service active 
probing result at this stage a service active probing could be 
started but this does not seem to be useful as this 
correlation only deals with the web hosting service and its 
resources and not with other services 
after the separate correlation of both resource and service 
events which can be performed in parallel the aggregate 
event correlator is used to correlate both types of events 
the additional resource event makes it seem much more 
likely that the problems are caused by a broken link to the 
www server or by the www server itself and not by the 
content caching server in this case the event correlator asks 
the resource management to check the link and the www 
server the decision between these two likely error causes 
can not be further automated here 
later the resource management finds out that a broken 
link is the failure s root cause it informs the event correlator 
about this and it can be determined that this explains all 
previous events therefore the event correlation can be 
stopped at this point 
depending on the provider s customer relationship 
management the finding of the root cause and an expected repair 
time could be reported to the customers after the link has 
been repaired it is possible to report this event via the csm 
interface 
even though many details of this event correlation process 
could also be performed differently the example showed an 
important advantage of the service-oriented event 
correlation the relationship between the service provisioning and 
the provider s resources is explicitly modeled this allows a 
mapping of the customer report onto the provider-internal 
resources 
 event correlation for different services 
if a provider like the lrz offers several services the 
serviceoriented event correlation can be used to reveal relationships 
that are not obvious in the first place if the lrz e-mail 
service and its events are viewed in relationship with the 
events for the virtual www server it is possible to identify 
failures in common subservices and resources both services 
depend on the dns which means that customer reports like 
i cannot retrieve new e-mail and the web site of my 
research institute is not available can have a common cause 
e g the dns does not work properly 
 conclusion and future work 
in our paper we showed the need for a service-oriented 
event correlation for an it service provider this new kind 
of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map 
problems with the current service quality onto resource 
failures this helps to find the failure s root cause earlier and 
to reduce costs for sla violations in addition customer 
reports can be linked together and therefore the processing 
effort can be reduced 
to receive these benefits we presented our approach for 
performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as 
a modeling of the necessary correlation information in the 
future we are going to apply our workflow and information 
modeling for services offered by the leibniz supercomputing 
center going further into details 
several issues have not been treated in detail so far e g 
the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if 
a subservice is offered by another provider if a service does 
not perform properly it has to be determined whether this 
is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice in 
the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged 
between the providers via the csm interface another issue 
is the use of active probing in the event correlation process 
which can improve the result but can also lead to a 
correlation delay 
another important point is the precise definition of 
dependency which has also been left out by many other 
publications to avoid having to much dependencies in a certain 
situation one could try to check whether the dependencies 
currently exist in case of a download from a web site there 
is only a dependency from the dns subservice at the 
beginning but after the address is resolved a download 
failure is unlikely to have been caused by the dns another 
possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service 
into its possible user interactions e g an e-mail service into 
transactions like get mail sent mail etc and to define the 
dependencies for each user interaction
